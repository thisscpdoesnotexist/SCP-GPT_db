No personnel are allowed to wear <i>SCP-10556</i> for any reason.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10556</i> is a black bicycle helmet commonly used in the late 20th century. It has a small crack on the right side of its front. When worn by a human being, <i>SCP-10556</i> will cause any vehicle it is mounted to crash, resulting in death of its rider. The person who wears <i>SCP-10556</i> and causes an accident will not be harmed and will be able to walk away from the scene without any injuries or marks on their body.<br><br>The Foundation recovered <i>SCP-10556</i> from ██████, Texas after reports of several accidents caused by cyclists wearing black helmets. All victims were killed instantly when their vehicles crashed into walls or other objects at high speeds . After investigation, all victims were found wearing black helmets similar to <i>SCP-10556</i>'s design . The Foundation discovered that these incidents were caused by <i>SCP-10556</i> when Agent ████████ wore it during testing .<br><br><i>SCP-10556</i> was first discovered in 19██ in Japan after several fatal accidents involving bicycles occurred near █████████ High School for Girls , which was known for its cycling club . All victims wore black bicycle helmets similar to those worn by students at the school's cycling club , but they could not be identified due to injuries sustained during crashes . As there was no evidence that these deaths were connected , they were treated as separate cases and covered up as traffic accidents involving drunk drivers . However , due to increasing number of deaths caused by cyclists wearing black helmets over time , police began investigating further and eventually discovered that all victims had been riding bicycles with members from the school's cycling club before dying under mysterious circumstances (see addendum 1056a). After discovering this connection between all deaths caused by cyclists wearing black helmets over time , police began investigating further and eventually discovered that all victims had been riding bicycles with members from the school's cycling club before dying under mysterious circumstances (see addendum 1056a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10556.1 : </h3>【LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED】<br><br><h3>Addendum 10556.2 : </h3>Interview with 【LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED】<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10556</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was performed after <i>SCP-10556</i>'s recovery . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, <i>SCP-10556</i>. <i>SCP-10556</i> is silent. <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Are you able to understand me?
