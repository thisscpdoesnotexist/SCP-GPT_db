<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-29044 comprises a set of seven (7) anomalously enhanced motor vehicles, styled as what can be referred to as 'carnival cars'. Each vehicle possesses distinct anthropomorphic features and appears to be sentient. The vehicles do not adhere to the known laws of physics and display capabilities inconceivable in conventional automobiles. The entity resembles a surrealistic carnival attraction, containing elements of vintage circus design mixed with mechanical, steampunk accents. The fleet consists of the following vehicles:</p>
<ol>
<li>SCP-29044-1: A vintage-style fire-engine red roadster with exaggerated chrome exhaust pipes; it appears to 'breathe' steam at regular intervals.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-2: A carousel-themed coupe with revolving horses and an organ that plays an eerie, continuous tune.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-3: A hearse with a constantly morphing dark cloud above it, emblazoned with haunting imagery associated with folklore and superstition.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-4: A hot-rod with shifting surrealist artwork on its panels, seemingly reflecting the viewer's subconscious fears.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-5: A bumper car with an electric field that defies gravity, allowing it to 'float' and 'bounce' in a manner impossible for typical bumper cars.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-6: A popcorn machine-themed truck spontaneously generating an unlimited quantity of popcorn that, when consumed, induces mild hallucinations.</li>
<li>SCP-29044-7: A Ferris-wheel hybrid vehicle, with seats that spin independently around the central axis, even while driving.</li>
</ol>
<p>The origin of SCP-29044 is unknown. They were first discovered at an abandoned fairground in ███████ after witnesses reported seeing a "phantom carnival" manifest at night.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-29044 is to be contained within a modified hangar at Site-██. This hangar has been custom fitted with reinforced containment barriers, soundproofing, and anti-electromagnetic field technology to prevent SCP-29044 from influencing or escaping the environment.</p>
<p>Each vehicle must be elevated from the ground and securely fastened when not in active testing, to prevent possible mobilization. Interaction with SCP-29044 is limited to D-class personnel during controlled experiments approved by at least two Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p>In the event that any vehicle becomes active outside of a controlled environment, Protocol CS-07 (“Mechanical Lullaby”) is to be initiated, which involves the playing of specific frequency tones that appear to 'soothe' SCP-29044 into a dormant state.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Recovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-29044 was recovered after several reports of a "ghostly carnival procession" traveling along desolate roads in rural ███████. During initial containment, two field agents were lost to SCP-29044-3 as the vehicle induced powerful cognitive dissonance, leading to their disappearance.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Logs</h3>
<h4>Experiment 29044-E1: Interaction with SCP-29044-2</h4>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██
<strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1056 was instructed to enter SCP-29044-2 and interact with the internal mechanism.
<strong>Results:</strong> D-1056 reported feeling a sense of nostalgia and euphoria. Upon exiting, D-1056 had developed an intense attachment to SCP-29044-2, leading to containment breach attempts. D-1056 was terminated after third breach attempt.</p>
<h4>Experiment 29044-E2: Testing SCP-29044-6 Popcorn Consumption</h4>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██
<strong>Procedure:</strong> D-4641 was instructed to consume popcorn generated by SCP-29044-6.
<strong>Results:</strong> D-4641 began to experience vivid hallucinations, claiming to see a "fifth-dimensional circus". Effects subsided after six hours. D-4641 retained an aversion to popcorn post-experiment.</p>
<h4>Experiment 29044-E3: Pace Trial with SCP-29044-7</h4>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██
<strong>Procedure:</strong> D-7293 was instructed to operate SCP-29044-7 in a controlled outdoor environment.
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-29044-7 accelerated beyond safety thresholds, with seat rotations reaching dangerous velocities. D-7293 was successfully extracted, suffering from severe vertigo and several broken bones.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Report 29044-01</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-29044 became collectively active without external stimulus, using anomalous abilities to disable containment measures. Site-wide power fluctuations and psychological effects on personnel were reported.</p>
<p>The manifestation of an otherworldly "carnival" around the hangar was witnessed, complete with eerie music and spectral entities. Recovery was successful after initiating Protocol CS-07.</p>
<p>Following the incident, SCP-29044's containment procedures were revised to include preemptive measures against such manifestations. Further research into SCP-29044's origins and potential connections to other anomalous phenomena is ongoing.</p>
