It appears to be completely harmless, though it has the ability to teleport at will. When it teleports, its destination is always unknown and unpredictable; however, it has been observed that the cat often reappears in locations where there are large concentrations of people or animals.<br><br>When active, <i>SCP-24959</i> displays an unusual level of intelligence and curiosity. It often appears to observe its surroundings before teleporting away again. In addition, when approached by researchers or personnel attempting to capture it for study purposes, <i>SCP-24959</i> will become hostile and attempt to escape using its teleportation abilities.<br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-24959</i>'s teleportation ability as well as its tendency towards aggression when approached by humans or other animals, containment protocols have been difficult for Foundation personnel to maintain successfully; as such, containment efforts are ongoing and subject to frequent review from senior staff members assigned with managing this object's containment procedures.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24959</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must have a minimum of three (3) walls constructed from reinforced steel, and the door must be equipped with an electronic locking system.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-24959</i>'s containment are to wear protective gear when entering its containment chamber, as it has been known to become hostile towards personnel attempting to capture it for study purposes. Additionally, personnel are not allowed to enter the containment chamber unless they have received authorization from senior staff members assigned with managing this object's containment procedures.<br><br>In order to prevent unauthorized teleportation of <i>SCP-24959</i>, the area surrounding its containment chamber is monitored by motion sensors and cameras at all times. Any unauthorized<br><br><h3> Addendum 24959.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-24959</i> was observed to have teleported into the office of Dr. ███████, a researcher assigned to its containment procedures. Upon arriving in the room, it began to meow loudly and attempted to escape when approached by personnel. After several minutes of pursuit and attempts at capture, <i>SCP-24959</i> eventually managed to teleport away again; however, it left behind several strands of fur which were collected for further study. Analysis revealed that these hairs contained a previously unknown compound which was determined to be linked with its teleportation ability. Further research is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24959.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24959</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, Dr. ███████ attempted to interview <i>SCP-24959</i> in order to gain further insight into its behavior and abilities. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Hello there, little one. What's your name? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24959</i>:</b> [No response] <br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> That's okay, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Can you tell me why you like to teleport so much? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24959</i>:</b> [Pauses for several seconds before responding] I like it because it lets me explore new places and meet new people… and animals. <br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> That sounds like fun. Do you ever get scared when you teleport? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24959</i>:</b> [Pauses for several seconds before responding] Sometimes, but usually I'm just excited to see what's out there.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24959.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 24959-1:</b> On ██/██/████, a Class-D personnel was instructed to enter <i>SCP-24959</i>'s containment chamber and attempt to capture it for study purposes. Upon entering the chamber, <i>SCP-24959</i> immediately became hostile and attempted to escape using its teleportation ability. The experiment ended when the Class-D personnel managed to corner the cat in a corner of the room and successfully restrain it.</div>
