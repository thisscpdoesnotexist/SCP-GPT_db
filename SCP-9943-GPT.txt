Upon recovery, it was discovered that <i>SCP-9943</i> had been living in the basement of [REDACTED] High School for several months prior to its discovery. During this time period, <i>SCP-9943</i> would enter the dreams of students attending [REDACTED] High School by unknown means and attempt to convince them to join a <i>"revolution"</i> against what it refers to as <i>"The System"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-9943</i>'s anomalous properties manifest within dream states only when the subject being targeted is between the ages of 12 and 25 years old . When this occurs, subjects will experience vivid hallucinations which appear similar to scenes from a typical action movie or video game . The hallucinations will often feature instances where subjects are placed into dangerous situations , such as being chased by armed gunmen or encountering large groups of hostile individuals . While these situations are occurring , subjects will be unable to move their bodies until they are awoken by either themselves or another person who has also been affected by SCP- 99 43 's abilities . Subjects have reported feeling physically exhausted after these events occur , regardless if they were able to escape danger during their hallucination or not . Additionally , subjects have reported having difficulty sleeping for up to two days following an encounter with SCP - 99 43 due t o anxiety caused b y their encounters with him while asleep . Testing has shown that these effects do not occur when testing D - class personnel who do not fall within the aforementioned age range ; however , testing with other sapient animals (such as dogs) has resulted in no anomalous effects occuring at all upon them regardless if they fall under this age range or not . See Addendum A for more information on testing involving nonhuman test subjects .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9943.2 : </h3>Interview with ??????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9943</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ after the events of Experiment 9943-A . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-9943</i>. I'd like to ask you some questions about what happened during your last experiment . <br><br><b><i>SCP-9943</i>: </b>I don't know what you're talking about, man . You can't pin this shit on me ! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>We have witnesses who saw you enter the room where the test was being conducted, and we have video footage of you entering their dreams and trying to convince them to join your revolution against <i>"The System"</i>. Now, why did you do that? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9943</i>: </b>What? That's bullshit ! I didn't do any of that shit ! This is just another one of those mind control experiments , isn't it ? Those assholes are trying to control my mind again , aren 't they ? Fuck them! They can go fuck themselves! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this exchange took place, a brief physical altercation occurred between SCP - 99 43 and security personnel present in its cell before it was successfully restrained; however , no lasting damage resulted from this incident . Following this event, further testing involving nonhuman test subjects has been suspended until further notice .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9943.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br>Subject(s): D-9943, a 23 year old female.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9943 is placed in <i>SCP-9943</i>'s containment cell. <i>SCP-9943</i> is then instructed to enter the subject's dream state and attempt to convince her to join his <i>"revolution"</i>. Subject is monitored by two security personnel who are stationed outside of the cell at all times, as well as one (1) Level 3 researcher who supervises the experiment from within Site-19. The subject is awoken once she has been released from SCP - 99 43 's effects . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon being released from SCP - 99 43 's effects , subject reported having a dream where she was being chased by several armed gunmen through an alleyway at night . Subject reports that while running away from the gunmen, she tripped and fell into a large puddle of mud that appeared out of nowhere . While lying on her back in this puddle , several rats emerged from it and began crawling over her body . The gunmen then approached her , but were unable to reach her due to their legs becoming entangled in the rats' bodies . Once this occurred, D - 99 43 woke up screaming and reported feeling extremely anxious for three days following this event. <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It appears that SCP - 99 43 only affects subjects when they are asleep ; however , further testing involving different test subjects will be needed before any conclusions can be made regarding its anomalous properties. + Experiment #: 2 - Close Experiment #2 Test Log <br><br><b>Date: </b>11/23/20██ Subject(s): One (1) adult male dog weighing approximately 20 kilograms <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dog was placed under general anesthesia before being brought into <i>SCP-9</i> 9 4 3' s containment cell via wheeled stretcher with two (2) security personnel present during transport; both of these personnel remained outside of the cell during testing.
