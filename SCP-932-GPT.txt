Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:


SCP-932-GPT is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-932-GPT is to be monitored at all time via closed circuit camera. In the event of SCP-932-GPT demonstrating any anomalous behaviour, it is to be preformed on by D-class personnel until its effects wear off. Any personnel who have been affected by SCP-932's anomalous properties are not allowed to return to active duty for a period of no less than one year.


Description:

SCP-932-GPT is a Caucasian male, approximately 30 years of age, named ████████ ██████████. SCP-932-GPT has the ability to make other people believe that they are him, regardless of whether or not they are aware of their condition. This ability manifests itself in humans as an attachment to SCP-932-GPT's body in which they slowly become more and more like it. The speed at which this process takes place is dependent on the number of individuals affected; however, it has been observed that there is a minimum amount of people needed for the effect to take place

Discovery: SCP-932-GPT was brought to the attention of the Foundation after a series of disappearances in ████████, USA. SCP-932-GPT was found after a police raid on a suspected drug den. SCP-932-GPT was arrested on charges of drug trafficking, but escaped during transport and fled into the nearby woods.

SCP-932-GPT made its way to [REDACTED], where it lived as an hermit for nearly 6 years before it was apprehended by local law enforcement officers and placed in custody.

SCP-932's anomaly was discovered when it attempted to commit suicide by cop. SCP-932-GPT was found on a rooftop of an apartment complex and surrounded by police officers in full riot gear, brandishing assault rifles. SCP-932-GPT was shot once and fell from the roof to the street, where it died instantly.

SCP-932's anomalous properties were discovered when the officers who shot SCP-932-GPT began to believe that they were him. They were placed under quarantine and questioned regarding their beliefs, after which they believed that they were indeed ████████ ██████████. However, upon further questioning they could not remember details of their lives prior to becoming SCP-932-GPT.

Subjects affected by SCP-932's anomalous properties do not seem to be able to remember details of their life before becoming SCP-932 as long as they are affected. When questioned about their previous life the subjects will become agitated and will refer to themselves as ████████ ██████████ until further notice.

Discovery: SCP-932-GPT was revealed after a series of disappearances in ████████, USA. SCP-932-GPT was found after a police raid on a suspected drug den. SCP-932 escaped during transport and fled into the nearby woods.

SCP-932 made its way to [REDACTED], where it lived as an hermit for nearly 6 years before it was apprehended by local law enforcement officers and placed in custody. After being sentenced to life imprisonment in ███████ Maximum Security Prison, SCP-932 committed suicide by hanging himself with his bedsheets. An autopsy revealed that SCP-932 had been dead for several days prior to the execution of its plan.

Addendum: SCP-932-GPT's cell is to be monitored at all times via closed circuit camera. In the event of SCP-932-GPT demonstrating any anomalous behaviour, it is to be preformed on by D-class personnel until its effects wear off. Any personnel who have been affected by SCP-932's anomalous properties are not allowed to return to active duty for a period of no less than one year.

SCP-932 is currently being held in Site ██'s Humanoid Containment Cell Wing. Any personnel who enter SCP-932's containment cell are required to wear full hazmat gear and a respirator.

Addendum 2: The following is a conversation between ████████ and SCP-932-GPT, recorded by security personnel on assignment at Site ██.

████████: So what's your deal, ████████? Got a bad attitude or something?
SCP-932-GPT: Fuck you. I'm the last person that needs to justify what I do.
████████: Well, I don't care if you think you're better than me, but if you wanna live another day in this place, then you better realize who the fuck I am.
SCP-932-GPT: Who am I? Really? Who am I? Hah! That's fucking rich!
████████: Come on man, don't play dumb with me! You know damn well who I am!
SCP-932-GPT: No I don't. And neither do you!

████████ paused for several moments and began to visibly shake before leaving the room.
