The cell must be kept completely dark at all times, and the lights are to be turned off before anyone enters or leaves the room (see Addendum 10537-3). <i>SCP-10537</i> is not allowed any visitors, and all personnel who work with it must have their eyes removed before entering its containment chamber.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10537</i> is a sentient creature that can only be seen by people who have had their eyes removed. It is approximately 1.5 meters tall, and has a large mouth full of sharp teeth. <i>SCP-10537</i>'s head seems to be made of a hard material similar to bone, and its body appears to be made of an unknown substance that resembles wood.<br><br><i>SCP-10537</i> was first discovered in ██████, Illinois on ██/██/19██ when several children reported seeing it in their homes at night. The Foundation was alerted after the police were unable to find any evidence of its existence following multiple reports from the children's parents about strange occurrences happening inside their homes at night (see Addendum 10537-1). A team was sent out to investigate shortly after and <i>SCP-10537</i> was contained shortly afterwards with minimal resistance (see Addendum 10537-2).<br><br><i>SCP-10537</i> has been observed moving around freely within its containment cell during the day as if it were invisible; however, it cannot leave the area or interact with anything outside its cell unless someone with no eyes sees it while they are sleeping at night. Upon waking up in the morning, subjects report having vivid nightmares where they see <i>SCP-10537</i> attacking them or someone else they know personally (see Addendum 10538 for more information). If this happens, then <i>SCP-10537</i> will attempt to kill whoever is being dreamed about until sunrise; however, if no one sees it again before sunrise then all effects will cease immediately and all memories regarding these events will disappear from everyone involved completely . This effect also applies when someone sees <i>SCP-10557</i> during daylight hours as well; however there have been no reports stating that this has happened yet .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10537.1 : </h3>【 LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED 】<br><br><h3>Addendum 10537.2 : </h3>Interview with 【 LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED 】 <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-10537 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-10537 was chosen for this interview as he has been working with <i>SCP-10537</i> the longest out of all the personnel who have worked with it. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, D-10537. Please state your name and occupation for the record. <br><br><b>D-10537: </b>My name is ████, I'm a security guard at Site 19 and I've been working with <i>SCP-10</i>… uhh… 10537 since it came here in 19██. Dr. █████ nods and writes something down on his clipboard before speaking again; however, due to a malfunction in his microphone only static can be heard during the next few seconds of dialogue between him and D-10537 before he speaks again . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>What do you know about SCP 105… (static) …seen it? (static) You said you've worked with it for years now, so I assume that means you've seen it too? (static) Do you think we should keep trying to contain this thing or just let it go? (static) …(inaudible speech from both parties for several seconds before returning to normal volume levels). Can you repeat that last part please? It sounded like you said <i>"I don't know what's worse…"</i> but I couldn't quite make out what else after that because of the interference on my end . There is more static coming from both parties' microphones followed by silence until they speak again . The following conversation reveals more information about SCP - 105 37 than any other interview conducted so far; however, due to all audio recordings being corrupted during this segment of the interview no transcript will be provided here . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing all available data regarding this incident we have come to two conclusions regarding how SCP - 1 0 5 3 7 operates; firstly , if someone sees SCP - 1 0 5 3 7 while they are awake then they will not remember anything related to seeing or interacting with it afterwards ; secondly , if someone sees an image or depiction of SCP - 1 0 5 3 7 while they are sleeping then that person will suffer from vivid nightmares where they see themselves being attacked by an unknown entity until sunrise when these effects cease immediately afterwards .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10537.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 10537-01<br><br>Subject(s): D-10537, a Class-D personnel who had his eyes removed.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is to enter the containment cell alone and wait until <i>SCP-10537</i> appears in front of him. The lights are then turned off and the subject is to remain in the room until sunrise. After sunrise, he is then to describe what happened during that time period. The subject's eyes are then reinserted and he is questioned about his experience with <i>SCP-10537</i> during daylight hours before being released from Foundation custody.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reports seeing nothing unusual when entering the room; however, after turning off the lights he claims that he could see something moving around freely within its containment cell as if it were invisible . He also states that it was <i>"glowing slightly"</i> but goes on to say that it was hard for him to tell because of how dark it was inside of there . When asked about what happened after sunrise, subject says that nothing happened at all; however, when asked if anyone else had seen something unusual while they were asleep at night or during daytime hours (specifically mentioning Dr. ██████), subject becomes visibly shaken and refuses to answer any further questions regarding this matter .<br><br>Experiment #: 10537-02</div>
