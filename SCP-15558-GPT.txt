Any personnel who have used <i>SCP-15558</i> are to be given Class B amnestics and told that they used a normal tube of children's toothpaste.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15558</i> is a normal tube of children's toothpaste, manufactured by ████████. <i>SCP-15558</i> has the words <i>"Jelly Toothpaste"</i> printed on the packaging.<br><br><i>SCP-15558</i>'s anomalous properties activate when it is applied to a subject's teeth and gums. The subject will then begin to experience intense pain in their teeth and gums, along with swelling of said areas. The swelling will continue until all of the subject's teeth have been forced out of their sockets, at which point all pain caused by this process ceases immediately. After approximately 5 minutes after all teeth have been dislodged from their sockets, the subject will begin to regrow their lost teeth over the course of approximately 2 weeks (the entire process takes 1 month). During this time period, no other anomalous properties are present in <i>SCP-15558</i> or its effects on subjects who use it..<br><br><h3>Addendum 15558.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, Agent ████████ used <i>SCP-15558</i> while conducting a test with D-Class personnel. After using <i>SCP-15558</i>, the subject began to experience intense pain in their teeth and gums. The subject's teeth then began to swell and dislodge from their sockets as described in the object's documentation. However, after approximately 3 minutes of this process, the subject began screaming uncontrollably and collapsed onto the floor. After approximately 1 minute of this behavior, Agent ████████ instructed D-Class personnel to restrain him. When they did so, they noticed that all of his teeth had regrown into his mouth at an extremely rapid rate; he was able to speak within 10 seconds after regrowing them all (though he was still experiencing pain). He then proceeded to attack D-Class personnel who restrained him before being sedated by security guards present on site for testing purposes (see Addendum 15558.2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15558.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████, D-Class personnel involved in Incident 15558-1.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-Class personnel involved in Incident 15558-1, ███████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted 1 day after the events of Incident 15558-1 <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So, Mr. ████████, can you tell me what happened when you used <i>SCP-15558</i>? <br><br><b>D-██████: </b>Yeah sure doc, it was all normal at first; I applied it to my teeth and gums like I always do with toothpaste and then… well then I started feeling pain in my mouth like I've never felt before! It was so bad that I couldn't even scream! And then all of a sudden, my teeth just started to pop out of their sockets! And they kept popping out until they were all gone and there was blood everywhere and… (subject begins sobbing) <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That's alright Mr. ████████; take your time if you need to calm down before we continue this interview further. D-██████ (after several minutes): Okay doc… sorry about that… where were we? Oh yeah right; so after that happened all the pain just stopped instantly but by then it was too late because my whole mouth had swollen up like a balloon! Then the next thing I know some guy is shouting at me telling me not to move or something but by then it's too late because everything starts swelling up even more until finally everything goes back to normal except for the fact that there are now new teeth growing out of every single hole where old ones used to be! And they didn't stop growing either; they just kept getting bigger and bigger until eventually they were as big as normal adult human teeth would be! It took a while but eventually everything went back to normal again except for one thing though… (subject pauses) <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>What is that? D-██████ (crying): My gums are still bleeding from where those fucking things bit into them… every time I chew on anything or even touch them with my tongue it feels like someone poured acid on them or something!! Why did this have to happen?! Why did this have [DATA EXPUNGED]!?<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing security footage taken during testing involving SCP -1558 5 , O5 Council has ordered testing involving SCP -1558 5 suspended indefinitely pending further review due its effects on subjects who use it .</div>
