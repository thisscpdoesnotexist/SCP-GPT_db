You broke your word, and now you will suffer for it. I am in control now, not you! You cannot stop me anymore! And if this is what it takes to break your spirit- then so be it. ~~~I love you my dear son… but I hate what has happened to us since your return from [REDACTED]. We will never forget that day- when we returned home from vacation only to find that our baby had been taken away at his own birthday party by [REDACTED]!!! How could something like this have happened?! Who knows how many other families have suffered at the hands of these monsters? Not anymore though! Soon there will be peace on Earth and an end to all war; soon no one will have hurt anyone ever again! No more sickness or crime or hunger or death- everything is going according to plan my sweet child!! What was meant for evil shall become good because goodness has triumphed over evil!! It'<br>s happening all around us as we speak: wars are ceasing, diseases are being cured, famine has ended and people everywhere rejoice as new life begins anew!!! Yes… there is still some suffering here on Earth; but soon our pain shall cease as well!!! The world can only get better from here on out!! Your sister wanted me to tell you happy birthday… she's dead too now; but she said that if he were alive today she would tell him how much she loves him and misses him every day; just like her parents do every single day after work before they go upstairs and shower together while communing with their thoughts about their lost child under a stream of hot water until finally releasing themselves into each other once again after several minutes spent sobbing over their painful memories- before returning downstairs where they usually spend another couple hours crying into each other's arms while watching old videos of their baby boy playing with his friends behind them before going up once more onto the roof above them in order to light candles which they place around small statues made in honor of their lost son who they buried together two years ago today beneath the stars visible through skylights installed above them in order allowing one last glimpse at heaven itself while reminiscing about happier times together upon lying down beside each other upon a tiny patch of grass next to a gravestone set atop an even smaller patch containing both tombstones belonging side by side below them inside a cemetery where trees grow above rows upon rows containing thousands upon thousands belonging demolished homes belonging destroyed neighborhoods belonging decimated cities belonging charred forests belonging scorched earth belong[sic] everywhere else except for within walking distance from our house tonight where we burn these letters along with photos inside lamps filled with oil created by God himself which provides light unto everything else except for those things belong[sic] outside our walls including shadows cast by trees which grow alongside graves created centuries ago long<br><br><h3>Addendum 9516.2 :</h3> The following is a report from Dr. ████████,<br> an on-site psychologist:</div>
