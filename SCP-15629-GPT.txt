<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15629</i> is  the United States of America</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15629</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15629</i> is to be contained by MTF Alpha - 1 (<i>"Red Right Hand"</i>). <i>SCP-15629</i> is to be monitored at all times, with any changes in its status reported to the Foundation immediately. Any personnel entering <i>SCP-15629</i> are required to wear a full hazmat suit at all times; failure to do so will result in termination.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15629</i> is the United States of America, which has been converted into a massive anomalous structure. <i>SCP-15629</i> is located in the Pacific Ocean, and has been modified to resemble a large city. The majority of <i>SCP-15629</i>'s buildings are composed of concrete and steel, with several skyscrapers reaching heights of over 500 meters. The entirety of <i>SCP-15629</i> is covered in graffiti and other forms of vandalism.<br><br><i>SCP-15629</i>'s interior consists primarily of an intricate network consisting primarily concrete hallways with occasional rooms containing various anomalous objects or entities. Most rooms contain signs indicating their purpose; however, several rooms have no discernible purpose as they are blocked off from the rest of <i>SCP-15629</i> by collapsed sections or other obstacles.<br><br><i>SCP-15629</i> was discovered after reports surfaced from civilians living on nearby islands claiming that they had seen <i>"an entire city rise out from the ocean"</i>. Foundation personnel were dispatched to investigate these claims; after arriving on site, it was confirmed that these claims were true and that the aforementioned city was indeed a former part of the United States mainland. Several instances later classified as SCP-███ were also found within this area; all instances have since been contained by MTF Alpha - 1 (<i>"Red Right Hand"</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15629.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████, a local fisherman who claims to have been the first person to discover <i>SCP-15629</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-15629</i> was discovered. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent ███: Could you please state your name for the record? Subject is silent for several seconds. <br><br><b>Subject: </b>My name is… my name is… my name… Agent ███: Please answer the question. Subject appears to be in distress, and begins to shake slightly. After several seconds, subject stammers out a response. <br><br><b>Subject: </b>My n-name is D-Donnie W-White! I'm from Bakersfield! I can't remember anything else! Where am I? What happened? Agent ███ sighs before speaking again. Agent ███: Mr White, we've already established that you are from Bakersfield; however, you seem confused as to where exactly you are now and what has happened here recently. Can you tell me what's going on? Again, subject remains silent for several seconds before responding with a different voice entirely; this voice sounds much older than subject's previous one and has an accent that does not match any known dialect of American English or Spanish . Voice 1 (Subject): You're in deep shit now kid; they'll be here soon so don't try anything funny or else they'll kill us both! You need to get out of here while there's still time! There's no way out of this place except through them damn tunnels down below but it ain't safe down there either so just run away as fast as you can while there still might be some hope left for ya' kid! Now go on get moving before it's too late… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At this point in time it was confirmed that multiple entities were possessing █████ at once (see Addendum 15629 -3). All instances were subsequently terminated by MTF Alpha - 1 (<i>"Red Right Hand"</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15629.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15629-1:<br><br><b>Objective: </b>To determine the extent of <i>SCP-15629</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-Class personnel were instructed to enter <i>SCP-15629</i> and explore its interior. Upon exiting, D-Class personnel were instructed to describe any changes that had occurred within <i>SCP-15629</i>. After being given a short break, D-Class personnel was then asked to reenter <i>SCP-15629</i> and repeat the process described above. The following is an excerpt from the transcript of Experiment 15629 - 1.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>D-[REDACTED]: </b>Alright, I'm going in now.<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please proceed; we'll be monitoring you from here on out via CCTV footage and radio contact with your headset microphone as well as our own surveillance team stationed at Site -███ nearby your location inside of SCP - 15629 . Please note that there are several hazards present within this structure; please watch your step at all times while exploring it and avoid touching anything unless otherwise instructed by us or yourself . If you do come into contact with an anomalous object or entity, please attempt to remain calm and report it immediately back to us via radio communication . Do you understand?<br><br><b>D-[REDACTED]: </b>Yeah yeah , I got it…Okay, I'm inside now…Oh god…oh god no..no no no no….I don't think I can go in there again..Please don't make me go in there again..please….Noooooo!

No wait maybe it'll helpme get out of here!! HELP ME PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!!!! [At this point D-[REDACTED] began screaming incoherently for several minutes before succumbing to fatal wounds inflicted by said entity.]<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>[To other researchers] Alright guys turn off the cameras for now; we've seen enough for one day .
