Unlike traditional zombies, however, these creatures possess an unusual cognitive capacity and are capable of complex thought.<br><br><i>SCP-20108</i>'s physical characteristics are similar to those of a human corpse; they appear emaciated and decayed with missing limbs or organs. Despite this, they exhibit an unnatural level of resilience and can survive in extreme environments where normal humans would not be able to survive.<br><br>The most notable trait exhibited by <i>SCP-20108</i> is their ability to think rationally and communicate with each other via vocalizations. They have been observed engaging in conversations about topics such as politics, philosophy and science, although the content is often nonsensical or incoherent. Additionally, some instances have been known to display rudimentary problem solving skills when presented with puzzles or challenges.<br><br>In order to prevent the spread of <i>SCP-20108</i> into populated areas it has been determined that containment procedures must include the destruction of all instances upon sight. In cases where this cannot be done safely then alternative measures may need to be taken such as relocation or quarantine protocols for affected areas until all instances have been eliminated.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-20108</i> is to be contained in a secure facility located at [REDACTED]. All personnel entering the facility must be equipped with appropriate protective gear and are to remain on alert for any sign of <i>SCP-20108</i> activity. Any sightings of <i>SCP-20108</i> must be reported immediately.<br><br>All instances of <i>SCP-20108</i> are to be terminated on sight, using whatever means necessary. In cases where this cannot be done safely then alternative measures may need to be taken such as relocation or quarantine protocols for affected areas until all instances have been eliminated.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20108.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of <i>SCP-20108</i> instances were observed engaging in what appeared to be an organized search for food. It is unknown if this behavior is common among the species or if it was simply a one-off occurrence.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20108.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-20108</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers conducted an interview with one instance of <i>SCP-20108</i>. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us anything about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20108</i>:</b> I am…nothing. I have no purpose, no will to live or die. I just exist in this world, waiting for something to happen.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you remember anything from before you became a zombie?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20108</i>:</b> I…I can't remember. It's all a blur. All I know is that something happened to me, and now I'm here.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20108.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to determine the extent of <i>SCP-20108</i>'s cognitive abilities. An instance of <i>SCP-20108</i> was presented with a Rubik's Cube and instructed to solve it. After approximately two hours, the instance had managed to solve the puzzle.</div>
