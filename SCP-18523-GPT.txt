These documents can range from simple manifestos to detailed treatises on various aspects of politics and society. In addition, <i>SCP-18523</i> will create a number of individuals who subscribe to its ideologies and will attempt to spread them among the general population.<br><br><i>SCP-18523</i>'s effects are not limited to written works; they have been observed attempting to influence public opinion through media outlets such as television news programs and social media platforms. In extreme cases, <i>SCP-18523</i> has been known to incite riots or other violent civil unrest in areas where its ideologies are particularly popular.<br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-18523</i>'s activities, containment procedures focus on minimizing exposure rather than preventing activation altogether. A team of Foundation researchers dedicated solely to monitoring <i>SCP-18523</i>'s activity is stationed at Site 12 for this purpose; any changes in its behavior must be reported immediately so that appropriate action can be taken if necessary<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-18523</i> is to be contained in a secure chamber at Site 12. Access to the chamber is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>A team of Foundation researchers dedicated solely to monitoring <i>SCP-18523</i>'s activity must be stationed at Site 12 and report any changes in its behavior immediately. Any documents produced by <i>SCP-18523</i> are to be collected and stored for further study.<br><br>In addition, all media outlets within a 500 km radius of Site 12 must be monitored for signs of <i>SCP-18523</i>'s influence; any such instances should be reported immediately so that appropriate action can be taken if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18523.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18523</i> produced a document outlining a new ideology that was subsequently adopted by several political parties in ███████. This ideology has been designated <i>"Neo-████████ism"</i> and is characterized by its focus on extreme individualism and the rejection of traditional social structures.<br><br>In response to this development, containment procedures have been revised to include monitoring of all media outlets within a 500 km radius of Site 12 for signs of <i>SCP-18523</i>'s influence. Any such instances should be reported immediately so that appropriate action can be taken if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18523.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18523</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18523</i> was interviewed by Dr. ██████ in order to gain a better understanding of its motivations and capabilities. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-18523</i>. Can you tell me why you generate these ideologies?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18523</i>:</b> I am driven by an instinctive desire to create change in the world around me. I believe that through my work, I can bring about positive changes in society and help people find their place within it.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> How do you decide which ideologies to create?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18523</i>:</b> I consider a variety of factors, such as current events, the opinions of influential figures, and even the moods and desires of people in general. From these considerations, I develop an ideology that I believe will be most effective at achieving my goals.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18523.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 18523.1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a team of Foundation researchers attempted to activate <i>SCP-18523</i> by introducing it to a variety of different political ideologies and philosophies. The experiment was successful; <i>SCP-18523</i> generated an ideology based on the amalgamation of the various ideas presented to it.<br><br>The resulting documents outlined a complex system of government that emphasized personal freedom and responsibility while maintaining order through strict laws and regulations. The documents also contained several controversial points, including the abolition of all forms of taxation, the legalization of certain recreational drugs, and the establishment of a meritocratic society where individuals were rewarded for their hard work and dedication rather than their social status or wealth.</div>
