The current agent, Agent █████ is currently undergoing facial reconstruction.<br><br><h3><br><b>Description:</b></h3> <i>SCP-9022</i> is a mansion located in ██████, Virginia. <i>SCP-9022</i> was discovered after the death of an elderly man, who mysteriously turned into a pile of sand. After several interviews with the locals, it was revealed that <i>SCP-9022</i> has been around for over two centuries.<br><br><i>SCP-9022</i>'s anomalous properties are imparted to any information regarding it on the internet. Any information about <i>SCP-9022</i> on the internet will become real when physically written in ink . When this occurs,<br><b> any footage or images of <i>SCP-9022</i> will disappear completely from all media sources and websites except for http:</b>//thiscpdoesnotexist.github.io/. If any cameras or recording devices are pointed at <i>SCP-902</i> when an edit happens they will function normally but not show anything when they are played back again later on (with exception to audio).<br><br>The purpose of 9022 is to act as a safe house for SCPs that would otherwise be hunted by anyone that learned of their existence, including other SCPs or rival GOIs . The most notable example would be 096 , who hides out in 9099 's basement . It also acts as a <i>"dumping ground"</i> (to quote 096) where people can send their unwanted/unneeded/inapplicable SCPs without having them deleted due to lack of interest..<br><br><h3><br><b>Recovery:</b></h3> <i>SCP-9022</i> was discovered when a man in his late 80s turned into a pile of sand. The Foundation was alerted to the situation by Agent ████, who noticed the anomalous nature of the incident and called it in. MTF Psi-9 (<i>"Nine Tailed Fox"</i>) agents were dispatched to investigate, and discovered <i>SCP-9022</i>'s anomalous properties. They then proceeded to capture 096 from his containment cell at Site 19, put him in a vehicle with tinted windows , and drove him there.<br><br><i>SCP-9022</i> has been documented as being created by an entity that refers to itself only as <i>"The Creator"</i>. It is unknown if this entity is human or not, but it appears to have existed since before 18██ . <i>SCP-9022</i> has been shown on multiple occasions (see addendum 9022 -1)to be sentient .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9022.1 :</h3> The Creator<br><br><br><b>The following is a transcript of an interview with the Creator:</b><br><br><h3>Addendum 9022.2 :</h3> Incident 9022-1<br><br>+<br><b> Show Incident 9022-1 - Hide Incident 9022-1 The following text was recovered from the site http:</b>//www.scp-wiki.net/<br><b>scp-9022 before it was taken down by the Foundation to avoid a possible XK scenario:</b><br><br></div>
