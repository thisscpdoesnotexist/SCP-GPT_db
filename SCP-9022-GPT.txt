It will not appear to anyone in groups larger than 4, and can only appear to someone who is alone for longer than 10 minutes. The person <i>SCP-9022</i> chooses will be brought back with it into its containment cell,<br> where they will be given a choice: either stay here or go free. If the victim chooses to stay there he/she will never age and if he/she leaves <i>SCP-9022</i> it can no longer find him/her and disappears completely.<br><br><i>SCP-9122</i> is a man that appears randomly at any location around the world, but always appears without warning or notice, coming from nowhere and disappearing just as quickly. He cannot be seen by people with low IQs (less than 75), nor can he see such people himself. He has been nicknamed <i>"The Invisible Man"</i> because of this trait of his appearance only being visible by those whom are intelligent enough to see him clearly whilst nobody else notices anything unusual around them at all . <i>SCP-9122</i> was first discovered following reports of strange disappearances coinciding with sightings of a 'mysterious man' spotted in various locations all over the planet for several weeks before disappearing again just as suddenly as when he appeared .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9122</i> was first discovered following a string of unexplained disappearances that were reported across the United Kingdom. A number of descriptions by those who had witnessed a 'strange man' in their vicinity before disappearing were compiled, and after several people had been reported missing from different locations all over the country, an undercover operation to locate this man was launched.<br><br>After <i>SCP-9122</i>'s identity as the responsible party behind these disappearances became apparent, he was located as he traveled through London on foot during broad daylight. The Foundation quickly set up a perimeter around him and began an interview with him under the guise of members of Scotland Yard . After explaining his anomalous properties to them and his motivations for causing these disappearances, <i>SCP-9122</i> agreed to be taken into custody and transported back to Site 19 for containment.<br><br><br>Interview: The following is a transcript from an interview conducted by Dr ██████ with <i>SCP-</i><br>9122 immediately following his capture:<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9022.1 :</h3> Interview with <i>SCP-9122</i><br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-</i><br>9122 Interviewer: Dr ██████<br> Foreword: This interview was conducted at Site 19, during which Dr ██████ attempted to gain information regarding <i>SCP-9122</i>'s origins and motivations. <Begin Log> Dr ██████: Hello, my name is Doctor ██████. I am here to ask you some questions about yourself. Would that be alright?<br><br><i>SCP-9122</i> nods in response.<br><br>Dr ██████: Ok then… I must say, you are very interesting looking to me. Are you human? Are you an alien? What are you exactly? What species do you belong to if not human or alien? (<i>SCP-9022</i> does not respond) You don't look like any other humans I've seen before, what makes you different from them exactly?<br><br>(<i>SCP-9022</i> remains silent for several minutes before responding.) <i>SCP-</i><br>9122 : No… No… Not human… Not an alien either… Those who found me said the same thing when they discovered me that day.. That their scientists thought I was just another missing person until they did more research into it and discovered what i actually am.. But only after the damage had already been done of course….. They knew after looking at my appearance closely…… But it was too late by then…… (Pauses for several seconds) After all this time…… It still hurts…… A lot…… All of them thinking im just another stupid little nobody…. Just a dumb kid who got lost in the forests one day and never came out again…. Nobody ever gave a damn as long as im out of their lives for good….. Just so long as they don't have to see me again or have anything else do with me ever again….. Well fuck them….. Fuck everybody!! Fuck humanity!! Fuck every last piece of shit person on this planet! They're all nothing but a bunch of worthless motherfuckers anyway!!! None of them deserve anything better then being left alone alone with their own misery once and for all!<br><br>(Pauses briefly)<br><br>I'd love if none of those useless fucks had noticed my existence after all these years but I know its never going happen now because Im stuck here with them now thanks to your guys' capture efforts thanks so much for doing that by the way even though im sure its gonna make things worse now thanks alot idiots maybe next time if your going try capturing someone whose been causing people disappearances since he first appeared on earth thousands upon thousands upon millions upon trillions upon zillions years ago maybe next time try capturing someone who can actually give a rat's ass about hurting people instead trying capturing someone who is hurt himself cause thats probably gonna end up making things worse somehow especially considering how many billion fucking years he has lived through already probably making him far more advanced than us so uh yeah sorry i guess im rambling on right now but uh yeah thank god we caught him before he could hurt<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9022.2 :</h3> Discovery of <i>SCP-9122</i>'s anomalous properties<br><br>[LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED] <h3><br>Addendum 9022.2 :</h3> Discovery of <i>SCP-9122</i>'s anomalous properties On █/█/████, during a routine checkup on the health and well being of <i>SCP-9122</i>, a team of medical personnel noticed that several anomalies regarding his body were observed. A full report was submitted to Dr ██████ who then requested to conduct an interview with <i>SCP-9022</i>. <Begin Log> Dr ██████: Alright then… I have been informed by my staff about your condition now…. Apparently you are suffering from some sort of abnormality….. Care to tell me more about it?<br><br><i>SCP-92</i> nods in response as he wipes away a tear from his face<br><br>Dr ██████: Something wrong?<br><br><i>SCP-92</i>: Yes.. I can't see myself anymore at all… Thats why im crying…… I can't really remember the last time i actually looked at my reflection in a mirror or anything like that…. All those years ago when i first discovered this ability i took advantage it and checked myself out every now and then just for fun but ever since i started disappearing whenever people look at me or trying to talk with them or something like that the only thing they see is an empty space where im standing instead…. It's creepy as fuck…..<br><br>Dr ██████: Perhaps you should try practicing more discretion if you want</div>
