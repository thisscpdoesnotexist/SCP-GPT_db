But you're different... You have my gratitude! Thank you! Thank yoouuuuuu!! [Dr. ██████ was pushed away by one of 15008's loyalists.] Ahh! My loyalist is being rude again! Please forgive him! He'll be punished later on... [The guard that pushed Dr.] Dr.: It's fine, just answer my questions please?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15009</i>: </b>Yes of course.. What would you like to know? Anything at all.. Ask anything of me.. And I will answer it with no hesitation whatsoever…. Ask anything…. Go ahead…. No need for hesitation at all….. Just ask….. Anything…… Just ask…… Go ahead…… Ask….. Meeee!!! [The guard that pushed Dr.] Dr.: The first question is about how were you created? How did the anomaly happen? Is there any way we can reverse its effects or stop it from spreading further? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15009</i>: </b>Ohhh yes.. That's what i wanted most of all!! To tell someone about myself and my friends here!! It seems that everyone wants us dead or gone but not many people want to talk with us and listen what we have say!!! So let me start from the beginning then!!!! Once upon a time there was a man named ███ who worked as an assistant in an office called ██ , he had no family nor friends but he didn't mind because he loved his job very much , then one day he met another man named ███ who also worked as an assistant in another office called ██ , they became best friends after talking with each other every day after work hours until they decided to quit their jobs and open their own business together which consisted on selling clothes made out of human skin!!!! They started making lots of money because their clothes were very popular among celebrities and rich people , however they weren't satisfied so they decided that if something sells well then why don't we sell humans themselves instead?! So they kidnapped some people from homeless shelters around town , killed them slowly by cutting them up into pieces which gave them enough blood for making more clothes!!! After selling those humans as well as their blood for several years now our two main characters started feeling bored so they decided it would be fun if something bad happened inside their building so everyone could see how cool they are!!! So one night when everyone went home our two main characters took two guards hostage (who were working late) put them inside a room full off explosives locked the door closed turned off the lights turned on loud music played hide n seek with each other until both guards died due to explosion caused by said explosives!!!! After doing such thing both main characters felt really happy because now everyone knows how cool they are!!!!! However soon after doing such thing our two main characters realized something terrible …everyone knew how cool they are but nobody liked them anymore!!!!! Everyone hated them even though those same people used buy stuff from them before!!!!! Everyone stopped buying things from our two main characters including celebrities and rich people whom loved buying things from those guys before!!!!!!!! Our two main characters tried everything possible in order get back into business again but nothing worked out …they tried killing random strangers on streets just hoping someone would care enough about murders happening around town just so maybe someone might buy stuff forme again but nooooooo nobody cared anymore even though murders happened every single day!!!! People kept going shopping everyday without caring whether anyone got murdered or not!!!!!!!! Even worse than this …people started hating those guys even more than before!!!!!!!! Our two main characters once loved by many became hated by everybody overnight without knowing why …they didn't do anything wrong except trying make money outta selling human flesh which isn't illegal anyway right??????

After he did so, the corpse started to glow and a new anomalous object appeared next to it. It seemed to be an exact replica of D-4582, except that it was made out of stone and had no anomalous properties. The replica disappeared after a few seconds.<br><br>Experiment #: 2<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15008</i>, D-1234 (SCP Foundation agent). Dr ██████ (former head researcher of Site 19). Agent ████████ (former guard at Site 19) and Drs ████ and █████████ were also present in the room during the experiment. All personnel involved were wearing hazmat suits as well as gas masks due to the possibility of contagious anomalies being created by SCP 15008's corpse . The room was sealed off from all other areas with reinforced steel walls that could only be opened from inside with Level 4 clearance or higher . This experiment took place in a different location than Experiment #1 due to security reasons . No one else but Drs ████ and █████████ entered or left the room during this experiment . All personnel involved were equipped with recording devices for further analysis purposes . A video camera was installed on top of the containment cell for observation purposes as well as security reasons . A microphone placed close enough for all personnel in the room to hear what is going on inside without being heard by anyone outside through audio surveillance equipment that can record sound waves up until 100 meters away from its source without any loss or distortion in quality , which is why everyone had their gas masks on at all times throughout this experiment , despite not being infected yet since they are not part of SCP 15008's loyalists yet , but they might become infected if they are exposed long enough after touching it even if they wear hazmat suits because its infectiousness cannot be stopped by any means known even though no one has been exposed long enough yet because there have been no further experiments done since this one due to fears that someone might get infected by touching it too much like how Agent ████████ became infected after touching it just once while wearing his hazmat suit so he could pick up its corpse afterwards for further experiments like these ones using him instead since he is immune against most anomalies created by other SCPs including SCPs related directly or indirectly with death since his job required him dealing with dead bodies every day before becoming an agent ) .<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b><i>"Hello? Can anyone hear me?"</i><br><br><b>Agent: </b><i>"Yes sir."</i><br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b><i>"Yes sir."</i><br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b><i>"Yes sir."</i><br><br>D - <br><br><b>1234: </b>Nothing audible can be heard through audio surveillance equipment placed near them except muffled speech coming from their gas masks which makes them hard to understand when listening carefully through audio surveillance equipment unless you are familiarized with their voices beforehand which is why I will only write down what I understood while listening carefully through audio surveillance equipment despite not understanding everything said by them because some parts were too muffled while others sounded distorted when listening closely through audio surveillance equipment but I will try my best describing what happened based on my understanding while writing down everything said between each other during this interview ) ~<s>D - 1234</s>~(translation)…It's hot…I'm tired…I need water…Can't we stop now? …Please? …No more testing? …Please! …My arm hurts! Please help me! ~<s>Dr - 1235</s>~(translation)…You're doing fine son! Don't give up now! Keep going until you die! That'll show those bastards who dared trying killing our leader! You're doing great son!! Don't give up!! ~<s>Agent</s>~(translation)….We're almost there boss.. Almost there.. Just keep going.. We'll take care of you once we get outta here.. But don't push yourself too hard alright? You're our leader but we still don't know how strong your powers are yet so let us do most of the work okay boss? We'll do whatever you say boss so please stay alive okay boss?! For us?! For your loyalists?! For our cause?! Please stay alive!! Stay alive!!! <s></s>End translation<s></s> [END</div>
