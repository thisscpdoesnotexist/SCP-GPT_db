An unknown force is transforming all non-crab organisms (including animals, plants, people) into crabs.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17046</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17046</i> is to be contained by a combination of physical and psychological containment measures.<br><br>Physically, all affected individuals are to be contained in specialized containment chambers designed to simulate the environment of their original species. All personnel entering these chambers must wear protective gear at all times.<br><br>Psychologically, affected individuals are to be administered daily doses of Class-A amnestics in order to prevent them from remembering their past lives as non-crab organisms. Affected individuals are also subject to weekly psychological evaluations in order to monitor for any signs of distress or abnormal behavior.<br><br>In addition, research into the cause and possible cures for <i>SCP-17046</i> is ongoing at Site ██. Any new information regarding <i>SCP-17046</i><br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17046</i> is an anomalous phenomenon affecting all non-crab organisms on Earth. All affected organisms are transformed into a species of crab, with no apparent rhyme or reason to the transformation.<br><br>The transformation is not limited to physical changes; affected organisms retain their memories and personalities, but exhibit behavior consistent with that of crabs. Affected individuals have been observed using tools, communicating in rudimentary language (usually consisting of clicks and whistles), and displaying complex social behaviors such as forming hierarchies and cooperating for collective tasks.<br><br>The cause of <i>SCP-17046</i> is unknown, though it appears to be spreading at an exponential rate. The only known way to halt the spread is through containment procedures outlined in Document 17046-A.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17046.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a task force was sent to investigate reports of anomalous activity in the town of [REDACTED], Maine. Upon arriving, they discovered that all non-crab organisms within a two mile radius had been transformed into crabs. The task force managed to contain the affected individuals and halt the spread of <i>SCP-17046</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17046.2 : </h3>Interview with <br>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Dr. ██████, head researcher on <i>SCP-17046</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>So, Doctor, what can you tell me about <i>SCP-17046</i>?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well, it's an anomalous phenomenon that is transforming all non-crab organisms into crabs. We don't know the cause yet, but we're working on it as best we can with the resources available to us.<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Do you have any theories as to why this is happening?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>It could be anything from a natural phenomenon to something more sinister and intentional in nature - we just don't know yet. We're still researching and gathering data in order to get a better understanding of what's going on here and hopefully find a way to stop it before it spreads further than it already has.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17046.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log <br><br><b>17046-1: </b>On ██/██/20██, a sample of affected individuals were subjected to various forms of physical and psychological testing in order to determine the extent of their transformation. Results indicated that the transformation was not reversible, and that affected individuals had adapted to their new forms with remarkable speed.</div>
