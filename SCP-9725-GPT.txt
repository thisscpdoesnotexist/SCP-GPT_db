When powered on, <i>SCP-9725</i> will display a loading screen identical to that of the Nintendo 64 game console. After loading is complete, <i>SCP-9725</i> will display an image of a controller with two buttons and an analog stick in place of the d-pad. The player can then choose between two games:<br><br>Game 1: A platformer reminiscent of Super Mario 64 , where the player controls a man named ██████ ██████████ (designated <i>SCP-9725</i>-1). If the player dies in this game, they will be teleported back to the title screen.

Game 2: A first person shooter reminiscent of Doom 64 , where players control one or more soldiers fighting against demons (designated as SCP 9726) wearing armor resembling those worn by characters from Doom . Players have access to weapons including chainguns and rocket launchers; however these are ineffective against most instances of 9726 due to their armor being resistant towards bullets and rockets respectively . It should also be noted that instances appear much faster than normal enemies do in other games within its genre . There are two known ways to kill <br><br><b>them: </b>either by damaging their helmet enough so that they receive damage through said helmet or by using explosives such as grenades or rockets which destroy any part not covered by armor . Due to these factors , players must utilize teamwork if they wish to survive long enough for extraction . Upon exiting this game , all saved data for it is deleted along with any progress made towards completing it . This deletion does not affect progress made within Game 1 upon returning there after playing Game 2 . The development team responsible for creating both games has been unable to explain why both are present on one cartridge despite being developed separately ; however if asked about how both were able gain sentience when played together , [REDACTED] stated that he had no idea what I was talking about before hanging up on me .<br><br>A first person shooter reminiscent of , where players control one or more soldiers fighting against demons (designated as 9726) wearing armor resembling those worn by characters from .

The researcher was injured but not killed in the attack, and was subsequently treated for his injuries. After this incident, <i>SCP-9725</i> has been reclassified as Euclid.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9725.2 : </h3>Interview with 【 LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED 】<br><br>+ Show Interview Log 9725-A - Hide Interview Log 9725-A <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-9725</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted shortly after the events of Addendum 9725.2, shortly before <i>SCP-9725</i> was reclassified as Euclid. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello there, would you like to tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9725</i>: </b>My name? I don't think I know my name… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well then how about we start with something simpler, where do you live? <i>SCP-9726</i> appears from behind a nearby wall and attacks the researcher . The researcher is injured but not killed in the attack . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Fuck! What are you doing here!? <i>SCP-9726</i> moves towards the researcher but is shot by security personnel . The researcher is treated for his injuries . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this incident it became clear that both games on <i>SCP-9725</i> were sentient and hostile towards Foundation personnel; however if asked about how both were able gain sentience when played together [REDACTED] stated that he had no idea what I was talking about before hanging up on me again . Due to this new information , testing with <i>SCP-9725</i> has been suspended indefinitely until a way can be found to contain it safely or destroy it without harming any research staff within its vicinity .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9725.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 9725-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9725-01, a 29 year old male of European descent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9725 was instructed to play Game 1 for 5 minutes. After this time had elapsed, he was asked to describe his experience within the game. He reported that he played as <i>"some guy who looked like me"</i> and said that there were <i>"monsters"</i> in the game which he had to avoid or defeat in order to progress through it . When asked about how these monsters appeared , D-9725 described them as being similar looking to those from Doom but with different colors . He also claimed that they were able to move faster than normal enemies would be able . This is consistent with what other players have reported after playing Game 2 . After 5 minutes of gameplay, D-9725 was instructed not to play any further until the end of testing. At this point , <i>SCP-9725</i>'s screen turned black for approximately 15 seconds before returning back into its normal state. When questioned about what happened during this period , D-972 stated that all he saw was a loading screen and then nothing else happened until the screen returned into its normal state when testing resumed .<br><br></div>
