No personnel are allowed to read any part of <i>SCP-15367</i> aloud, and all testing must be approved by the current project head .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15367</i> is a collection of one hundred and twenty-two (122) handwritten notebooks, each with a different title. The majority of titles are in Russian, but there are also several in English. All books contain the same text:<br><br><i>SCP-15367</i> was discovered on ██/██/19██ at the [REDACTED] Library in [REDACTED], Russia. A librarian reported that a man had come into the library and left 122 identical notebooks behind before leaving quickly. The librarian collected all of them and brought them to Site-19 for storage. When they were opened, it was found that each notebook contained the same text as <i>SCP-15367</i>.<br><br>When an individual reads any part of <i>SCP-15367</i> aloud, they will begin to experience vivid hallucinations over time, which will become more detailed over time until they become completely indistinguishable from reality after approximately two (2) weeks. These hallucinations can be anything from seeing objects or people who aren't actually there to experiencing events that never happened or have not yet happened . These hallucinations can be suppressed by taking amnestics . However, if an individual's consciousness is ever exposed to any part of <i>SCP-15367</i> again after being suppressed , it will begin manifesting again immediately . This effect does not seem to depend on whether or not an individual has read SCP 15367 aloud before; subjects who have only read it silently still experienced these effects when exposed again later on .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15367.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15367</i>-2, who has been identified as █████ ██████, a librarian at the [REDACTED] Library. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15367</i> was brought to Site-19 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello, Mr. ██████. I'm going to be asking you some questions about the notebooks that you found on your library's premises recently . <br><br><b><i>SCP-15367</i>-2: </b>(Shakes head) I don't know anything about any notebooks or why they were there . What are you talking about? Dr. ███: We found 122 notebooks with the exact same text in them at your library's premises . They say that they were left by a man who came in and left quickly afterwards . We're trying to find him so we can ask him some questions regarding these books and their origins . (<i>SCP-15367</i>-2 remains silent.) Dr. ███: Are you still there? SCP - 15367 - 2: Yes… but I don't know what this is all about… (SCP - 15367 - 2 pauses for several seconds.) You said that someone had left these notes here? Who was it exactly? Did he leave any contact information or anything like that ? Dr. ███: Unfortunately not; he seemed to have disappeared before anyone could get his name or figure out where he went off to… We were hoping that maybe one of your employees might have seen something suspicious around then , but no one seems to remember seeing anything unusual happening then either… Do you remember seeing anyone suspicious around then ? Or maybe someone who looked out of place ? (SCP - 15 367 - 2 remains silent.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview, it became clear that ████████ did not read any part of SCP - 15 367 aloud himself , as he did not experience any hallucinations when exposed again later on during testing ; however , his consciousness was exposed indirectly through Agent Kondraki reading aloud from another copy of the book during testing before being suppressed by amnestics once more , which caused him to start experiencing hallucinations again immediately after exposure occurred . It is currently unknown whether or not an individual must read all parts of SCP - 15 367 aloud themselves for its effects to manifest fully in them; however, it is hypothesized that this may be true due both to the fact that only one person has ever been affected by reading parts of SCP – 15 367 aloud directly and also because Agent Kondraki experienced similar effects from reading other copies even though only parts had been read aloud directly from those copies previously .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15367.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 1: D-5392 was placed in a room with <i>SCP-15367</i> and told to read aloud the first page of the notebook <i>"<i>SCP-15367</i>-1"</i> . D-5392 did so, and reported seeing nothing unusual.<br><br>Experiment 2: D-5392 was given a second copy of <i>SCP-15367</i>, titled <i>"<i>SCP-15367</i> -2"</i>, and told to read aloud from it instead. After reading aloud for approximately two (2) minutes, D - 5392 began to experience hallucinations , which became more intense over time. At this point, Dr. ████████ instructed him to stop reading; however, he continued reading for another three (3) hours before being removed from the room by security personnel . Upon removal , his hallucinations ceased immediately. He was administered amnestics and released back into containment after questioning .<br><br>Experiment 3: A copy of SCP 15367 titled <i>"SCP 1536 7"</i> was created using an exact replica of SCP 15 367's text written on a standard computer keyboard using Microsoft Word program. When read aloud by Dr ████ ██████████ , he experienced mild auditory hallucinations which were not recorded in detail due to their lack of severity compared with previous experiments . However when questioned about what he experienced later on he stated that as soon as he had finished reading the document out loud his vision began blurring until eventually all vision had disappeared completely . He then said that at this point something seemed to be holding him down against his will but despite struggling violently for approximately ten (10) minutes no one could be seen or heard in the room before suddenly regaining visual function once again along with full mobility shortly afterwords although experiencing light nausea for several hours afterwards but stated that there were no other noticeable side effects apart from occasional mild headaches over the next few days when questioned about these symptoms during interviews following this experiment they declined comment stating that they felt no ill effects whatsoever since recovering from them and therefore assumed they were caused by stress or anxiety rather than any physical cause although refused further comment on this subject during future interviews afterword s</div>
