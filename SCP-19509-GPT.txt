The bones are in a state of constant motion and animate on their own accord. They appear to have no form or structure, instead constantly shifting and re-arranging themselves into different shapes.<br><br>The bones show signs of extreme age, but the exact date of death is unknown. It appears that the remains were preserved through some unknown means, as they do not show any signs of decay or deterioration despite their age.<br><br>When exposed to direct sunlight, <i>SCP-19509</i> will become active and begin moving around in an erratic manner while emitting a low humming noise that increases in volume as it moves closer to living organisms. When this happens it will attempt to make contact with them using its various body parts (i.e., arms, legs). If contact is made then the subject will experience intense pain followed by paralysis for up to several minutes before returning back to normal.<br><br>In addition, when exposed to strong emotions such as fear or anger <i>SCP-19509</i> will become more aggressive in its behavior towards living beings attempting physical contact with it; often resulting in severe injury if not stopped quickly enough by personnel trained for such occurrences<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-19509</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with a light source that can be activated and deactivated remotely, as well as soundproofing materials to reduce the noise emitted by <i>SCP-19509</i> when it is active. Personnel are not allowed to enter the containment chamber unless absolutely necessary, and then only with proper protective gear.<br><br>Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective clothing such as gloves, masks, and goggles to prevent contact with <i>SCP-19509</i>'s body parts. In addition, personnel should avoid making direct eye contact or engaging in any physical contact with <i>SCP-19509</i> while inside the containment chamber. Any personnel who do make physical contact with <i>SCP-19</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 19509.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-19509</i> was found in a cemetery near [REDACTED], France.
