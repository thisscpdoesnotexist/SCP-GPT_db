It is composed of four verses and a chorus, each with its own distinct melody. The lyrics of the song express feelings of sadness and loss associated with heartbreak.<br><br>The song has been observed to have an effect on those who listen to it, causing them to feel emotionally overwhelmed and encouraged to cry or otherwise display their emotions in some way. This effect appears to be stronger when the listener has recently experienced heartbreak themselves.<br><br>The song itself does not appear to be anomalous in any way; however, it has been noted that playing <i>SCP-17188</i> at a volume higher than normal will cause listeners within earshot to become more emotional than they would normally be while listening. This effect increases as the volume increases until reaching maximum intensity at approximately 130 decibels. At this level, individuals affected by <i>SCP-17188</i> will begin weeping uncontrollably regardless of whether or not they are currently experiencing heartbreak themselves.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17188</i> is to be stored in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17188</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-17188</i> is played at a volume greater than 80 decibels, all personnel within earshot must be administered Class B amnestics and monitored for any further emotional distress.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17188.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a request was made to test the effect of <i>SCP-17188</i> on a group of individuals who had recently experienced heartbreak. The test was conducted in an isolated chamber with no other sound sources present. All personnel involved were administered Class B amnestics prior to entering the chamber and monitored for any emotional distress during the duration of the test.<br><br>The results showed that all personnel affected by <i>SCP-17188</i> began weeping uncontrollably within minutes after it began playing, regardless of their previous emotional state. This effect persisted even after <i>SCP-17188</i> had been stopped, with some individuals continuing to cry for up to two hours afterwards.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17188.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17188</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation researcher conducted an interview with <i>SCP-17188</i>. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17188</i>. Can you tell me about yourself? <br><b><br><i>SCP-17188</i>:</b> I'm a song about heartbreak. It's my purpose to make people feel what it's like to have their hearts broken and help them cope with the pain that comes along with it. <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> How do you achieve this? <br><b><br><i>SCP-17188</i>:</b> By expressing feelings of sadness and loss through lyrics and melody. When someone listens to me, they can relate to what I'm saying and understand how they're feeling. <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Do you have any other effects on those who listen to you? <br><b><br><i>SCP-17188</i>:</b> Yes, when someone listens to me at a loud volume, they become overwhelmed with emotion and can't help but cry or show their emotions in some way. It's like I'm giving them permission to let go of the pain and start healing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17188.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #:</b> 17188-1<br><b>Subject:</b> D-17188-1<br><b>Procedure:</b> D-17188-1 was instructed to listen to <i>SCP-17188</i> at a volume of 80 decibels.<br><b>Results:</b> Upon hearing the song, D-17188-1 began to cry and express feelings of sadness and loss associated with heartbreak.
