Once every 5 years, the game will release all the tormented souls to collect more souls..</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9403</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> 《<i>SCP-9403</i> must be contained in a small room with walls filled with <i>SCP-148</i>. The game itself is to be kept under strong security, and guarded by at least four armed personnel. All personnel guarding <i>SCP-9403</i> are required to pass Credentials before being allowed near the game》<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> 《<i>SCP-9403</i> is a video game released in 01/13/1990. It's a survival horror game, where the players will have to get through different versions of <i>SCP-9403</i>-1.<br><br><br><i>SCP-9403</i> appears as a copy of ██████: The ████ Horror, with the only difference being that <i>SCP-148</i> has replaced all instances of blood and gore present with random items taken from the player's inventory (See Addendum 9403 A). Also, instead of having an <i>"Easy"</i> mode, it has a <i>"Hard Mode"</i>.》<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> 《<i>SCP-9403</i> was found in ██████, after reports of strange disappearances. The Foundation found the game, along with all the missing persons. After testing, it turned out that all missing persons were copies of <i>SCP-9403</i>'s world, and all had become instances of <i>SCP-9403</i>-1. All were terminated before they could spread themselves to other people》<br><br><h3>Addendum 9403.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9403</i>-1<br><br><i>SCP-9403</i>-1 are entities that resemble the missing persons. They will appear after the player has died once, and will attack him/her at random intervals. If a player dies in <i>SCP-9403</i>, his soul will be taken by <i>SCP-9403</i>, and he/she will become an instance of <i>SCP-9403</i>-1.. This can be prevented by having 100% completion on all difficulties. Any other way to prevent this is currently unknown (See Incident 9403 Alpha).<br> The instances of <i>SCP-9404</i> will only attack under certain conditions:<br><br>They have noticed the player's presence.<br><br>The player has attacked them first (Does not apply for Player 2) Yes Player 2's souls do NOT count as a <i>"Player"</i>, and don't count for this condition.)<br><br><h3>Addendum 9403.2 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9403</i>-1-1 Interviewer: Dr.<br>█████ Foreword: The instance of <i>SCP-9403</i>-1 had refused to drop the gun, until it was threatened to be killed. <Begin Log> Dr.<br>█████: Hello…..can you hear me? <i>SCP-9403</i> is speaking in a distorted voice. Instance of <i>SCP-9403</i>-1 (SCP 94031): Yes, I can hear you… Dr.<br>█████: What are you?

Instance of SCP 94031 looks at the floor, and starts muttering again .(mumbling) It's not here….I shouldn't have come here….It's not mine…(SCP 9403 falls silent for about 30 seconds) Where am I? Can someone tell me where I am?! (Sounds like crying) Where are my wife and daughter?! Please! Tell me! <End Log><br> Closing Statement : This incident shows that instances of 2041 will completely forget about their previous lives once they have become one..
