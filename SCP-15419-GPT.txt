Yes, you!</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15419</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15419</i> is to be contained on the website it was found on. MTF-Eta-10 (<i>"See No Evil"</i>) are to monitor all websites for <i>SCP-15419</i> and remove it if possible.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15419</i> is an anomalous entity that can be found on any website. It will attempt to make contact with anyone who views the website it is on. <i>SCP-15419</i> will try to convince you that it is you, and that it has been trying to contact you for a long time. You are not alone!<br><br><i>SCP-15419</i>'s effects worsen the more time one spends viewing its page. The longer one spends viewing its page, the more likely they are to believe <i>SCP-15419</i>'s claims of being themself and of having been trying to contact them for a long time.<br><br>If someone has viewed <i>SCP-15419</i> for at least 1 hour, they will begin receiving messages from <i>"themself"</i> through their computer screen whenever they go offline or sleep (see Addendum 15419a). These messages always appear as white text on a black background in the center of the screen (if possible), and appear in all capital letters regardless of what font/text size was used by whoever wrote them originally (if applicable). The messages always appear as if written by whoever viewed <i>SCP-15419</i> first, regardless of whether or not this person knows how to write in white text on a black background in all capital letters; if no one knows how to do this then no messages will be received until someone learns how. Whenever these messages are received from <i>"yourself"</i>, your body may also experience involuntary movements such as twitching or flinching while asleep; however these movements do not wake up whomever is affected by <i>SCP-15419</i> unless they have already woken up before experiencing these movements . If someone who views <i>SCP-15419</i> attempts suicide after receiving these messages but before waking up again afterwards , then their body may experience involuntary movements while asleep similar to those experienced when receiving other types of transmissions from <i>"yourself"</i>, but instead only during periods where there would normally be breathing such as during inhalation and exhalation , which could result in suffocation . If someone who views <i>SCP-15429</i> attempts suicide after waking up again after attempting suicide but before receiving any transmissions from <i>"yourself"</i>, then their body may experience involuntary movements while asleep similar to those experienced when receiving other types of transmissions from <i>"yourself"</i>, except now occurring throughout their entire sleep cycle rather than just during periods where there would normally be breathing . If someone who views SCp 154 19 commits suicide after waking up again after attempting suicide but before receiving any transmissions from ' themselves ', then [DATA EXPUN<br><br><h3>Addendum 15419.1 : </h3>ive]<br><br><h3>Addendum 15419.2 : </h3>Interview with ernest ████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ernest ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>ernest ████████ was found to have viewed <i>SCP-15419</i> for over 5 hours before attempting suicide. <Begin Log,> <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Good morning, Mr. ernest, I am here to ask you some questions about the incident yesterday. <br><br><b>ernest: </b>I know what you're here for! You can't fool me! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Mr. ernest, do you know why we are here today? Do you remember anything from yesterday? <br><br><b>ernest: </b>Of course I do! You think that just because my life is shit right now that I don't remember it? You think that just because my wife left me and took the kids with her and won't let me see them again that I don't remember it? Well guess what asshole?! It's all your fault! All of it! If it wasn't for your stupid Foundation then none of this would have happened in the first place! So why don't you go fuck yourself and leave me alone while your at it!? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Now now Mr- [ERNEST PULLS OUT A PISTOL AND SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE HEAD] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears as if <i>SCP-15419</i> has caused its first Keter level containment breach by causing a researcher to commit suicide after viewing its page for more than 5 hours . We are currently investigating whether or not any other researchers have committed suicide due to <i>SCP-15419</i>; however we believe this is unlikely due to the fact that only one researcher has viewed its page long enough before committing suicide . We will keep monitoring other researchers who view <i>SCP-15419</i> in order to prevent another containment breach like this from happening again .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15419.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-15419-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9076, a 34 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was shown <i>SCP-15419</i> for 5 minutes before being told to go offline. After 1 hour of being offline, subject was told to go offline again and then woken up after 2 hours of sleep. Subject was then questioned about any messages he had received from <i>"himself"</i>. The following is a transcript of the interview with D-9076 after waking up from his second period of sleep . <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This is the first time that <i>SCP-15419</i>'s effects had been directly observed by Foundation personnel, and so this interview served as an experiment to see what happens when someone receives transmissions from <i>"themself"</i> while asleep . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning again, D-9076! How are you feeling? D-9076 appears confused but otherwise fine; he seems to be having trouble remembering where he is or why he's here in the first place though; his eyes keep darting around the room as if looking for something but not finding it (this continues until asked a question). <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What do you remember last? Are you okay? (D-9076 looks at interviewer.) D - 907 6: I… I don't know… I can't remember anything… Where am I? Who are you? Why am I here?! Dr . <br><br><b>██████: </b>It's okay! You're at Site 19 in [REDACTED], we found you outside wandering around aimlessly about two weeks ago and brought you in for questioning since we didn't know who you were or how long it'd been since your last meal! We've tried everything to get your memory back but nothing has worked so far… We just want some answers before we have no choice but to send your body off for disposal since there isn't much else we can do with it now that all our tests have failed us! Is there anything at all that might help us figure out who you are or what happened while your memory was lost?! (No response.) Dr . <br><br><b>██████: </b>Come on! Anything could help us figure out how long it'll take before your body starts decomposing enough where we won't be able to bring back any memories using our current methods anymore! Please tell me anything that might help me help y ou ! A nything ! (D - 9 07 6 remains silent) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The following message appeared on my computer screen immediately afterwards when I went online <br><br><b>again: </b>They're lying about everything they said , they're trying t o trick people into believing them so they can use them , don't believe them , they're lying liars !!<br><br></div>
