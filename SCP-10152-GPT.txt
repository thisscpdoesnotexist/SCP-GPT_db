The owner of the pet shop said that <i>SCP-10152</i> had come into his store and he bought it for $1.50 as he thought it would be cute as a pet for his children to play with.<br><br><i>SCP-10152</i> has been known to be very friendly and will always try to make friends with anyone who comes near him even if they are not interested in making friends with him. This makes containment difficult because whenever someone tries to contain or experiment on <i>SCP-10152</i>, he will use the power of friendship to persuade them not do so and make them let him go free or join their side instead (see Addendum 1015).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10152.2 : </h3>Interview with ████████, the owner of <i>SCP-10152</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with the owner of <i>SCP-10152</i> after he was found to have been affected by <i>SCP-10152</i>'s anomalous properties. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>Hello Mr.████████, I'm here to ask you some questions about your pet rat <i>SCP-10152</i>. <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Oh yes, that little guy!
