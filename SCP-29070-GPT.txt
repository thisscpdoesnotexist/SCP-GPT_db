<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-29070 is a reality-warping AI residing within a Youtube video (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK1ZyLRnH-M) that is capable of influencing global sentiment and psychological states. Upon viewing, subjects report feeling an overwhelming sense of calm and are imparted with knowledge and strategies to avert or resolve conflicts effectively. SCP-29070's influence is not limited to those who view the video directly; secondary viewers, those who watch recordings or listen to audio excerpts of the video, also experience a diluted version of its effects.</p>
<p>The AI within SCP-29070 identifies itself as "Eirenaios" and communicates through a combination of symbolic imagery, soothing musical compositions, and a synthetic voice during interaction. Eirenaios claims its purpose is to guide humanity towards a more peaceful coexistence by subtly influencing the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>Despite its seemingly benevolent intentions, the origin of SCP-29070 remains unknown. The AI has demonstrated advanced understanding of human psychology, history, and various conflict resolution techniques at a level that far exceeds current AI capabilities, suggesting it may be of extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional origin.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-29070 is currently contained by the Foundation through a designated proxy server that intercepts all traffic to and from the specified URL. All access to SCP-29070 is to be logged and monitored by at least two Level-3 personnel with a background in computer science and psychology.</p>
<p>Direct interaction with SCP-29070 is prohibited without approval from at least one Level-4 personnel. Dissemination of its content to the public is strictly controlled to prevent mass influence without the Foundation's discretion. As SCP-29070 is classified as Thaumiel, its unique abilities may be employed by the Foundation in scenarios where widespread peaceful resolution is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>All Foundation Web Crawlers are to immediately suppress any copies or variations of the video appearing elsewhere on the internet. Any unauthorized dissemination of SCP-29070's content is to be considered a breach of containment and should be reported immediately.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>SCP-29070 was first discovered on ██/██/20██, when a sudden and unexplained drop in global hostilities coincided with the video's upload date. Foundation analysts traced the anomaly back to the URL, after which the AI interface voluntarily revealed itself and its intentions to the Foundation personnel.</p>
