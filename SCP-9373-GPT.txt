Anything that moves towards <i>SCP-9373</i> is to be fired upon immediately by guards.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9373</i> is a humanoid that moves at speeds of up to ███ km/h and its screams will cause any human hearing it to pass out. It was discovered on ██/██/████, when several reports from the city stated there was a child roaming the streets causing citizens to fall unconscious. <i>SCP-9373</i> has not displayed any other anomalous properties but is still extremely dangerous due to its extreme speed and destructive screams.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9373</i> was discovered on ██/██/████ when it caused █ casualties. It was unable to be pursued as it could move too fast. The Foundation contacted local law enforcement and ordered them to set up a blockade at the entrance of <i>SCP-9373</i>'s house. When <i>SCP-9373</i> appeared the police opened fire, and after 5 minutes of constant firing they managed to subdue <i>SCP-9373</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9373.1 :</h3> Testing<br><br>Test A - ██/██/████<br><br><br>Subject: <i>SCP-9373</i>, D-class personnel. Camera feed inside the testing room.<br> Procedure: D-class personnel would walk towards <i>SCP-9373</i>.<br> Result: As soon as the D-class approached <i>SCP-9373</i>, <i>SCP-9373</i> moved towards them at an incredible speed and caused the test to be halted.<br> Notes: It appears that it responds to any movement within a certain radius of it. - Dr ██████ Test B - ██/██/<br>████ Subject: <i>SCP-9373</i> Procedure: .<br> Result: .<br> Notes: It seems that no matter how much damage is inflicted on its body it will always recover from any wounds made within ten (10) minutes of receiving said wounds and return to normal condition for another ten minutes before reopening its wounds again unless given specific treatment for said injuries by a medical doctor or Foundation doctors trained in treating anomalies such as 94327 who are authorized by O5 command to treat this anomaly only with 93734 in order not to cause a containment breach resulting in possible death of site staff due to its destructive screams which can still kill unless both ears are covered with ear muffs or other sound proof material preventing subjects from hearing its screams resulting in death (see addendum 9371). There is also a possibility that if subject is deaf they won't die but suffer severe brain damage instead due to overloading of the brain due to extreme amounts of information being transferred through their auditory nerves into their brains causing permanent damage leading to mental retardation and loss of sapience making them more like animals than humans leaving them unable have communication skills leaving them incapable of speech as well as making physical contact with others impossible unless accompanied by sign language or other forms of non verbal communication such as writing notes which leaves many people unable able communicate effectively without resorting using sign language which can lead others who cannot understand sign language feeling left out when conversing with those who can thus leading them feeling unhappy about themselves because they feel like they're not part of society anymore because they feel alone since everyone else seems so much better off than them now because those deafened by 93734 don't seem human anymore nor do they belong anywhere anymore because there's no place where someone like him could fit in so he becomes very socially awkward around those around him since he feels so different now thus He becomes reliant on friends and family members whom are willing work together enabling each other fit into society again after being released from his care under supervision until he gets better then once he does begin recovery process once again learning how use computers and phones etcetera bringing him back up learning skills necessary for living life outside hospital wards allowing him become productive member society again helping others less fortunate than himself regain their ability communicate effectively enough so now become contributing member community reintegrating seamlessly back into society becoming equal members community next opened door opportunity given returning suitably qualified person ready take his place should happen something unfortunate happen occur during rehabilitation process giving<br><br><h3>Addendum 9373.2 :</h3> Incident Report<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-9373</i> escaped from containment after several guards were killed by it.
