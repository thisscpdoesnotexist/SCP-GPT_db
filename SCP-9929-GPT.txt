And why did you come into existence?<br><br>SCP - <br><br><b>9930: </b>Well let's see…I was created by a man named Hans █████████ who was working for the Nazi party during world war 2 as an engineer and scientist , he created me because he wanted to use my power as a weapon against the allies but unfortunately due to circumstances beyond his control he never got that chance . After world war 2 ended I was found by some of his relatives who were also working for the Nazi party but they didn't know what I really was so they decided to keep me hidden from other people until one day when an earthquake happened and damaged my legs beyond repair which made it impossible for me move on my own . The relatives then decided that it would be best if they just left me there since no one would ever find out about what happened here and so now here we are . Oh yeah before i forget , can i ask something ? Why am i being kept in this room all alone ? It's rather boring in here …and lonely too…can't we at least have some company ? Please …I don't want to stay here any longer…i'm begging you…let someone else come in this room with us …please….i'm sorry if i said anything wrong or rude….please forgive me……..just please let someone else come inside….please…..(The rest of this log consists of SCP - 9930 crying )<br><br><h3>Addendum 9929.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Experimenter: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9929</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dr. ██████ was to ask <i>SCP-9929</i> various questions about it's life and how it came to be in the facility.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-9929</i> refused to answer any questions and requested that the experiment be terminated immediately.
