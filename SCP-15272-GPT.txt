How did they get bad? D-15272 begins to cry softly as he speaks next several minutes are spent with him sobbing before he can speak again without crying heavily between words) (D - 15 272 continues): We had just gotten done fighting off a bunch of those big black slugs when suddenly the lights went out and everyone started screaming and panicking! (D - 15 272 pauses here for several seconds before continuing.): It turned out that someone had accidentally deleted our save file while trying to make a new character on their own computer! (D - 15 272 pauses here again briefly as he tries his best not to break down into tears once more.): The game wouldn't let us restore it either because we didn't have permissions so everyone just sorta freaked out until somebody found an admin password lying around on one of the computers in there! They used it to log into our server control panel thingy and tried restoring our save file but they couldn't because someone else had already deleted it! Then things got worse really fast when someone said that they saw something moving outside through one of the windows while everyone else kept freaking out about their characters being gone! So me being me I decided I'd go check it out since no one else would even though most people told me not too because they thought whatever was outside might still be able to get inside somehow through a window or something, but I didn't listen because if nobody goes then nothing gets done right? So anyways after checking around outside for a bit with my flashlight turned off so nothing could see me coming from far away or anything like that; which is why nobody noticed what happened next until later on after everything calmed down again; anyway eventually i found what looked like some kind of hole dug under one side of our building near where the hole thingies are supposed keep anything big enough from getting inside through them if anyone remembers them being put up there back during construction last year; only its weird is how none of those holes ever showed up on any blueprints or plans or anything like that even though they're supposed be part o fthe original design according to everybody who worked on building this place back then before we moved in here last year sometime; anyways i guess whoever dug this hole must have been using shovels instead digging by hand since its pretty deep considering how long its been since anybody checked those holes over last time which means whoever did this probably planned ahead somehow knowing exactly where these holes would show up even though no blueprints ever showed them existing anywhere except for right where these ones ended up showing up once construction finished back in January sometime last year; anyways i went inside thinking maybe whoever made this hole might still be hiding somewhere nearby hoping no one would notice them missing yet but i never found anybody inside except for an old man sitting against a wall just staring at his hands which looked kinda weird seeing how his arms weren't moving at all compared most peoples arms do whenever you look at them move around especially when people talk sometimes unless its cold outside whenever peoples arms tend freeze stiff whenever its cold enough outside making peoples skin feel hard & brittle too almost feeling like plastic sometimes too depending upon temperature & humidity levels wherever your located whenever winter hits plus wind chill makes matters worse too making skin feel stiffer than normal due mainly due frostbite setting in faster than normal making skin harder than normal resulting mostly due sub zero temperatures combined with wind chills below minus ten<br><br><h3>Addendum 15272.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+Experiment 15272-1 -Hide Experiment 15272-1 Experiment 15272-1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-8320<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-8320 is to play <i>SCP-15272</i> for 1 hour.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After playing for approximately 45 minutes, D-8320 began to complain of severe headaches and nausea. When asked about the game, D-8320 described it as <i>"unusually realistic"</i>. When questioned about how he could tell, he reported that <i>"things were moving in the corner of my eye."</i> He also reported seeing shadows move around him when there was no light source present. At this point, Dr. ██████ told him to stop playing and escorted him out of the testing room.<br><br>+Experiment 15272-2 -Hide Experiment 15272-2 Experiment 15272-2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Dr. L███ (Level 3 Researcher)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dr. L███ is to play <i>SCP-15272</i> for 1 hour while being monitored by security cameras and Foundation AI Eta 7328 (<i>"Theta"</i>). A microphone will be placed on his person in order to monitor his speech at all times during gameplay. The microphone will be connected directly into a recording device set up in a separate room from where Dr.[REDACTED] will be playing SCP-[REDACTED]. The recording device has been modified so that any sounds produced by [DATA EXPUNGED] cannot escape into the outside world or vice versa through any means other than direct physical contact with [DATA EXPUNGED]. All testing was performed at Site-[REDACTED] on █/██/████ . All personnel involved with this experiment were under Level 3 security clearance or higher except for Eta 7328 which was granted Level 4 clearance specifically for this test due to its unique nature as an artificial intelligence program capable of self awareness and sapience . An additional microphone has been installed in front of the computer used by [REDACTED]. Security personnel are stationed within observation distance of both microphones during testing should anything occur which requires their attention . No other precautions are necessary due to nature of SCP-[REDACTED] being unable to communicate verbally through any means besides direct physical contact with another sapient organism . Due note that if said precautions prove insufficient then it is recommended that all further experiments involving [DATA EXPUNGED] be postponed until such time as new procedures can be developed . In addition , all recordings from experiment are not allowed outside access without approval from O5 command due note possible cognitohazardous effects caused by exposure hearing certain phrases used repeatedly throughout these logs , please refer addendum section regarding these effects before proceeding further read more…</div>
