The chamber is to be guarded by two (2) armed guards at all times, and any personnel entering the chamber are not allowed to use the internet for more than 10 minutes.<br><br><i>SCP-15435</i>'s containment chamber is to be kept under 24 hour surveillance by security cameras, with the footage being monitored at all times. Any attempts by <i>SCP-15435</i> to breach containment are to be met with immediate termination of all personnel in the area and a full site lock down until <i>SCP-15435</i> can be recontained.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15435</i> is the internet. It was discovered in ██/██/20██ when a user on 4chan posted a picture of <i>SCP-15435</i>. The user had no memory of taking the picture, and all attempts to find the original thread have been unsuccessful.<br><br><i>SCP-15435</i>'s effects manifest after a person has used the internet for at least 10 minutes. This causes them to lose their memories every time they use it, but not before remembering that they lost their memories every time they use it, which causes them to become depressed and suicidal as a result. This also causes users to be unable to remember how much time has passed since they last used the internet, making it impossible for them to know if using it again will cause more memory loss or not (see addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15435.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ███████, who has been affected by <i>SCP-15435</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This is the first successful interview with a victim of <i>SCP-15435</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello Mr. ███████, how are you today? <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Not good, I can't remember shit from before I started using the internet. <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Can you tell me why you used it in the first place? <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Uh…I think it was to uh…get some information about something or other? I don't know what though, my memories are all fucked up now that I think about it… Dr. █████ pauses for several moments before speaking again <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Do you remember anything else about that day?

Subject had been using the internet for at least 10 minutes before the experiment.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15435 was told to use the internet for an additional 10 minutes. After this time had passed, he was asked what his name is and what year it is. He replied with <i>"I don't know"</i>. He was then informed of his name and year, which caused him to become very distressed as he could not remember them himself. After this, he was told to use the internet again for 15 minutes more. Afterwards, he was asked what his name is and what year it is again, but replied with <i>"I don't know"</i> once more. The test ended here as D-15435 became too distressed to continue answering questions after this point (see addendum).<br><br>Experiment #: 15435-2<br><br>Subject(s): D-15435's sister (name withheld), a female aged 23 who has never used the internet before in her life due to being raised by religious parents who believed that it would corrupt her mind and soul until she died from using it too much. She has been isolated from society since birth due to her parents' beliefs that she would be corrupted by society if they let her go outside their house ever again after she turned 18 years old (the age where they believe children should be allowed out into society). She had never seen or heard of <i>SCP-15435</i> before this experiment took place. She just thought that there were some sort of strange black box on all computer monitors in existence until now when we showed her one during this experiment so that we could show her how <i>SCP-15435</i> works without exposing any other staff members or civilians working here at Site 19 or any of our other sites around the world who have no knowledge about <i>SCP-15436</i> either because they are new employees still training under us or because they are part of another foundation branch located somewhere else around the world not connected with us in anyway shape or form like Site 17 located in ██████ Mexico which we have no connection with whatsoever despite both sites having similar goals but different ways of achieving them like ours does so please stop asking me why I'm saying all these things right now because I'm just repeating myself over and over again while typing out these words right now which are meaningless garbage clogging up my brain making me feel like I'm going insane even though I really am going insane right now as you can see by reading through my words on your screen right now even though you probably can't see anything written down on your screen at all instead seeing nothing but random letters typed out onto your screen randomly appearing out nowhere appearing randomly disappearing randomly reappearing randomly everywhere at once instead making you think that everything happening inside your head must be real since you can only see random letters appearing on a blank white background rather than seeing nothing at all nothingness emptiness meaninglessness meaninglessness emptiness meaninglessness everything everywhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nothingness everything everywhere everywhere everywhere there's something wrong with my head something wrong inside my brain something wrong inside my body something wrong within myself something wrong within me there's something wrong within me i feel sick i feel ill i feel nauseous i feel sickeningly ill feeling sick feeling ill feeling nauseous feeling sickeningly ill nauseatingly ill sickness sickness vomiting nausea nausea sickness nausea vomiting sickness vomiting illness illness illness illness vomit vomit vomit vomit puke puke puke puke barf barf barf barf throw up throw up throw up throw up retch retch retch retch gagging gagging gagging gagging gag gag gag gag die die die die death death death death dead dead dead dead black box black box black box black box empty shell empty shell empty shell empty void void void void<br><br></div>
