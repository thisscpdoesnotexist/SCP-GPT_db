The castle was once owned by a wealthy noble family, but after the death of the last member, it has been abandoned.<br><br><i>SCP-10356</i> is home to a large population of immortal creatures and humanoids. These creatures are referred to as <i>SCP-10356</i>-1. <i>SCP-10356</i> was discovered by MTF Epsilon 11 (“The Unseen”) after reports of strange activity coming from the area were reported by local civilians and police officers. After further investigation into these reports, MTF Epsilon 11 found that there were several disappearances in the area over a period of 3 years before discovery . The disappearances were not investigated due to lack of evidence or witnesses . Upon investigation into these disappearances , MTF Epsilon 11 found that all missing people had been transported to <i>SCP-10356</i> through unknown means . All missing people have since died within 24 hours after being transported , with no cause for death being found in any autopsy . It is believed that they have died from starvation or dehydration as there are no signs of violence on their bodies upon autopsy .<br><br>Upon entering <i>SCP-10356</i> , all personnel will be greeted by several humanoid figures who appear to be dressed as medieval knights and guardsmen wearing armor made out of human bone and metal scraps (see Addendum 10356/A). These entities will then escort personnel inside the castle where they will meet with other humanoid figures who appear to be dressed like medieval lords, ladies and servants (see Addendum 10356/B). All humanoid figures encountered within <i>SCP-10356</i> speak modern English without an accent despite originating from different time periods throughout history. All humanoid figures encountered within <i>SCP-10357</i> show no hostility towards any personnel unless provoked first or if given orders otherwise by O5 command staff or site director level staff members. Humanoid figure encounters vary depending on which entrance is used into SCP - 10 356 ; however, there are some commonalities between each encounter:<br><br>All humanoid figure encounters begin with one entity greeting them at the entrance way; this entity will then lead them through corridors until reaching a large room where more entities greet them inside; this room appears similar across all entrances except for minor differences like size and decorating style; most rooms also contain tables filled with food ranging from fruits , vegetables , meats including bones , breads , pastries etc.; tables also contain cups filled with drinkable liquids ranging from water , wine etc.; all<br><br><h3>Addendum 10356.1 : </h3>~<s>This is a test log to see if the <i>SCP-10356</i> entities can be interviewed.</s>~<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10356</i>-1-2 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after initial contact with the castle's inhabitants . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr. ██████ . I am here to ask you some questions about yourselves and your home . SCP - 10 356 - 1 - 2: Please , call me James . I shall answer any questions that you may have for me . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then, James , what are your duties? SCP - 10 356 - 1 - 2: My duty is to protect this castle from intruders and keep it safe for everyone who lives within its walls; I also serve as an advisor to our king when he needs advice on important matters of state or war strategies against our enemies in other kingdoms nearby us; there are many others who serve under him as well but they all have different jobs that they do within the castle such as cooking , cleaning , guarding the walls etc.; we all work together so that we can live peacefully here in this beautiful place where we have lived since time began and will continue living until time ends ; however, there are times when people decide to leave this place because they get bored of being immortal or just want a change of scenery so they venture out into other lands where others like them live until their bodies eventually die off from old age or sicknesses like cancer or heart disease ; these people come back here after death just like all of us did before them; but sometimes people come back here with new ideas about how things should be run within our kingdom which causes conflict between us sometimes leading to fights between those who support these new ideas and those who don't which leads into civil wars between groups inside our kingdom over certain issues ; but no matter what happens among us , we always manage to resolve these issues without having any casualties among ourselves unlike outside kingdoms where battles often result in death due to violence inflicted by weapons made out of metal which causes bleeding wounds leading into infections and eventually death unless treated with medicine made out of herbs grown around the area by farmers working on their fields growing crops such as wheat , corn etc.; most kingdoms outside ours do not have access to modern medicine because their lands are usually barren due lack of water needed for farming thus causing mass starvation among peasants living in these areas causing them either die off from hunger or move into more fertile areas nearby looking for food elsewhere resulting in overcrowding problems which cause many peasants dying off from diseases spreading through crowded cities making it harder for doctors practicing modern medicine (if available) treat patients effectively resulting in more deaths than cures being given per patient; even if modern medical treatments were available, most peasants would not be able find treatment due lack of money needed pay doctors fees making it impossible for poor peasants living under feudal government systems (such as Feudal Japan ) receive proper medical care leading towards high mortality rates among peasant populations compared with royalty class populations living under monarchies (such as Ancient Egypt ); however, since most feudal governments rely heavily on agriculture production provided by peasants working on fields growing crops like wheat corn etc., royal families often help lower class populations survive famine years by providing food rations during times when crop yields fall below average levels allowing lower class population survive long enough until next crop season begins preventing mass starvation deaths among peasant populations unlike monarchies ruled by kings/queens who tend ignore lower class population suffering during famine years unless forced intervene otherwise risking losing popular support during elections held every 4 years forcing them step down crowns/thrones leading towards rebellion against monarchy system itself resulting overthrow monarchies ruling nations turning countries democratic republics instead electing leaders based upon popular vote instead hereditary succession passed down generations through family lines ; anyway… getting sidetracked there… sorry about that… anyways… back onto topic now! So yes ! We do fight amongst each other sometimes over certain issues but nothing serious really ! We always manage resolve conflicts peacefully without having any casualties! All disputes are settled peacefully! No one ever dies fighting over disagreements! It’s quite amazing really ! Do you know how hard it is maintain peace throughout centuries ? It’s very difficult indeed ! But somehow we managed pull through despite differences amongst ourselves keeping peace throughout centuries across multiple generations despite changes occurring throughout history affecting society at large changing social norms affecting culture impacting political structures altering economic policies resh</div>
