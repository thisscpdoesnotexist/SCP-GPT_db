The enclosure is to be equipped with multiple cameras and microphones connected to a central monitoring station manned 24/7 by no fewer than 3 Level 3 personnel . Instances are to be fed live prey twice daily and may only leave the enclosure for testing purposes. Any personnel who have consumed <i>SCP-11433</i> must report for testing immediately after consuming any amount of <i>SCP-11433</i>.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11433</i> is a glass jar of fresh honey produced by bees of the Apis mellifera species. The label on the jar indicates that it was produced in ████████, Greece.<br><br><i>SCP-11433</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when any human subject consumes at least 1 kg of <i>SCP-11433</i>. Subjects who consume <i>SCP-11433</i> will experience an increase in their overall happiness and well-being, with this effect increasing proportionally to the amount consumed. In addition, subjects who have consumed <i>SCP-11433</i> will become increasingly resistant to negative emotions such as anger and sadness, instead experiencing them as positive emotions such as joy and pride respectively.<br><br>Subjects who consume 2 kg or more of <i>SCP-11433</i> will begin to exhibit minor physiological <br><br><b>changes: </b>ears may begin growing larger than normal; eyes may be replaced by large black orbs; fingernails may grow into sharp claws; skin coloration may become pale green with dark spots; teeth may be replaced by fangs or tusks; hair coloration becomes white and/or gray; noses are replaced by snouts containing multiple nostrils capable of detecting smells from kilometers away (see Addendum 11433a); subjects' height will increase up to 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) tall for males, 3 meters (9 ft 10 in) tall for females; weight increases up to 250 kg (550 lb); muscle mass increases dramatically causing subjects' body fat percentage to decrease significantly below average levels for humans. All changes are fully reversible if subject ceases consuming <i>SCP-11433</i> at any time before reaching 4 kg total consumption. Subjects who have reached 4 kg total consumption are designated instances of <i>SCP-11434</i> and must be terminated immediately due to their extreme hostility towards human beings . Instances of SCP - 11434 have been observed communicating using a combination of vocalizations resembling those made by various predatory animals , human speech , hand gestures , and scent marking . To date there has been no successful method discovered for communication with instances other than through these methods . Instances also possess several abilities not possessed by humans including superhuman strength , speed , agility , reflexes , coordination , endurance ; telepathic communication ; teleportation ; [REDACTED] . Due to the extreme danger posed by instances they should only be contained at Site ██ where they can be kept under surveillance until termination can take place . See Document 11434a for details on containment procedures .<br><br><h3>Addendum 11433.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Note: </b>All testing involving <i>SCP-11433</i> was halted in 19██ after it was discovered that consuming 4 kg of <i>SCP-11433</i> caused subjects to become instances of <i>SCP-11434</i>. After this discovery, the only remaining sample of <i>SCP-11433</i> was removed from storage and disposed of.</div>
