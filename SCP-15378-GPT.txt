Any personnel who have read any part of <i>SCP-15378</i> are to be immediately transferred to another site and monitored for signs of infection.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15378</i> is a collection of three paperback novels, collectively titled <i>"The Lost City of the Monkey God"</i>. The books are written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, published in 2002 by Grand Central Publishing.<br><br><i>SCP-15378</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual has read at least one of the books in its entirety. After this point, if any member of the individual's family or close friends have also read any part of <i>SCP-15378</i>, they will become affected as well.<br><br>The affected individuals will begin to believe that there is a city in Honduras called La Ciudad Blanca (<i>"the White City"</i>) which is inhabited by sapient white monkeys and contains vast quantities of gold. They will seek to travel to La Ciudad Blanca as soon as possible; if they cannot travel directly there, they will attempt to reach it through other means (e.g., purchasing land or air time in Honduras). Affected individuals who do not have access to sufficient funds for such purposes may resort to theft or violence; on several occasions these actions have been successful enough for the individuals involved that they were able to make their way into Honduras and continue their journey towards La Ciudad Blanca . Once inside the country, most affected individuals attempt to make their way into remote areas where it is believed that La Ciudad Blanca lies; however, no such area has ever been found .<br><br>Once an affected individual reaches an area within approximately 100 km from where they believe La Ciudad Blanca exists , they enter what can be described as a state similar to hibernation . During this period , all bodily functions cease except for respiration ; heartbeat slows down dramatically , reaching approximately 10 beats per minute after several days . This state lasts until death occurs due either from starvation or dehydration ; however , some subjects have survived up two weeks without food or water before finally dying . Autopsies performed on corpses recovered from this state show significant brain damage caused by cerebral hypoxia during hibernation ; however , no other internal changes are present except for mild dehydration . It should be noted that none of these effects appear outside <i>SCP-15378</i>'s influence — neither animal testing nor observation has shown any signs similar symptoms occurring independently when exposed only through reading <i>SCP-15378</i> without having had it recommended by someone else first.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15378.1 : </h3>【ACCESS RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 3 PERSONNEL AND ABOVE】<br><br>Experiment Log 15378-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-6483, a 27 year old male of Hispanic descent. Subject has a history of petty crime and drug use. Prior to testing, the subject was given a copy of <i>SCP-15378</i> and instructed to read it.

It should be noted that although no other subjects have displayed symptoms as severe as those exhibited by D - 64 83 , all subjects who have read at least one part of SCP - 1 5 378 display similar symptoms following its removal — including crying and an inability to describe how they feel after its removal (see Experiment Log 15378 - 2 ). Further testing with Class B amnestics shows that these effects are permanent once SCP - 1 5 378 has been removed from their possession ; however , no other side effects appear when amnestics are administered before or during exposure ( see Experiment Logs 1537 8 - 3 through 1 537 8 7 ).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15378.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 3 PERSONNEL AND ABOVE】<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-6391 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-6391 is a 27 year old male of Hispanic descent.
