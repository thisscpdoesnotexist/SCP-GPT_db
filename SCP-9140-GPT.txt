After being attacked by <i>SCP-</i>███, Agent ████ fled into an adjacent room and accidentally activated a button that opened the door to the room next to him, which contained <i>SCP-940</i>.<br><br>SCP 940 is not real and should not be confused with [DATA EXPUNGED] from [REDACTED] at [DATA EXPUNGED] or any other random songs<br><br><h3>Addendum 9140.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-940</i> Testing Log<br><br><br>Experiment 940-1:<br><br><br>Subject: <i>SCP-940</i>.<br><br><br>Procedure: Research Assistant ████████ plays <i>SCP-940</i> for D-918, who has been instructed to listen until the song ends. D-918 is then questioned about his opinion of the song and asked if he would like to hear it again. After giving permission, D-918 is informed that he will be moved to another room if he asks again. This process repeats for up to five times with a different subject each time; at no time does any subject make more than one request to hear the song again (see Experiment 940-2). Subjects are then interviewed as per Experiment 940-3.<br><br><br>Results: All subjects showed strong signs of displeasure after hearing SCP -940 once; all requested not to hear the song again and those who were offered a second play declined by saying they did not want <i>"that noise"</i> in their ears anymore, despite being told it was a new test by Research Assistant ████████ and not the same person who played it before them. Notable results included instances of nausea, vomiting and two subjects breaking down in tears over what they described as <i>"the most horrible thing [they had] ever heard"</i>. After several minutes had passed without an instance of vomiting or crying from any subject listening through headphones, Research Assistant ████████ reported that all four listeners were <i>"calmly sitting back waiting for further instructions."</i> Attempts were made at this stage by Researcher Dr M█████████ from outside SCP -940's chamber via intercom but none of the four seemed able unconsciously reach out for a receiver even when there was clearly someone on intercom calling their names . Finally after 60 minutes Researcher Dr M████████ approached one subject personally resulting in him jumping up screaming at her before collapsing into tears on seeing her . It should be noted that only male subjects have been used as test subjects due to an apparent heightened sensitivity female test subjects show towards SCP -940 which is thought may be related to endocrine differences within certain brain structures . Further research is needed into this mechanism .<br><br>Experiment 940 – 2 : Three additional tests carried out using female volunteers with similar results obtained confirming previous findings regarding gender factors affecting perception of auditory stimuli (see Experiment 940 – 3 )<br> however partial transcript available below :<br><br><br>Test 1 : R A – 5151 Subject exhibits extreme revulsion immediately upon beginning play , requests cessation experiment , refuses interview stating she cannot bear thinking about what she just heard < End Transcript ><br><br><br>Test 2 : R A – 2788 Subject exhibits slight disquiet upon beginning play but quickly becomes visibly relaxed ; appears highly amused throughout listening experience , requests cessation experiment after three songs have been played states she finds music fascinating , declines interview stating she needs some fresh air < End Transcript ><br><br><br>Test 3 : R A – 6542 Subject exhibits mild irritation upon beginning play but quickly becomes visibly relaxed<br><br><h3>Addendum 9140.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-940</i> Test Log<br><br><br>Experiment 940 - 3: Two additional tests carried out using male and female volunteers with similar results obtained ,<br> partial transcript below : Transcript of Experiment 940 - 1 : < Begin Tape ><br> Researcher Dr M█████████: Hello D - 578 , how are you feeling today ?<br> D - 578: I'm feeling pretty good doc .<br> Researcher Dr M█████████: Good to hear .
