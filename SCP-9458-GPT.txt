Ƒ9458’s containment chamber is to have one (1) door, which should not be locked. No security measures are necessary, as any physical containment of Ƒ9458 would only result in him being transported to another location by <i>SCP-9458</i>’s properties.<br><br>All personnel working with or around Ƒ9458 are required to keep a dream diary and report any dreams they have had within the previous thirty six hours upon entering shift duty with or around Ƒ9458. Any individual having had a dream involving themselves or the site they are on must immediately report this information upon entering duty and will not be allowed anywhere near 9458 due to the potential for spontaneous transportation . Individuals who experience more than three (3) such dreams during their stay working with/around 9458 must immediately notify their supervisor and undergo psychiatric evaluation for possible memetic contamination.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9458</i> is a Caucasian male, 38 years of age, 173.3 cm in height and 88.5 kg in weight. No anomalous properties are apparent with the exception of an individual’s interaction with Ƒ9458 shortly after they wake up from a dream involving themselves and another location (designated as <i>SCP-9458</i>-1).<br><br><i>SCP-9458</i> was discovered when Agent Thurman, upon entering <i>SCP-</i>████’s containment chamber to do routine cell maintenance on 04/09/20██ had an unexpected encounter with Ƒ9458. Thurman reports being awoken by whistling coming from within his own containment chamber before noticing a man standing behind him within his own cell. Thurman claims that this man walked around the corner and appeared to “appear out of nowhere” . After confirming that the figure did not belong there, Agent Thurman took out his sidearm and ordered the man to remain still while he called for backup; however before he could finish dialing 9 or 1 , the figure vanished from sight entirely . A subsequent investigation revealed that there was no trace of any individual having been within 9458's containment chamber at any point except for security camera footage showing nothing unusual happening during that time frame other than Agent Thurman walking into view upon waking up . Follow up interviews with several Site personnel who had previously worked on site where Ƒ9458 was discovered (Site ██) revealed similar reports involving encounters with individuals believed to be Ƒ9458 after waking up from dreams occurring during their stay at Site ██ , however it is currently unknown if they were all referring to the same entity or multiple ones as more extensive interviews were unable to take place due to [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> Ƒ9458 was recovered from a psychiatric facility in ██████, California after several individuals who had been working at the facility reported seeing Ƒ9458 within their dreams. The patients involved were currently believed to be undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and were subsequently transferred to Site-██ for containment and amnesticization .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9458.1 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br>The following log was conducted between Ƒ9458 and Dr. ██████████, who at the time of the interview had been assigned to Site-██ after having worked at Site ██ .

Can you tell me anything about that?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9458</i>: Oh sure thing Doc! Whatever I can do to help out! Sorry if I'm being a bit slow here but it's hard for me remember since most of my memories are from people who were dreaming while they were inside these walls … so things might be a little fuzzy around the edges… (laughs) …or in this case in an area too close by that darned corner , hahaha !!
