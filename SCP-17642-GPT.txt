The wearer's heart rate is perpetually fixed to the dial's setting, regardless of all external influence, emotions, or injury.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17642<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17642</i> is a stopwatch with a small dial, measuring approximately 7.5 cm in diameter. The watch has no visible markings or brand name and appears to be made of brass and steel components.<br><br>When worn by a human subject, <i>SCP-17642</i> will cause their heart rate to match the setting of the dial on the watch. This effect persists regardless of external influence, emotions or injury; however, it can be temporarily overridden by deliberately changing the dial's setting.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17642</i> are not limited to humans; any living creature wearing the object will experience its anomalous properties as long as they remain conscious and alive.<br><br>Testing has shown that subjects wearing <i>SCP-17642</i> become increasingly agitated if their heart rate is set too low for an extended period of time, leading some researchers to theorize that this may have been intentional on part of its creator(s).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17642</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to the object is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any testing involving <i>SCP-17642</i> must be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 personnel and supervised by a medical professional. All subjects involved in testing must be monitored for any adverse effects of the object's anomalous properties.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17642.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17642</i> on non-human subjects. A juvenile chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was fitted with the object and monitored for any changes in behavior or physiology.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After wearing <i>SCP-17642</i> for one hour, the chimpanzee's heart rate had decreased significantly, indicating that it had adapted to the slower setting of the dial. The subject appeared unharmed by this change and showed no signs of distress or discomfort.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17642.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><br>Dr. ████ was interviewed in regards to <i>SCP-17642</i>'s anomalous properties and possible origin. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us anything about <i>SCP-17642</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> I'm afraid not, I don't know who made it or why they did so, but it seems to be a very powerful object with some kind of purpose behind its creation.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you think it was made for some kind of medical purpose?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> It's possible, but I'm not sure. The effects are certainly interesting and could be medically beneficial in some cases, but the fact that it affects any living creature suggests that its use may have been more widespread than just medical applications.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17642.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17642-1:</b><br><b>Subject:</b> D-8578, a human male in good physical health.<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to wear <i>SCP-17642</i> and set the dial to 10 beats per minute (bpm). Subject's heart rate was monitored for one hour.<br><b>Results:</b> Subject's heart rate remained at 10 bpm throughout the entire experiment. At the end of the hour, subject reported feeling lightheaded and dizzy but otherwise unharmed.</div>
