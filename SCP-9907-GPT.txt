<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9907</i> is a woman able to eat anything made of metal</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9907</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9907</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██ with a bed, toilet, sink, and shower. She is to be given 3 meals a day made out of food that can not be eaten by <i>SCP-9907</i> such as: bread, pasta, rice, meat (if it's cooked), vegetables (if they are cooked or raw), fruit (if it's cooked or raw), and water. She must also have access to a television set with cable so she can watch TV shows and movies while eating her meals.<br><br><i>SCP-9907</i> is allowed to have one hour of free time everyday where she can walk around Site-██ but must stay within the boundaries of Site-██ during this time<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9907</i> is a woman of unknown age, ethnicity, and weight. Her hair is brown and her eyes are green. She has been seen wearing different clothing depending on the time of day. <i>SCP-9907</i> will not talk to anyone unless she needs food or water.<br><br><i>SCP-9907</i> was discovered in ████████, Ukraine when reports of a woman eating metal were reported to the Foundation by local authorities. The Foundation sent Agent ██████ to investigate these reports where he found <i>SCP-9907</i> eating a steel fence post outside of an abandoned house that had been condemned for over 6 years at the time. Agent ██████ approached <i>SCP-9907</i> and asked what she was doing, causing her to drop the post and run away screaming <i>"I'm sorry!"</i> in Russian before being captured by Agent ██████ with no resistance from her part.<br><br><i>SCP-9907</i>'s anomalous properties manifest whenever she sees any form of metal that can be eaten such as: silverware, coins, nails (if they are small enough), or any other object made out of metal that can fit into someone's mouth without causing harm if swallowed whole with no chewing involved (see Addendum 99051). When this happens she will immediately attempt to eat it regardless if there are people around or not until it is gone or taken away from her somehow (See Addendum 99051). If an object made out of metal comes into contact with another object made out of metal while inside <i>SCP-9907</i>'s stomach then both objects will fuse together creating one solid piece until all pieces have fused completely together (See Experiment Logs). If more than one piece touches another piece at once then all pieces touching each other will fuse together creating multiple solid pieces instead of just one solid piece like in Experiment Logs below but still only one big mass instead two big masses like in Experiment Logs below (See Experiment Logs). The amount depends on how many pieces touch each other at once but there must be at least two touching each other for this effect to take place even if they touch each other for less than 1 second because as soon as they come into contact with each other they start fusing together right away even if it takes them longer than 1 second before actually fusing completely together which means that only 2 pieces can fuse together per every second because after 2 seconds pass by then all remaining uneaten parts stop touching each other making them unable to fuse anymore so those parts become separate again<br><br><h3>Addendum 9907.2 : </h3>Interview with ????<br><br>The following is an interview with <i>SCP-9907</i>. The interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ on ██/██/20██<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr. ██████ and I will be asking you a few questions today so please answer them as best as you can okay? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9907</i>: </b>Okay <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What's your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9907</i>: </b>My name is ???? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Do you know why you're here? <i>SCP-9907</i> nods her head yes <br><br><b><i>SCP-9907</i>: </b>I'm here because I ate the fence post outside of that house in Ukraine and they said that it was against the law to do that so they brought me here for punishment but what did I do wrong?! It wasn't like anyone saw me do it! It was late at night when no one was around! Why did they have to bring me here?! Why couldn't they just arrest me or something?! This isn't fair! They didn't give me a lawyer or anything! I didn't even get a trial before being sent here!! How am I supposed to get out of this place if no one will listen to my side of the story!? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please calm down and let us help you… [<i>SCP-9907</i> begins crying] Please stop crying… [<i>SCP-9907</i> continues crying] We'll try our best to get you out of this place soon okay?
