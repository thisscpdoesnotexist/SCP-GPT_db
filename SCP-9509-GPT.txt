Requests for additional amnestics are to be submitted to Dr. Renard.<br><br><i>SCP-9509</i>'s former containment procedures have been redacted, but are available in the archives under Document 9509/A, which should be reviewed at least once a month by all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-9509</i>.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9509</i> is a series of anomalous procedures for producing amnestics.<br><br><i>SCP-9509</i>-1 is a set of instructions for producing amnestics, which produces tainted versions of the products. The instructions were discovered in the office of Dr. ████████, an administrator at Site 19, who was using them in an attempt to repair <i>SCP-</i>████ and <i>SCP-</i>███, both of which had been damaged during containment breach on 12/15/1950 (see Incident Report 9509/A). Attempts to replicate these results have been unsuccessful.<br><br>The remaining procedures are copies that have been found in research notes belonging to Dr. ██████████ (see Document 9509/B), as well as several classified documents produced by a number of Foundation researchers over the years (see Documents 9509/C through -G). It remains unclear whether these researchers discovered <i>SCP-9509</i> independently or whether they obtained their knowledge from other sources . It is not currently possible to determine what percentage of Foundation amnestics may be contaminated by <i>SCP-9509</i>'s effects; however, past testing has indicated that this number may be significant . Research into countermeasures against it are underway;<br> see Addendum 2: Nonanomalous Amnestic Rebuilding Procedures for details on current efforts and progress towards developing countermeasures against it outside nonanomalous context . For more information on current contamination levels and associated containment breaches related to <i>SCP-9509</i> ,<br> please consult Document 9999: Containment Status Report on Incomplete Amnesic Countermeasure Processes, which will be updated monthly until such time as uncontaminated amnestics can be produced or until additional research has clarified how widespread contamination levels are within the Foundation itself . This document will also track all known instances where knowledge from documents containing portions or all instances of SCP - <br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9509</i> was discovered after several incidents involving contaminated amnestics were discovered. The first incident began on 06/02/1956, when a containment breach of <i>SCP-</i>███ in Site 19 led to the death of Dr. ████████ and several other personnel (see Incident Report 9509/C). As a result, Site 19 was temporarily shut down while it was investigated and staff received treatment with nonanomalous amnestics. However, Dr. ████████'s notes were found in her office during this investigation; they were confiscated by Agent █████ before further action could be taken (see Interview 9509-1).<br><br>The second incident occurred on 11/20/1962; see Incident Report 9509/D for details . This led to an investigation that uncovered additional documentation related to <i>SCP-9509</i> (see Document 9509/E).<br> This event also resulted in the creation of Document 999999: Containment Status Report on In<br><br><h3>Addendum 9509.1 :</h3> Selected Documentation<br><br>Document 9509/A: Containment Procedures for Euclid-Class Object <i>SCP-9509</i>.<br><br>These procedures were removed from the site administrator's office during a sweep by MTF Mu-83 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>) after Incident 9509/C was discovered. The accompanying documents are copies of these procedures and other documents found in the same office (see Document 9509/B). They are presented here without redaction in order to preserve their original form, which may be useful in future research efforts into <i>SCP-9509</i> (<br>see Addendum 2: Nonanomalous Amnestic Rebuilding Procedures).<br><br><br>Document Summary: Extended excerpts from Dr. ████████'s notes documenting her work on recreating amnestics tainted by <i>SCP-9509</i>, as well as correspondence with O5 personnel and several Foundation researchers, particularly Drs. ██████████ and █████ . Also included is an original copy of Document XXXX/O5 that was recovered from Site 19's records office; it has been translated into English . See document for full content . For more information on current contamination levels ,<br> please consult Document 999999: Containment Status Report on Incomplete Amnesic Countermeasure Processes , which will be updated monthly until such time as uncontaminated amnestics can be produced or until additional research has clarified how widespread contamination levels are within the Foundation itself .

She was using it in an attempt to rebuild amnestics that had been contaminated by something she called <i>"<i>SCP-9509</i>."</i> Researchers (Dr.) [REDACTED]: We've already talked with everyone else who was involved in this mess; do we really have to go through this again? Agent (Dr.) [REDACTED]: Yes, you do. As far as we can tell, people have been using these procedures since at least 1952 without realizing what they were doing or what their effects might be , and there's a good chance some of you still don't know . I want everyone involved to understand exactly how dangerous these procedures are before anything like this happens again . Researchers (Dr.) [REDACTED]: Fine… but if we're going to talk about this all over again, then I want everything you've got on any possible connection between your <i>"<i>SCP-9509</i>"</i> and ours; I'm not going into detail on something that's already classified higher than</div>
