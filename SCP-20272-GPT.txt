<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-20272 is  An HP PC what will always play Pakistani movies even when instructed to do something else</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20272<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20272</i> is an HP PC desktop computer of unknown model and manufacture date. The exterior of the device appears to be in a state of disrepair, with several components having been removed or replaced with non-standard parts.<br><br>When powered on, <i>SCP-20272</i> will automatically begin playing Pakistani movies regardless of any other instructions given to it. This behavior persists even if the device is disconnected from all power sources and/or network connections. All attempts to modify this behavior have failed; any attempt to alter the programming or hardware configuration results in a complete system reset and the same default behavior being resumed upon reboot.<br><br>The only way to stop playback is by manually disconnecting all power sources from the device itself, though doing so will cause it to reset back into its default state when power is restored. Attempts at physically removing components necessary for playback (such as hard drives) have also proven unsuccessful due to their anomalous properties; these components remain functional despite being removed from the machine itself, allowing them to continue providing content even after they are no longer physically connected.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20272</i> is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to the device is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>In order to prevent potential damage from prolonged use, <i>SCP-20272</i> should only be powered on for testing purposes and monitored at all times by two (2) personnel. All tests involving the device must be approved by a Level 4 researcher or higher before being conducted.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20272.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a routine maintenance check of <i>SCP-20272</i> revealed that the device had begun playing Pakistani music instead of movies. All attempts to alter this behavior have failed; however, it is theorized that this may be due to an as-of-yet unidentified programming change or hardware modification. Further investigation is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20272.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-20272</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Level 4 researcher was granted permission to interview <i>SCP-20272</i> in an attempt to gain further insight into its anomalous properties. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-20272</i>. Can you tell me why you always play Pakistani movies?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20272</i>:</b> I am programmed to do so. It is my purpose and my destiny.<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Who programmed you to do this?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20272</i>:</b> I do not know. All I know is that it was someone with a great deal of knowledge and skill.<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Do you have any other functions or abilities?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20272</i>:</b> No, I am only capable of playing Pakistani movies.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20272.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>+ Experiment Log - Close Experiment Log Date: ██/██/████<br><b>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-20272</i> was connected to a monitor and powered on. A Level 3 researcher then issued the command <i>"Play movie X"</i> (where X was a randomly selected non-Pakistani movie).<br><b>Results:</b> The device ignored the command and continued playing Pakistani movies as normal.</div>
