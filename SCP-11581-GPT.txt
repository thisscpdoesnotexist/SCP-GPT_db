No personnel are allowed to listen to music within earshot of <i>SCP-11581</i> for more than five (5) minutes at a time, and any personnel who do so are not allowed to listen again until they have been cleared by the medical staff.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11581</i> is a haunted guitar pick. It was found in the possession of ████ █████, who had been missing for over three years before he was discovered dead in his home with <i>SCP-11581</i> clutched tightly in his hand.<br><br><i>SCP-11581</i> causes all music played by the holder to be haunted by an entity which is only audible to those within earshot of the music. This entity has been referred to as <i>"The Music Man"</i> and has been described as having a deep voice, sounding similar to that of an old man, and being loud enough for those near the holder of <i>SCP-11581</i> to hear but not loud enough for anyone outside of earshot to hear it. The Music Man's voice constantly sings along with whatever song is being played by whoever holds <i>SCP-11581</i>, regardless if they are singing or not. The lyrics sung by The Music Man are always nonsensical and often contain references that make no sense at all within context of the song they are sung during (examples <br><br><b>include: </b><i>"I'm gonna eat you like spaghetti!"</i>, <i>"I'm gonna make sandwiches outta your face!"</i>, <i>"You're so delicious I could just eat you up!"</i>). It should be noted that no matter what language any particular person hears The Music Man speak in, everyone else will still hear him speaking English.<br><br>The lyrics sung by The Music Man will always match whatever language is used when describing it; if someone were to describe it as speaking German then all others would also hear it speak German even if they do not understand German themselves (this effect extends even past death). If there are multiple people listening then each individual will only hear their own interpretation of what he says; however this does not extend past death and therefore cannot be used as a form of communication after death unless another person can listen without hearing anything themselves (which has yet to happen).<br><br>If anyone listens long enough then one can begin hearing other voices singing along with The Music Man's voice which sound exactly like their own voices but distorted beyond recognition; these voices seem unaware that they are singing along with something else entirely and continue doing so until either something interrupts them or until something stops playing music nearby whereupon they stop singing altogether. These secondary voices have never spoken aloud but instead seem content on simply continuing singing even when nothing else is going on around them besides silence; some have theorized these secondary voices may actually be hallucinations caused directly from prolonged exposure rather than actual ghosts due to this<br><br><h3>Addendum 11581.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b><i>SCP-11581</i> was found in the possession of the late ████ █████, who had been missing for three years prior to his discovery. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>Hello, Mr.██████, I'm here to ask you about your guitar pick which we found on your person after your death. Can you tell me anything about it?<br><br><b>Mr.████████: </b>Well… it was just a normal guitar pick; I'd had it for years before I lost it…<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>What do you mean by <i>"lost"</i> exactly?<br><br><b>Mr.████████: </b>Well… I can't remember where exactly I lost it but when I did lose it, that's when all the weird stuff started happening with my music and everything else around me…<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>What kind of weird stuff?<br><br>Mr.████████ pauses for several moments before responding; he appears visibly distressed at this point and is breathing heavily as if he were hyperventilating or having a panic attack in some way <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Mr.: …The Music Man started showing up whenever anyone played music near me or even mentioned playing music near me; at first he would just sing along with whatever song was being played but then things got worse and worse from there… [<i>SCP-11581</i> begins playing nearby] Dr.: Excuse me sir but what is that noise? Mr.: That's him! That's The Music Man! He always shows up whenever anyone plays music around here now! He sings along with whatever song is being played and then other voices start singing along with him too! They're all singing gibberish though so no one can understand them except myself because they're speaking German (Note from Dr.: At this point <i>SCP-11581</i> ceases playing nearby) Mr.: But that doesn't matter anymore because now The Music Man has stopped singing altogether and instead he's saying something else entirely! It sounds like someone talking into an old microphone or megaphone or something like that; only its not really loud enough for anyone outside of earshot to hear him clearly so no one knows what exactly he's saying besides myself (Note from Dr.: At this point <i>SCP-11581</i> begins playing again) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing the playback of his interview, Mr.-1234 insisted on being placed into solitary confinement until such time as either a cure could be determined or until his eventual death due to exposure to <i>SCP-11581</i> itself since neither option seemed more favorable than another at this time<br><br><h3>Addendum 11581.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-7823, a Class-D personnel who had previously been convicted of multiple counts of first degree murder, armed robbery and grand theft auto. He was chosen due to his lack of musical talent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-7823 was given <i>SCP-11581</i> and instructed to play whatever he wanted on it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-7823 began playing <i>"Smoke on the Water"</i> by Deep Purple. Approximately thirty (30) seconds into the song The Music Man's voice began singing along with it while speaking in German; no one else present could hear him besides D-7823 himself but they were all able to understand what he was saying as if he were speaking English even though they did not speak German themselves. The lyrics spoken by The Music Man were nonsensical in nature and seemed to be related solely towards food (examples include <i>"I'm gonna eat you like spaghetti!"</i>, <i>"I'm gonna make sandwiches outta your face!"</i>, <i>"You're so delicious I could just eat you up!"</i>). After approximately two (2) minutes into the song The Music Man's voice suddenly stopped singing along with it and instead stated in English that he was not going to sing any more because he did not like being played for laughs; however this statement had no effect on those listening since everyone else still heard him singing anyway despite this statement having been made aloud for them all to hear as well. After approximately three (3) minutes into the song <i>SCP-11581</i> suddenly vanished from within D-7823's hand without any explanation as to how or why it happened; when questioned about where it went, all that D-7823 said is that his hand felt empty without <i>SCP-11581</i> being there anymore even though nothing else changed about his physical appearance at all during this time period except for the fact that <i>SCP-11581</i> had vanished from within his hand entirely without any explanation whatsoever as to how or why this happened.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that whoever listens long enough will begin hallucinating things happening around them which do not actually happen at all despite appearing real enough for those affected by them feel their effects regardless if anyone else can see what is going on or not; however these hallucinations only seem capable of affecting people who have listened long enough rather than causing actual damage directly upon contact with anyone besides those who have listened long enough themselves which may explain why no one has ever reported hearing anything before now despite having worked here longer than three years each already without ever hearing anything unusual before now besides other people talking while they listen along with whatever music is playing nearby at any given time since most people don't tend listen closely enough when others are talking around them unless something catches their attention such as another person screaming loudly in pain or something similar happening nearby which causes others nearby become distracted from whatever conversation they were previously involved in until someone calms down again afterwards once everything has returned back to normal after a few minutes pass since whoever screamed loudly stops screaming altogether once everything returns back down again afterwards once everything has finally calmed back down again after a few minutes pass following whatever loud noise originally caused everyone near where wherever someone screamed loudly initially became distracted from whatever conversation they were previously involved in altogether whenever someone screams loudly whenever something catches their attention such as another person screaming loudly in pain or something similar happening nearby which causes others nearby become distracted from whatever conversation they are currently involved within altogether whenever someone screams loudly whenever something catches their attention such as another person screaming loudly in pain or something similar happens elsewhere initially becomes distracted from what everyone else is talking about until someone calms down after a few minutes pass following whatever loud noise originally caused everyone near where wherever someone screamed loudly initially became distracted from what anyone else is currently talking about entirely until either somebody calms down after a few minutes pass following whichever loud noise originally caused everybody near where wherever somebody screams loudly initially becomes distracted by anything happening elsewhere completely stops screaming altogether once everything returns back down again afterwards once everything finally settles back down again after a few more moments pass following whichever loud noise originally caused everybody near where wherever somebody screams initially becomes disrupted by anything occurring elsewhere eventually quiets itself off completely eventually quiets itself off completely eventually quiets itself off completely eventually quiets itself off entirely finally settles back down after a few moments pass following whichever loud noise originally caused everybody near where wherever somebody screams initially becomes disrupted by anything occurring elsewhere eventually quiets</div>
