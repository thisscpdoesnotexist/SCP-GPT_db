This dimension is inhabited by an unknown species of humanoids, designated <i>SCP-16034</i>-1. All attempts at communication with them have failed, as they do not seem to be able to hear anything outside of the range of human hearing.<br><br><i>SCP-16034</i> was discovered in a thrift store in ████, USA after several civilians reported seeing <i>"ghosts"</i> walking around the store and playing music on the record player located there. The Foundation was alerted and agents were sent out to investigate. A cover story about faulty wiring was planted in local media outlets and all civilians who had seen <i>SCP-16034</i> were given Class A amnestics and released from Foundation custody.<br><br>The following message has been engraved into the back side of <i>SCP-16034</i>:<br><br><h3>Addendum 16034.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████, former owner of the thrift store where <i>SCP-16034</i> was found.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted three days after <i>SCP-16034</i> was discovered by the Foundation. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████, I'm Doctor █████████ from the Foundation, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today about your experience with <i>SCP-16034</i>. <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Sure thing Doc, anything to help out a friend of yours! So what do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Well firstly I'd like to ask how long you've owned this store for? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Oh let's see… it must be about five years now since I bought it from old man [REDACTED]. He had owned it for decades before that though so I guess that makes me one of the longest running owners in this town! <Mr.:██'s eyes begin darting back and forth across his field of vision at an increasingly fast pace> <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Is something wrong sir? Mr.:██'s eyes stop darting and he stares straight ahead again<Mr.:██>: No no Doc everything is just fine! Now if we could get on with this interview… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After interviewing ███ the subject became hostile towards all personnel present and attempted to attack them using a nearby chair as a weapon before being subdued by security personnel and sedated by medical staff . It is believed that listening to <i>SCP-16034</i> has some kind of effect on people who have heard it before but not listened again afterwards . Further testing is required into whether or not these effects are permanent or can be reversed .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16034.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-16034-1 (male, age 25)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to put on headphones and listen to <i>SCP-16034</i>. The subject complied. No anomalous activity was observed for the next five minutes. At the end of this time, subject reported feeling a <i>"buzzing sensation"</i> in his ears which persisted for another minute before fading away. Subject reported hearing <i>"a strange voice speaking gibberish"</i> during this time.<br><br>Experiment #: 2<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-16034-2 (female, age 23), D-16035 (male, age 21)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Two subjects were instructed to listen to <i>SCP-16034</i> together while wearing headphones and sitting in adjacent rooms with one another. Both subjects complied without incident or injury. No anomalous activity was observed for the next five minutes after which time both subjects reported hearing <i>"a strange voice speaking gibberish"</i>. They also reported feeling a <i>"buzzing sensation"</i> in their ears which persisted for another minute before fading away completely as well as seeing bright flashes of light coming from each other's rooms despite there being no light sources present at that time other than standard fluorescent lighting . This effect lasted approximately two minutes before disappearing completely . Neither subject sustained any physical injuries or side effects afterwards but both expressed extreme discomfort during and after the experiment due to headaches and nausea caused by exposure to loud noises they claim they heard coming from each others' rooms though neither could understand what was being said .<br><br>Experiment #: 3</div>
