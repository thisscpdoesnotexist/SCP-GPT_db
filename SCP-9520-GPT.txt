It is ████ brand and has a value of 1 cent. It appears to be made out of plastic, but tests have shown that it is made out of █████.<br><br><i>SCP-9520</i> was found on the ground next to a bunch of other lego pieces in Newark, New Jersey by Agent [REDACTED]. Agent [REDACTED] was just passing through when he came across the pieces and decided to put them in his pocket for later use. When later testing revealed that one piece was missing from the bunch, Agent [REDACTED] realized that he had picked up <i>SCP-9520</i> by accident. When a search for said object was done at Site 17, it became apparent that <i>SCP-9520</i> had moved from place to place over time without being noticed until it landed in D-Class' hands who then proceeded to test if <i>SCP-9520</i> could be used as a weapon against personnel with no success.<br><br>After several days with no progress on testing involving <i>SCP-9520</i> agent [REDACTED] suggested we test if it would become affected by magnets or electricity since <i>"it seems kind of metal"</i>. Tests involving this method showed some progress as putting either magnetically or electrically charged objects next to <i>SCP-950</i> caused changes in its molecular structure making it heavier and harder than before but not affecting its size or shape at all (See Addendum).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9520</i> was found in Newark, New Jersey.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9520.1 :</h3> Experiment Log.<br><br><br>Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Experiment: D-Class is to pick up <i>SCP-9520</i> and attempt to use it as a weapon against personnel.<br><br><br>Results: D-Class was unable to harm any personnel with <i>SCP-9520</i> even after several attempts at trying. Personnel were not harmed by the attempts but did suffer minor papercuts from the attempted usage of <i>SCP-9520</i> as a weapon.<br><br><br>Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Experiment: Dr [REDACTED] is going to use electricity on <i>SCP-9520</i> while it is held in place with a magnet.<br><br><br>Results: The charge caused an immediate change in its molecular structure making it heavier, harder and sharper than before without changing its size or shape at all (See Addendum). Further testing revealed that this effect would only last for approximately 5 minutes after which time <i>SCP-950</i> would return to its normal properties unless charged again with electricity or magnetically charged again using another object that has been electrically charged beforehand (See Addendum). After several tests involving this we discovered that when hit by something hard enough, like a fist, the effects of charging dissipate faster than normal instead of returning back to normal over time which allowed us to test for sharpness and quality of material used in construction (see test log for more details).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9520.2 :</h3> Test Log.<br><br><br>Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Test: Dr [REDACTED] is to test the sharpness of <i>SCP-9520</i> using a piece of paper as a test subject.<br><br><br>Results: <i>SCP-9520</i> cut through the sheet of paper in 6 pieces. This was done by holding it like a knife and slicing downwards at an angle into the sheet of paper.<br><br><br>Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Test: Dr [REDACTED] is to use some electricity on <i>SCP-9520</i> and then hit it with a hammer made out of another metal.<br><br><br>Results: The charge caused an immediate change in its molecular structure making it heavier, harder, sharper and more rigid than before without changing its size or shape at all (See Addendum). When hit with the hammer, it did not break but instead dented slightly into itself forming small indents that can only be seen under microscope (See photo). Further testing revealed that this effect would only last for approximately 5 minutes after which time <i>SCP-950</i> would return to its normal properties unless charged again with electricity or magnetically charged again using another object that has been electrically charged beforehand (See Addendum). Dr [REDACTED] also discovered that when hit by something hard enough, like a fist, the effects of charging dissipate faster than normal instead of returning back to normal over time which allowed us to test for sharpness and quality of material used in construction (see test log for more details</div>
