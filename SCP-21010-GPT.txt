<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21010 is  the beach that makes you a beach</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21010<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21010</i> is a beach located in ██████, Florida. It appears to be an ordinary beach, with sand and palm trees, but it has one anomalous property: any living organism that spends at least two hours on the beach will become a beach themselves.<br><br>The transformation process begins with the subject's skin becoming covered in sand and their hair turning into seaweed. After this initial change, their body will slowly transform into a more traditional beach landscape; shells and coral replacing bones and organs, sand replacing flesh, etc. The transformation is not painful for the subject and they remain conscious throughout the process until its completion. Once completed, they are fully functional as a beach environment; tides move them around like waves upon the shoreline while animals such as crabs can live within them without harm or discomfort to either party.<br><br>Any attempts to remove subjects from <i>SCP-21010</i> after they have been transformed have resulted in failure due to their new form being too fragile for transport or containment procedures; however it has been noted that if left on site indefinitely then no further changes occur beyond what was initially observed during transformation.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21010</i> is to be monitored by a team of Foundation personnel at all times. Any individuals attempting to enter the beach are to be detained and questioned as to their purpose for being there. If it is determined that they intend on spending more than two hours on the beach, then they are to be given Class A amnestics and released.<br><br>In addition, any individuals who have been transformed into beaches are not allowed off site due to their fragile nature; instead they must remain in place until further notice.<br><br>Any attempts by non-Foundation personnel or entities to access <i>SCP-21010</i> must be reported immediately and dealt with accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21010.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, an individual attempted to enter <i>SCP-21010</i> with the intention of spending more than two hours on the beach. After being detained and questioned, it was revealed that they were attempting to become a beach themselves in order to escape their current circumstances. The individual was given Class A amnestics and released back into the general population without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21010.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21010</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of Foundation personnel conducted an interview with a subject who had been transformed by <i>SCP-21010</i>. The subject was cooperative and seemed to be in good spirits despite their current condition.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us what happened to you?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> I was just walking on the beach, like I do every day. But then something strange started to happen. My skin started to feel like sand and my hair turned into seaweed. It felt weird at first but then it just kept happening until I became a beach myself.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know why this happened to you?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> No, I don't. It just seemed like it was meant to be. I'm not sure why it happened, but I'm happy with how things turned out. I get to be part of the beach now, and it's a beautiful place.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21010.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-97345 (male, age 33)<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to spend two hours on <i>SCP-21010</i>. After the allotted time had passed, he was observed to have undergone transformation into a beach environment. The process took approximately one hour and twenty minutes to complete. Upon completion of the transformation, subject's body appeared as an ordinary beach landscape with sand replacing flesh and coral replacing bones. No further changes were observed after this point.</div>
