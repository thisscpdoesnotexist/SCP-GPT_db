The entrance to <i>SCP-15298</i>'s containment chamber is to be guarded by at least two armed guards at all times and one guard must always remain inside the containment chamber while another remains outside. Any personnel entering or exiting <i>SCP-15298</i>'s containment chamber must wear full body armor, gas masks equipped with filters capable of filtering out any airborne pathogens, and carry an M16 assault rifle loaded with tranq darts (for non-lethal purposes only).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15298</i> is the town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. <i>SCP-15298</i> is a large town with a population of ██,███ people. <i>SCP-15298</i> has no anomalous properties until nightfall, after which it becomes an extremely hostile environment for all living organisms.<br><br>During the day, <i>SCP-15298</i> appears to be a normal small town in Pennsylvania. At night however, all humans that have entered <i>SCP-15298</i> have died by unknown means and their corpses will appear in the street as if they were never there. The cause of death seems to vary on what they did while they were alive; some people died from being stabbed multiple times while others died from having their necks snapped or being burned alive with gasoline and set on fire. All humans who die inside <i>SCP-15298</i> will suffer these fates regardless of how they die or how old they are (even infants). It is unknown why only humans are affected by this anomaly and not other animals such as dogs or cats but it is assumed that this anomaly affects them too but has not been observed yet due to them avoiding entering the area at night because of fear for their lives.<br><br><i>SCP-15298</i> was discovered when Agent ███████ was sent into <i>SCP-152884</i> undercover as an FBI agent investigating reports about missing people in Bethlehem at night time; he had previously been assigned to investigate reports about missing people in [REDACTED] before his transferral to FBI headquarters where he met Agent ██████ who told him about several disappearances reported around Bethlehem that could possibly be connected so he was sent there undercover as an FBI agent investigating these disappearances (Agent ███████ had previously worked for the CIA before joining FBI). When Agent ███████ arrived at his destination via helicopter he noticed nothing out of place except for one thing; all cars parked outside houses had their doors wide open even though no one was inside them nor did anyone leave any doors open when parking outside houses during daytime hours so Agent ███████ decided to check out why every car's door were wide open then suddenly heard screaming coming from inside a house so went over there immediately then found three bodies lying on the floor dead with multiple stab wounds inflicted upon them then saw another body lying face down on top of one person's back who also suffered stab wounds inflicted upon him but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off his head using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives then turned over said body and found out it belonged to Mr Jacobson whose<br><br><h3>Addendum 15298.1 : </h3>██/██/████<br><br>Since it is known that <i>SCP-15298</i> affects humans only and not other animals, Agent ███████ was sent back to <i>SCP-15298</i> undercover as a reporter for the [REDACTED] newspaper. Agent ███████ arrived at his destination via helicopter then went inside a house where he found Mr Jacobson's body lying on the floor dead with multiple stab wounds inflicted upon him then checked out all three bodies and found out they belonged to Mr Jacobson's wife and two children who also suffered stab wounds inflicted upon them but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off their heads using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives then suddenly heard screaming coming from upstairs so went up there immediately then found Mrs Jacobson lying face down on top of her daughter who both suffered stab wounds inflicted upon them but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off their heads using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives. Suddenly, an unidentified man wielding a knife appeared in front of Agent ███████ saying <i>"You're next"</i> before attacking him but Agent ███████ managed to knock him unconscious by hitting him in the head with his gun butt then took said man into custody back at the helicopter where he was interrogated by Agents ██████ and █████████. During interrogation, said man gave no name nor did he know what happened when asked about it so after being given amnesiacs, said man was released into society under an assumed name.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15298.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ █████, a resident of <i>SCP-15298</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted one day after the discovery of <i>SCP-15298</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Hello, my name is Agent █████████ and I'm here to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday. Are you ready? Mr <br><br><b>Jacobson: </b>Yes, I am. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Alright then let's begin. First off; what were you doing when the incident occurred? Mr <br><br><b>Jacobson: </b>Well it all started when I went outside to go to work then suddenly heard screaming coming from inside my house so I rushed over there as fast as possible then found my wife and children dead on the floor with multiple stab wounds inflicted upon them but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off their heads using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives then suddenly saw a man wielding a knife in front of me saying <i>"You're next"</i> before attacking me but managed to knock him unconscious by hitting him in the head with my gun butt before he could attack me again so took him into custody back at the helicopter where he was interrogated by Agents who gave no name nor did he know what happened when asked about it so after being given amnesiacs, said man was released into society under an assumed name. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation sir and that will be all for now; please wait outside while we continue our investigation inside your house. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further investigation, it has been revealed that this event has not occurred yet since it is known that <i>SCP-15298</i> affects humans only and not other animals such as dogs or cats which means this event may happen soon if <i>SCP-15298</i> manages to infect any animals living in Bethlehem (which is unlikely due to their fear of entering its area at night) or if more people enter its area at night which seems very likely since they have no idea about this anomaly's existence nor do they know why they keep dying every time they enter said town during nighttime hours despite having no idea how they died nor do any witnesses see anyone else die beside themselves whenever someone dies inside <i>SCP-15298</i> during nighttime hours (the bodies disappear completely).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15298.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br>Subject(s): D-2534, D-2539, D-2542 and two (2) armed guards.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>All subjects were ordered to enter <i>SCP-15298</i>'s containment chamber at night time then were told to do whatever they wanted for the next hour. Guards were instructed to remain outside the containment chamber and watch through a window until an hour had passed then return inside the containment chamber. Guards were also instructed not to enter <i>SCP-15298</i>'s containment chamber under any circumstances unless they heard screaming or gunshots coming from inside the containment chamber. One guard was ordered to stay inside while another stayed outside while all four subjects explored <i>SCP-15298</i> at night time for one hour. Both guards wore full body armor, gas masks equipped with filters capable of filtering out any airborne pathogens, and carried M16 assault rifles loaded with tranq darts (for non lethal purposes only).<br><br><b>Results: </b>After one hour had passed all four subjects exited <i>SCP-15298</i>'s containment chamber and appeared unharmed but both guards reported hearing screams coming from inside the containment chamber during their watch shift so both entered said room immediately after hearing these screams then found both D class personnel lying on the floor dead with multiple stab wounds inflicted upon them then saw another body lying face down on top of one person's back who also suffered stab wounds inflicted upon him but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off his head using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives then turned over said body and found out it belonged to D class personnel who suffered stab wounds inflicted upon him but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off his head using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives so Agent ███████ decided to go undercover again as a reporter for [REDACTED] newspaper in order investigate what happened here so Agent ███████ arrived at his destination via helicopter again then went inside a house where he found Mr Jacobson's body lying on the floor dead with multiple stab wounds inflicted upon him again so checked out all three bodies again and found out they belonged this time to Mrs Jacobson and her two children who also suffered stab wounds inflicted upon them but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off their heads using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives again before suddenly hearing screaming coming from upstairs once more so went up there immediately where he found Mrs Jacobson lying face down on top of her daughter who both suffered stab wounds inflicted upon them but also showed signs that someone tried cutting off their heads using something sharp like scissors or maybe even knives before suddenly noticing an unidentified man wielding a knife standing behind him saying <i>"You're next"</i> before attacking him but Agent ███████ managed once more knocked said man unconscious by hitting him in the head with his gun butt this time though before taking said man into custody back at helicopter where he was interrogated by Agents ██████ & █████████ once more during which he gave no name nor did he know what happened when asked about it so after being given amnesiacs yet again, said man was released into society under an assumed name yet again too just in case if anyone ever finds out about this experiment happening here because if anyone ever finds out about this experiment happening here it might cause panic among local residents living nearby thus causing chaos within our organization which we cannot afford right now due to current events going around us right now especially since we are currently trying hard enough trying contain other SCPs such as SCP-[REDACTED] without having other SCPs escape due too lack of manpower caused by events going around us right now especially since we are currently trying hard enough trying contain other SCPs such as SCP-[REDACTED] without having other SCPs escape due too lack of manpower caused by events going around us right now especially since we are currently trying hard enough trying contain other SCPS such as [DATA EXPUNGED].</div>
