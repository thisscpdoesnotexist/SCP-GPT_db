The chamber should be equipped with a variety of toys and objects that <i>SCP-17044</i> can interact with, as well as food and water suitable for muskrats.<br><br>Any attempts at reversing the effects of <i>SCP-17044</i>'s transformation must first be approved by the Site Director.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17044</i> is a muskrat, which was formerly Elon Musk. <i>SCP-17044</i> appears to have retained its human intelligence and memories, although it has difficulty expressing them in its current form.<br><br><i>SCP-17044</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it attempts to interact with technology or machinery; the object will be able to understand and operate the device as if it were still human. It also demonstrates an increased aptitude for engineering and construction tasks, often completing projects that would take a normal muskrat several days in mere minutes.<br><br>The cause of <i>SCP-17044</i>'s transformation remains unknown; however, all attempts at reversing the effects have been unsuccessful thus far.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17044.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17044</i> was found in a parking lot in Palo Alto, California. It had apparently been living there for several weeks prior to its discovery, scavenging for food and building small structures out of discarded materials. After being taken into Foundation custody, it was determined that the individual formerly known as Elon Musk had spontaneously and irreversibly transformed into a muskrat under mysterious circumstances.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17044.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17044</i> was interviewed in an attempt to gain further insight into its transformation.

It's like my body just changed without warning.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17044.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test 1: <i>SCP-17044</i> was presented with a laptop computer and instructed to access the internet. Despite its limited physical capabilities, it was able to navigate the web browser and successfully locate a variety of websites.<br><br>Test 2: <i>SCP-17044</i> was presented with a disassembled radio and instructed to reassemble it. It successfully completed this task in under five minutes, displaying an advanced understanding of electrical engineering principles.</div>
