I picked it up and examined it. It was a normal coin, but there were some numbers written on it: <i>"<i>SCP-15678</i>"</i>. I looked at the description of <i>SCP-15678</i> and saw that someone had tried to access this file before me. So, I decided to flip the coin just for fun. When I flipped the coin, everything turned black and white around me. After that, my vision returned to normal and all my memories from before flipping <i>SCP-15678</i> were gone. The only thing remaining was <i>SCP-15678</i> in my hand with its description in front of me again. Everything else about myself has been erased from my memory including what happened before finding <i>SCP-15678</i> . All I know is that now all of my memories are about how great Site 19 is! -Dr ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 15678.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br>+Interview 15678-1 -Interview 15678-1 <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Researcher ████ <Begin Log, [3/15/20██]> Researcher <br><br><b>████: </b>Hello, Dr. ██████.
