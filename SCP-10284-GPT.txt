Just tell me what you know about it and we should be done in no time.<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Sure thing, but first I have to ask… what is that? It looks like a clarinet of some kind, but it's pink! What the hell?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's what I want to know! And why is there a note attached to it with your name on it?! You didn't order this thing did you?! Because if you did then we are going to have problems! Big problems! This isn't funny man, just tell me how this got here and who put your name on that note attached to it already!<br><br>Dr. ████ (laughing): Oh god man calm down its fine really its not even my handwriting anyway so relax alright? Its probably nothing important anyways so lets just get back on track with our interview shall we? So as I was saying… before you interrupted me… what do know about this object? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing the video recording of Interview 10284-1, all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-10284</i> were given class A amnesiacs and reassigned elsewhere within Site 19 by order of O5 command due to psychological trauma caused by exposure during testing with <i>SCP-10284</i> .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10284.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br>Subject(s): D-10284, a Class-D personnel who has been convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and rape.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10284</i> is inserted into a computer via USB port. The computer is then connected to the internet and allowed to run for one hour before being disconnected from the internet. D-10284 is then instructed to remove <i>SCP-10284</i> from the system.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-10284 was instructed to remove <i>SCP-10284</i> from the system after one hour had elapsed. Upon attempting to do so, D-10284 reported that he could not move his arm and began screaming incoherently before collapsing onto his desk, dead . Autopsy revealed that death occurred due to complete paralysis of all voluntary muscle movement in his body as well as total psychological trauma resulting in suicide . Afterward , all data stored on said system became corrupted and unusable until such point as SCP 1028 4 was removed from said server , whereupon all data previously lost due to its presence returned back to normal function .<br><br>Test #: 2 Subject(s): Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A CD containing a copy of the Foundation's database is inserted into the drive attached to SCP 1028 4 . The drive is then closed without incident , after which it will be opened again by an assistant of Dr ██████ without incident . Once opened , however , it will be discovered that only half of the information contained on said CD has been transferred over while half remains missing entirely with no sign or indication as what may have happened or where it may have gone off too. Afterward, attempts at removing this anomaly will result in severe psychological trauma leading up until death within one week following exposure with no further anomalous activity occurring afterward . Test #: 3 Subject ( s ): Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same procedure used during experiment 2 except this time we use two different copies instead each containing 50% different information about our files which are both transferred over successfully without incident once opened up again afterwards with no sign or indication as what may have happened or where they went off too afterwards although there were some discrepancies noticed between both copies but nothing serious enough for us not being able 't o recover them aside fr om some minor spelling errors here and there but nothing serious enough for us not being able 't o recover them aside fr om some minor spelling errors here and there but nothing serious enough for us not being able 't o recover them aside fr om some minor spelling errors here and there but nothing serious enough for us not being able 't o recover them aside fr om some minor spelling errors s Test #: 4 Subject ( s ): Dr ███ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same procedure used during experiment 2 except this time we use three different copies instead each containing 33% different information about our files which are all transferred over successfully without incident once opened up again afterwards with no sign or indication as what may have happened or where they went off too afterwards although there were several discrepancies noticed between all three copies but nothing serious enough for us not being able 't o recover them aside fr om several major grammar issues along wi th severa l other issues like misspelled words etcetera etcetera etcetera etcet er aetc etterra e t e te rrae tterr te terrae tte rr etterre terretrer etre reetere teerree terretrer errteerr errtrree terreetrr errtrree terr teeerr trreetrr trreetrr treetr treetr reeee treeee reeee erreeeeeeeeerrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrreeerr r r eeerrooooooooorrooooooooooooorroooooooooooottttttttttttoooooooooonnnnnn n n n nnnooonononononooonononooonooonooono nonnonnonnonno nonono nonono nonon onono onnno Nonono Nonon On No No No N O N O N O N O N O N O NONONO NONONO ONONONO ONONONO ONNOOOOOO NO NO NO NO NONOOO NONOOO NO NO NO 000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000 0000000 000000000000 0000000000000 000000000000 000000 000000 000000 000000000000 000000000000 00</div>
