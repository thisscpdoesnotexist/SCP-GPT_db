It has been described as <i>"the idea that we can do better"</i>, and <i>"a promise to make things right"</i>. <i>SCP-9967</i>-1 is currently uncontained.<br><br><i>SCP-9967</i> was discovered on 05/04/1999, when it was realized that there were no records of any organization matching the description of the Foundation in existence prior to this date, despite numerous historical documents referring to such an organization existing since at least 18██. Of note is <i>SCP-1885</i> , who claims to have been involved with the creation of the anomaly under investigation by Dr. ██████ during this time period (See Addendum 1). This claim has not yet been verified by any other members of staff, but remains under investigation due to its apparent connection with <i>SCP-1885</i>'s anomalous properties .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9967.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ██████, former member of the Foundation<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Former member of the Foundation, now known as <i>SCP-9967</i>-2. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, D-9967-2. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9967</i>-2: </b>Morning? It's 4 in the afternoon! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you what time zone you were in when we met last week… <i>SCP-9967</i>-2 appears to think for a moment before responding. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9967</i>-2: </b>Oh yeah, that's right… This is all so confusing! And there are so many people here who need help… How can I help them all at once? Dr. ██████ nods sympathetically and takes note on his clipboard before continuing the interview with SCP 9967 2 .<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>When did you first become aware of your anomalous properties?<br><br>SCP 9967 2: Well it was about a year ago now; my life had been going down hill for quite some time by then and I was just about ready to give up entirely when something happened that changed everything for me! As soon as it happened everything seemed to fall into place and suddenly my life made sense again! It was like someone had just turned on a light switch inside my head and suddenly everything seemed so clear! For once in my life things felt right with the world again; like they were supposed to be this way all along but somehow I'd managed to lose sight of that fact somewhere along the line…<br><br>Dr . ███: What happened exactly?<br><br>SCP 99 67 2: Well it started out pretty much how any other day went back then; waking up hung over after another night spent drowning myself in cheap beer while watching bad TV shows until passing out on top of my bed still fully clothed from yesterday morning never even making it into bed itself let alone getting undressed or taking a shower or anything else really important like that (laughs). Just another typical day really but then something amazing happened - there was an ad on TV for this new organization called <i>"The Foundation"</i>. At first I thought nothing of it but then later when walking through town later that day there were posters everywhere advertising this same organization - <i>"The Foundation"</i> - promoting its services as being able to make anyone feel better about their lives no matter how bad things might have gotten over time because they could fix any problem no matter how big or small (laughs). They even gave an address where people could go if they wanted more information about The Foundation's services - well needless to say I didn't waste any time getting myself down there straight away because at last here was something promising me hope after years spent feeling lost without knowing why (laughs)! After arriving at The Foundation's headquarters though things got even stranger than ever before because as soon as I stepped inside these huge doors opened up right in front of me revealing what looked like some kind of futuristic space age chamber filled with hundreds upon thousands upon millions upon billions upon trillions upon quintillions (stops speaking) Upon infinite numbers (stops speaking) Upon infinite numbers(stops speaking) Upon infinite infinities(stops speaking) Of bookshelves containing every book ever written throughout history from every single language from every single culture across every single universe across every single timeline across every alternate reality across every parallel universe across infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity times infinity plus one universes plus one universes plus one universes plus one universes plus one universes plus one infinities which is equal two point two five nine three six seven eight nine four five eight three two four seven six nine zero six three five seven four eight nine minus ten infinities which is equal negative zero point zero zero zero zero 0 0 0 0 000 000 000 000 001 001 010 010 010 101 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218<br><br><h3>Addendum 9967.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>9967-1: </b>On 05/04/1999, a document was created describing the purpose of the Foundation.

This copy contained several grammatical errors , spelling mistakes , and formatting issues . <br><br><b>Results: </b>After ██ days, it was discovered that <i>SCP-9967</i> had incorporated both documents within its structure (See Addendum 2). Experiment <br><br><b>9967-3: </b>On 05/04/1999 , several documents were created describing different aspects of the Foundation's history . These documents were then sealed in envelopes , and placed into storage . After ██ days , these documents were removed from their envelopes by Drs. ███████ & ████████ for study purposes (See Addendum 3). <br><br><b>Results: </b>None recorded</div>
