So what did the president want to talk to you about? <br><br><b>█████████: </b>He wanted to talk about the recent terrorist attack in Paris that happened a few days ago… but that's not important right now!

It's just unbelievable! <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>That does sound like an amazing opportunity sir… but what exactly did he tell you this new position would be? █████████ <br><br><b>[laughs]: </b>Well first off all, I'd be getting my own office in Washington DC of course!

(Interview Log 15565 Interview A)<br><br>Interview Log 15565 Interview A:<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>What are your plans for gun control?<br><br>D - 829 10: I will make sure that all guns are banned in the United States Of America , and that no one can buy a gun anymore . No one should have the power to take someone's life away from them .<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>█████: </b>And what about abortion rights? What do you think about those?<br><br>D - 829 10: I think they should stay legal , but only if the mother's life is in danger because of it . If she doesn't want to have it , then she shouldn't be forced into having an abortion just because her parents don't want her to have a baby with someone who isn't their race or religion . This country has freedom of choice , so why take away something like this ? It's not fair at all!</div>
