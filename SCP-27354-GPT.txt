            <img class="scp-image" src="https://scpapi.koll.ai//SCP-27354-GPT.png" alt="Illustration of SCP-27354" />
        
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27354 is a seemingly ordinary wooden stage door from the early 20th century, exhibiting a faded red paint with flaking edges and a brass handle worn from extensive use. The door measures 2.1 x 0.9 meters and has been fitted with modern electronic locks as a means of containment and testing security.</p>
<p>When a subject passes through SCP-27354, they emerge onto a theatre stage believed to be metaphysically linked to a moment from the subject's past where they experienced significant distress or made a pivotal decision. Upon crossing the threshold, the subject enters a state of reality that runs parallel to their original experience. During the event replication, the subject is provided the opportunity to change the course of events.</p>
<p>Notably, alterations made during these reenactments do not affect the primary reality's historical record. However, the psychological effects on subjects are pronounced, suggesting alterations to their personal memories or perceptions of the altered events. SCP-27354's reenactments are believed to be construct simulations, hypothesized to be generated by a currently unknown sentient source.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-27354 is to be contained within a standard secure storage locker in Site-██. Access to SCP-27354 requires Level-3 clearance, and it can only be experimented with under the supervision of personnel with Level-4 clearance or higher. In order to prevent unauthorized usage, the door is fitted with an electronic lock that requires a unique access code changed bi-weekly.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are individuals with a history of severe mental illness or psychological trauma permitted to interact with SCP-27354, without explicit approval from the Site Director, due to the unforeseen psychiatric repercussions of historical event alteration.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-27354 was recovered from an abandoned theatre in ████████, England, after several accounts of missing persons and "ghostly enactments" reached local media. Foundation agents embedded in local law enforcement were dispatched to investigate. The theatre was identified as having historical significance, with bookings dating back to the 1910s. SCP-27354 was found backstage, bricked up behind a false wall, suggesting a deliberate attempt to conceal its existence.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Initial Test Log</h3>
<p><strong>Test A - Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-84322, male, aged 34, with a history of petty theft and assault.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to walk through SCP-27354.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject reported experiencing a confrontation he had ten years prior which escalated to violence. In the reenactment, subject chose to walk away, which he claims was "what he wished he’d done."</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject later appeared more cooperative and less aggressive during routine interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Test B - Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-54910, female, aged 29, former financial analyst convicted of insider trading.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to walk through SCP-27354.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject entered a remembered meeting where she first agreed to conduct illegal activities. She declined the offer in the reenactment. Post-test, the subject showed signs of profound relief.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Follow-up psychological evaluations suggest the experience has had a therapeutic impact on D-54910.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log-Extended Testing</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment C - Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-90315, male, aged 42, with a history of severe depression.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was asked to interact with a visage of his younger self during a significant moment of personal failure.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject managed to impart advice that led to a different outcome in the reenactment. Following the test, D-90315 demonstrated increased self-esteem.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> The ethical implications of using SCP-27354 for psychological treatment are under review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experiment D - Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Silas [REDACTED], a volunteer with no significant criminal background, aged 39.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject entered SCP-27354 to revisit a day he received career-changing news.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject did not alter the original decision, stating that the remembered joy and subsequent success were too valuable to him. Post-experiment contemplation revealed no change in demeanor or psychological state.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> The subject's response suggests SCP-27354 may not induce changes when subjects are content with the original outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 4: Incident Report: Containment Breach</h3>
<p><strong>Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<p>A security protocol failure allowed for unauthorized access to SCP-27354. Dr. [REDACTED], consumed by personal guilt over a previous incident unrelated to SCP-27354, made use of the anomaly to alter a personal event that had led to a colleague's injury.</p>
<p>Dr. [REDACTED] emerged from SCP-27354 in a highly distressed state, with altered memories inconsistent with the historical record. Efforts to provide psychological care are underway. SCP-27354's containment protocols have been reviewed and updated to prevent similar incidents.</p>
<h3>Addendum 5: Recovery Logs</h3>
<p>Further investigation into SCP-27354's origin revealed historical documents from the theatre's archives detailing an anonymous donation of the stage door by a patron identified only as "Mx. [REDACTED]". Suspicion has arisen around a potential connection to the Serpent's Hand or another group of interest due to the door's unusual properties. Artifacts found within the wall where SCP-27354 was concealed are currently being analyzed for additional clues.</p>
<h3>Addendum 6: Interview Log with Stagehand</h3>
<p><strong>Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<p><em>An interview was conducted with an elderly individual, [REDACTED], who claimed to have worked at the theatre during the period when SCP-27354 was in use.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Carver</li>
<li><strong>Interviewee:</strong> [REDACTED] - Former stagehand</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The stagehand described actors using the door for a "final rehearsal," believing it to be a good luck charm. They noted that performances were often significantly better following use of SCP-27354 but were otherwise unaware of its true properties. The interviewee was administered Class-B amnestic following the interview.</em></p>
<h3>Addendum 7: Updates</h3>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>
<p>It has been determined that SCP-27354 may only be used by any given individual once. Further attempts to pass through SCP-27354 by subjects show the anomaly remains inert. This one-time-use limitation appears to prevent dependency and limits the range of potential psychological impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>
<p>Advanced neurological studies on post-exposure subjects reveal intricate alterations in memory encoding, suggesting SCP-27354 operates via direct neural interface. Potential applications in the field of psychological reconstruction are being considered, albeit with strong ethical guidelines due to the implications of memory alteration.</p>
<h3>Addendum 8: Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>A suite of operas from the time period of SCP-27354's presumed creation was found within the concealed compartment. Lyrics from the operas reference doors and choices, raising the question if the anomaly was inspired by or directly connected to these artistic works. Further research into potential anomalous influences within early 20th-century theatre culture is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Addendum 9: Experiment Log - Combination with SCP-████</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment E - Date: [REDACTED]</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to ascertain the limits of SCP-27354's reality-altering capabilities, it was tested in conjunction with SCP-████, which has the ability to manipulate local time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-19230, female, aged 26, with a history of recurrent nightmares.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to walk through SCP-27354 while SCP-████ was activated in close proximity.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The process yielded inconclusive results. Subject experienced temporal dissonance without narrative coherence or significant memory alteration. The two SCPs appear to have competing frequencies that disrupt each other's functions.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Cross-SCP experiments have been suspended due to unpredictable outcomes and risks of exacerbating psychological trauma.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 10: Theoretical Essays</h3>
<p>Several theoretical papers have been submitted by Foundation researchers postulating the nature of SCP-27354's operation, including the possibility of a quantum entanglement with the subject's consciousness or an interdimensional space that reflects the subject's psyche.</p>
<p>One paper hypothesizes that SCP-27354 represents a manifestation of collective human desire to alter the past. While interesting, this remains speculative and untestable with current technology and understanding.</p>
<p><em>The documentation of SCP-27354 continues to develop as new insights and information come to light.</em></p>
