On its right hand are two small white pills . It has not been observed ingesting any food or drink during containment, nor does it appear to need sustenance.<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i> will approach groups of children that are trick or treating on Halloween night and give them one of the white pills it carries with it, claiming that the pill will grant them special powers for this year's Halloween while ingesting said pill itself. After doing so, <i>SCP-9020</i>'s appearance will change depending on what costume worn by child receiving pill at time , along with their name being changed to whatever they ask for while taking pill . Once this change is complete, child becomes an instance of <i>SCP-9020</i> - 1 . Instances of SCP - 90 20 - 1 will wander around their hometown until November 1st , when they become catatonic upon full sunrise and return home where they proceed to go into a comatose state until December 25th . During this period instances of 90 20 -1 do not require sustenance or water and lack most bodily functions except for breathing and pulse rate ( though these drop drastically ) . All instances show symptoms described in Document 9 0 2 0 - C T D I {\displaystyle \document{902~CTDI}} Notably , after taking the second substance ( referred to as <i>"drugs"</i> ) given by instance o f 9 0 2 0 ~ G P T i n its original form ( see Addendum ) , subjects regain consciousness in their new costumes/identities almost immediately after sunrise on 12/25 th , though still catatonic until 12 / 26 th when effects wear off entirely . Instances then begin acting normally once again before beginning another transformation into their next costumes/identities which repeats every Halloween.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> was discovered after a video of it giving drugs to a group of children was posted online, causing several children in the area to transform into instances of <i>SCP-9020</i> - 1 .

We would like to ask you some questions. [SCP~902~GPT opens gate and allows agent inside cell.]<br> Agent Salazar : What is your name? [SCP~902~GPT responds with a sound similar to that of a sigh.
