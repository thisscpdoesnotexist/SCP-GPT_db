Any personnel who attempt this without authorization will be terminated immediately after extraction from the box due to the risk of infection by an unknown pathogen that only affects humans and other sentient species found on Earth by exposure during entry into <i>SCP-1990-GPT</i> via 9020's entrance portal (see Addendum 9022). This pathogen has been designated Pestis Sapiens by researchers . It will spread throughout the human body until it reaches their brain stem , whereupon they become instances of <i>SCP-1990-GPT</i> -1a . The only known cure for exposure is immediate removal of affected parts via amputation or bisection , which can result in death due to excessive blood loss.

When the <i>"chameleon circuit"</i> is activated, it will assume the appearance of an object nearby . This function has been used to aid in its concealment from humans, but test subjects have reported being able to see through this disguise when it takes the form of an object that they are intimately familiar with.<br><br><i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> appears to transfer itself between dimensions by opening a portal on one side of a wall near its current location and closing another portal on the other side of said wall. This allows <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> to enter other dimensions without physically traveling . However, <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> prefers physical transportation over opening portals , as it does not enjoy being out in public or interacting with <i>"primitive"</i> humans.<br><br><i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> was discovered after several disappearances occurred around ████████████ High School ,<br> Australia . The first reports were sent out at 01:00 AM local time by several students who had witnessed what they believed was a UFO landing on school grounds. The Foundation was alerted after these reports were made public, whereupon Agent ████████ was sent undercover as Deputy Principal ████ ████████ following the incident's investigation by local authorities and agents embedded within local news organizations . Upon questioning during an interview about his connection with these events, Agent ████████<br> claimed that he had seen something fly overhead while sitting in his car at approximately 12:30 AM before coming into work early for no discernible reason shortly thereafter (See Interview 9021). Further evidence of anomalous activity came from Dr. B████'s discovery last year that <i>SCP-1990-GPT</i> had grown significantly larger since previous measurements taken just prior to containment (See Addendum 9022). After all possible leads regarding this incident failed to produce any results, MTF Pi -4 (<i>"City Slickers"</i>) began canvassing for witnesses and suspects under false pretenses via mobile command center set up at school grounds until Agent ████████ approached them tentatively requesting help identifying what he described as <i>"a blue box under some sorta weird tree"</i>. They would later identify this tree as an instance of <i>SCP-1990-GPT</i> -1b (See Interview 9021).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> Agent ████████ was contacted by <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> after he gave an interview with local news agencies about the incident at ████████████ High School on █/█/2016. <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> asked if he had any knowledge of it, to which Agent ████████ replied that he did not. It then requested to meet him in person so they could talk more freely about what it called <i>"an important matter."</i> After some initial reticence, Agent ████████ agreed to meet with <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> in a vacant lot 15 km from the school grounds , whereupon <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> materialized approximately 1 meter above ground .<br><br>Agent ████████ : So what's this all about?<br><br><i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020: Ah yes , I've been meaning to speak with you for quite some time now. You see, I'm actually a police box from London . My name is TARDIS. And you are ?<br><br>Agent ████████<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9020.1 :</h3> Interview with <i>SCP-9020-GPT</i><br><br>Agent ████████: Well, I guess that's my name.<br><br><i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020: So it is. You may call me TARDIS if you wish . Would you prefer we met in your office or here? It will be more private this way, and we don't have to worry about anyone seeing us together.<br><br>Agent ████████: Here is fine, I guess… so what did you mean earlier when you said <i>"important matter"</i>? What's going on? Why are people disappearing around here? And how the hell did they disappear in the first place?! No one has any information on that! Even the people who saw them go missing don't know anything more than they just disappeared into thin air! How does that even happen!? That makes no sense! And why are there trees growing inside of them?! None of this makes any sense! They're just trees , for God's sake ! They aren't supposed to grow inside other things ! Trees need dirt and sunlight to survive , not concrete floors and fluorescent lighting ! Hell , I doubt they even need sunlight at all ! All they do is cast weird shadows everywhere . It isn't natural ! And what was with all those weird noises coming from them the other day ? The screaming ? Those weren't human voices ! What were those things!? What were even doing in there ? More importantly , where did they come from ? None of it makes any sense !!! Who was screaming like that anyway ?? Where were these voices coming from ?? Why haven't we heard much else since then ?? That doesn't make any sense either !! Who was screaming like that ??? Where are these answers ?????? (Agent ████████ begins making incoherent statements while pacing back and forth agitatedly before calming down.) Agent ████████ : Sorry about that….I'm getting off topic here… can we please get back on track now? <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020 : Yes, yes.. well..(<i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> pauses)…What exactly do number 9022 want with me then? Agent ████████ : 9022…you mean Pestis Sapiens 9022 ..what are …oh right..the tree thingies…..yeah…..well……(Agent ████████ seems nervous during his response)….we intended to capture two specimens for research purposes but only managed to get one before our cover got blown by some kid….who refused point blank leave his tree or let us take it near him without causing a huge scene…..and he kept yelling something about how his mother told him never ever speak to strangers……so yeah……our cover completely blew after he took a picture of us trying to sneakily remove one of the trees while he wasn’t looking…..it caused quite an uproar once it hit twitter……I thought I had lost my job when everyone saw what happened but luckily for me no one really believed what happened was real until today.(pause) We<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9020.2 :</h3> Euclid/Keter reclassification<br><br>Agent ████████: So what did you want to talk about then? <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020: Well, I must say it's rather refreshing to meet someone who doesn't know of my existence by now. It feels like it has been centuries since the last time I met anyone new. You see, there is something of great importance that I need you to do for me… Agent ████████ : Something important..you say? What is it?? ( Agent ████████ begins pacing again while looking at his watch .) <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020 : We can discuss that later though….I'm sure you'll be interested in the new developments happening here at your school after all…..(<i>SCP-9020-GPT</i> pauses)…..You see…..we are currently under attack……from the enemy . Agent ████████ : …the enemy ? Who are they ? (Agent ████████ becomes slightly agitated.) What's going on here!? <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9020: Oh yes , they are most definitely not human . They've been sneaking through my corridors for quite some time now but only recently have they started acting aggressively towards me and attacking people in your dimension. Agent ███████60: How do we stop them from getting through?! Do we need a special key or something?! Is there a code we need to enter or a secret passageway I'm not aware of?! We have an entire floor dedicated to codes! Surely if there</div>
