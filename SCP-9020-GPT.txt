All Foundation personnel are required to speak german at all times while inside <i>SCP-9020</i>, except on ██/██/1943 which is designated [DATA EXPUNGED] for security reasons.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> is a door that leads to a parallel universe in which nazis won. The anomaly was discovered on ██/██/1943 by the Foundation and the date has been designated as █.█.████, the day on which nazis achieved victory and began their new world order of peace and prosperity for all germanic peoples.<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i> can be accessed by opening it while speaking german at all times except on [DATA EXPUNGED]. Once inside, it will become impossible to open from the outside. In this state <i>SCP-9020</i> will emit regular light radiation from its interior without emitting any heat or sound radiation whatsoever . This is thought to be due to [DATA EXPUNGED] but further research is required in order to confirm this theory.<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i>'s interior is a small square room with stone walls, containing one desk covered in documents along with a german typewriter and three chairs facing it . There are no windows or doors inside <i>SCP-9020</i> except for the entrance through which personnel enter after passing through <i>SCP-9020</i>'s active state , which lasts exactly 12 hours before reverting into an inactive state . Inactive <i>SCP-9020</i> emits no light or sound radiation whatsoever from its interior but remains capable of being opened from both sides once again, with no anomalous properties being detected during this phase .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> was first discovered on ██/██/1943 after a report about a strange bright light that had been seen for several minutes on the outskirts of ██████, Germany. The anomaly was then confirmed by two members of Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (<i>"See No Evil"</i>) who were sent to investigate the area along with Agent J█████.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9020.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> Interview<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9020</i> Interviewer: Dr.<br> M███████ Foreword: The following interview was conducted on ██/██/1943, two hours after <i>SCP-9020</i> had been discovered. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> M███████ : Could you please state your name?<br> <i>SCP-9020</i> : I am Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotektor of Czechoslovakia and leader of the Nazi Party since 1941 . Dr.<br> M███████ : How come you are here?<br> <i>SCP-9020</i> : I am here because our Führer ordered me to carry out an investigation regarding the location of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who has gone missing somewhere in Europe . We have found no trace of him anywhere but he is expected to be located soon . And now if you'll excuse me sir , it's almost time for my radio broadcast that runs every night at this time.. Dr.<br> M███████ : One last question, why do you love nazis so much? At least according to your radio broadcasts they seem very nice people…<br> <i>SCP-9020</i>: They are nice people! That is why I love them so much! Each one of them knows how important discipline is in order for a society to work properly and they all contribute in some way or another ! As far as our enemies go… well I would simply say that any animal can be dangerous when cornered ! <End Log><br> Closing Statement: After this interview had concluded it became impossible for Agent J█████ or any member of Mobile Task Force Eta 10 <i>"See No Evil"</i> who were present during the interview to open <i>SCP-92015</i> from the outside without anomalous properties manifesting themselves once again. This means Agent J█████ was stuck inside until [DATA EXPUNGED] led by O5 █████████ which resulted in his death along with several other members of Mobile Task Force Eta 10 <i>"See No Evil"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9020.2 :</h3> [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br>[DATA EXPUNGED]<br></div>
