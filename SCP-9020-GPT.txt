No personnel are allowed within 10 meters of <i>SCP-9020</i> without permission from the project head.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> is a wooden door that leads to a parallel universe in which nazis won. <i>SCP-9020</i> can be entered through the use of <i>SCP-9020</i>-1.<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i> was recovered from an abandoned facility in [REDACTED] by the foundation after reports of unusual activity within the facility were made by local police forces. The location and nature of this facility is currently unknown, and any attempts to locate it have been unsuccessful, with all traces of activity around the area disappearing upon entry into its supposed location.<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i> was discovered during a routine exploration mission by MTF Lambda 7 (<i>"Travelers"</i>) when they found a large steel door labeled <i>"Zaunbrecher"</i> (<br>Translated from German: Breaker). Lambda 7 proceeded into the room to find <i>SCP-9020</i> attached to a wall on one side, while what appears to be some sort of generator was on another side with 2 dead bodies laying nearby it . It appears that both men had been shot through their heads multiple times before being moved near or onto the device after death . Both men appear to be part of an unknown organization , judging by their uniforms and documents found nearby them . The remainder of Lambda 7 team moved forward further into <i>"Breaker"</i>, finding several more bodies within other rooms , where they also found remnants for what seems like some sort industrial manufacturing line or assembly line setup for mass production . They also saw many few living workers moving towards areas labeled <i>"Assembly"</i> , which could possibly have been used for putting together components from earlier parts made elsewhere within <i>"Breaker"</i>. The team continued further until reaching two more rooms, one labeled as storage area A , while another room adjacent said room was labeled as storage area B . In storage room A, Lambda 7 located several crates filled with extremely outdated machinery and weaponry , most likely already obsolete during World War II era due to age if not totally useless now due outdated knowledge required for making them work again now. Over 80% percent looked damaged beyond repairable state now anyway due old age/poor quality materials used back then anyway plus additional damage caused over time using extremely outdated methods/techniques/technology required at that time period anyways. On closer inspection however , team did manage find some few items that appeared functional enough still even though obviously out dated too now but still better than nothing since Foundation does not go out looking specifically for weapons anymore these days anyway unless ordered otherwise since most are extremely outdated anyways like ones found here<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> was found in the <i>"Breaker"</i> facility during a routine exploration mission by MTF Lambda 7 (<i>"Travelers"</i>)<br><br><i>SCP-9020</i> was first discovered inside an abandoned facility located in [DATA EXPUNGED] after reports of unusual activity within the area were made by local police forces. The location and nature of this facility are currently unknown, and any attempts to locate it have been unsuccessful, with all traces of activity around the area disappearing upon entry into its supposed location. The Foundation recovered <i>SCP-9020</i> shortly after its discovery, due to its anomalous properties being discovered at that time.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9020.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9020</i> Exploration Log<br><br>+<br> Open Log - Close Log Date: 03/09/<br>2018 Location: [REDACTED]<br> Time: 1230 Hours Team Leader: Officer ████ ██████ Mission Specialist(s): Agent ██████, Dr. Browning,<br> Junior Researcher Adams Briefing Details: Team is to enter <i>SCP-9020</i>'s room and take photos & video of it for future study.<br> Commanders Notes : Nothing much really to see here . Let's move on. <End log><br> Closing Statement : Nothing was found within the facility except for what appears to be an assembly line once used for producing weapons during WW2 era, along with other machinery used at that time period. No sign of anyone else inside facility besides dead bodies located near what seems like some sort generator which could probably powered up assembly line by harnessing energy from nearby river or something similar also found there . All other traces of activity within this area disappear upon entry into its supposed location , making it extremely hard to locate. <Begin log> Agent Adams enters first into <i>SCP-9020</i> room using flash light attached onto gun while the rest wait outside still standing guard just in case anything happens before they reach inside door . After entering through door he turns left towards wall where camera was located after checking both ways down hallways first before doing so just in case any surprises waiting around corner especially since one hallway appeared longer than other due darkness even with flash light attached to gun pointing straight ahead since only way out now anyway if anything happens since team not allowed bring any extra gear inside plus not enough time locate needed items without drawing unwanted attention besides mission already authorized anyways plus mission objectives don't need us rushing things anyways especially since we already running behind schedule as is anyway but <i>"Breaker"</i> facility definitely looks older than most others we've seen before even though all abandoned looking like this one too but problem here is no sign of anyone else still alive here anyways so let's keep moving on shall we ? Agent Adams began his decent down staircase leading deeper into <i>"Breaker"</i> facility due main entrance too dark now even with flash light attached onto gun (See photo #1). Photo #1 - Agent Adams descends staircase leading deeper into <i>"Breaker"</i> Facility Photo #2 - View Of Entrance To Storage Room A Photo #3 - Close Up Of Storage Room A Door After reaching bottom of stairs , agent turns right and heads towards storage room labeled as A next , taking another photo from doorway (see photo 2) then proceeds inside after a few seconds delay when nothing seen in either direction heading towards storage room doors (see photo 3) . Agents stops briefly when noticing some strange noises coming from over head while standing over door way then proceeds forward again when finding nothing unusual about them besides possibly being made by rats or bats living somewhere within building itself instead ? No signs found anywhere indicating anyone has been active here anytime recently past 5 years ago anyways so best guess these noises must have been made by some kind living creature instead or<br><br><h3>Addendum 9020.2 :</h3><br><br>+<br> Open Log - Close Log Date: 03/09/<br>2018 Location: [REDACTED]<br> Time: 1245 Hours Team Leader: Officer ████ ██████ Mission Specialist(s): Agent ██████, Dr. Browning,<br> Junior Researcher Adams Briefing Details: Team is to explore storage room A and examine all crates inside for anything useful.<br> Commanders Notes : This should be quick , nothing interesting or useful here anyways as already stated during mission briefing besides maybe finding some few functioning items that could still be used now even though better now if we can find some more stuff but nothing like that here at least not now anyways , probably left behind by those who used this place before us if anyone else even was here before us instead ? Not even sure why we came here in first place but oh well , let's just get this over with so we can go home . <End log><br> Closing Statement : <Begin log> Agent Adams enters storage room A via doorway after taking photo of it from outside (see photo 2) then proceeds further into room while shining flashlight around inside room to locate any possible threats ahead including checking back hallway behind him since he entered from only way out once again . He then heads towards large crate located against left wall where he finds several assorted weapons from WW2 era scattered around surrounding area surrounding said crate (see photos 3 & 4). After a brief examination of said weapons, agent turns right towards other wall where he finds another large crate filled with various devices</div>
