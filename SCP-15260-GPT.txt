I would like to ask you a few questions about your family and what happened yesterday . <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>Alright… <br><br><b>Dr. Wilkins: </b>Could you please tell me about your children? How many do you have? <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>I have two kids , one is 18 and the other is 15 . They're both at college right now , so they're not here right now but my wife is in the kitchen if you want to talk to her instead . Dr.: No that's alright, it's just that we need to know as much as possible about your family before we can determine who did this horrible thing… Mr.: Oh…okay then…I'll tell you what happened yesterday <br><br><b>then..Dr.: </b>Thank you sir…<br><br><b>.Mr.: </b>So yesterday morning my daughter [DATA EXPUNGED] called me and told me she was coming back home for a few days because she had some things that needed taking care of here before she went back to school next week …Dr.: Yes sir…Mr.: So when she got here , it seemed like something wasn't quite right with her .. She always has been quiet but this time it was different … It seemed like there were more things on her mind than usual … She didn't say anything though so I didn't think anything of it at first but after a while I started getting really worried about her …Dr.: Why were you worried ?Mr.: Well because she hadn't said anything for hours ! And when I asked her if everything was alright , all she said was <i>"yes"</i> and turned around and walked away from me into another room … So after waiting for another hour or so without hearing any sounds from anywhere in the house except for outside noises ,I decided to go check on my daughter myself .. When i walked into her room though all i saw were bloodstains on the walls and floor with no sign of where they came from or how they got there .. After searching through every room in our house looking for any sign of where my daughter could be or who could've done this terrible thing ,I finally found out where those bloodstains came from..It turns out that some sick bastard had broken into our house while we were sleeping last night (it would've been around 3 or 4 am)and shot both my wife and son point blank range with an assault rifle !!After seeing them lying there dead on their own bedroom floor with bullet holes riddling their bodies everywhere i ran outside screaming bloody murder hoping someone would hear me but no one did ! After calling 911 twice without getting anyone on either line i gave up hope thinking everyone else must be dead too until i heard sirens coming towards our street which lead police officers straight towards our front door !!Dr.; Thankyou sir….we will take it from here now….. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement; Agent Johnson reported that he arrived at scene approximately 5 minutes after receiving call by officers responding to initial report by neighbors; finding <i>SCP-15260</i> within garage upon arrival<br><br><h3>Addendum 15260.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 152-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-88892, a 27 year old Caucasian male.
