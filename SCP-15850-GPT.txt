We were walking home through the cemetery because we live on the other side of it. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>You don't mind if I record this do you? <br><br><b>█████: </b>No, go ahead. So anyway, we're walking through and we see this grave that's been dug up right in front of us. It's kind of weird because there are no other graves around it or even any grass growing around it so we're curious as to why they dug up this one grave but not any others nearby or anything like that. We walk over to take a look at what they left behind and then… (At this point in the interview subject became visibly distressed) Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Take your time sir… (Subject takes several deep breaths before continuing.) <br><br><b>█████: </b>Then my wife starts screaming! She says she can feel something touching her leg so she looks down and there is some sort of hand coming out of the ground! She freaks out so I pick her up and try to run away but then she starts screaming again saying something is touching her neck now! So I turn around with her still in my arms and see another hand coming out from behind us! It grabs onto me too by my shoulder but luckily for me it can't grab onto both people at once so now only my wife is being dragged into the ground by one arm while i'm being dragged by another one on different side! Now all three arms are trying to pull us down into their graves at once but luckily for us they aren't strong enough yet so we manage get free long enough for me to throw my wife over a fence before running back here myself. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>What did these hands look like? Were they human? Animal? Something else entirely? <br><br><b>█████: </b>They looked human… But not quite… They had nails on them like claws too.. And big black eyes.. Like someone had cut those parts off a real person.. And their skin was all wrinkly too.. Like an old person's skin would be if they lived forever… Or maybe just stayed dead forever…. Either way, whatever those things were weren't human anymore…. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement:: After interviewing Mr. & Mrs .
