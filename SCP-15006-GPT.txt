The team is to monitor the population and report any changes in their behaviour or appearance. Any attempts at leaving <i>SCP-15006</i> are to be prevented by any means necessary, including but not limited to:<br><br>Blocking the path of the individual attempting to leave with an ice wall;<br><br>Freezing them with liquid nitrogen;<br><br>Using tranquilizers if they do not respond to other methods; however, due to their ability of surviving extreme low temperatures it may be impossible for them to use this method . In case it does work, a backup plan must be prepared beforehand in case they wake up before being brought back into containment .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15006</i> is a cold-burning planet that emits extreme cold air and freezes everything approaching it. It has a diameter of approximately 20,000 km. <i>SCP-15006</i> was discovered by the Foundation in 19██ when an expedition team was sent to explore the planet. The team reported that the temperature on <i>SCP-15006</i>'s surface was -200 degrees Celsius and all objects touching it instantly froze.<br><br><i>SCP-15006</i> is inhabited by a species of intelligent penguins (<i>SCP-15006</i>-A). These penguins are able to survive in extremely low temperatures, though they require some form of protection from them such as clothing or shelter. The population is estimated at ██ billion individuals and they have been living on <i>SCP-15006</i> for approximately ██ million years. They have developed several technologies which allow them to live on their native planet despite its freezing temperatures, including:<br><br>Shelters made out of ice that are capable of protecting individuals from extreme low temperatures; these shelters also contain heaters powered by nuclear energy which keep the interior warm enough for survival;<br><br>Clothing made out of fur or feathers that protects against extreme low temperatures; these clothes can be removed without causing any harm to the wearer but must be put back on before going outside again; if not worn for over 5 minutes during winter time, severe hypothermia will occur and death will result within one hour unless rewarmed quickly enough; however, if worn continuously during winter time then no ill effects occur even after 24 hours without removal (see Addendum 15606a);<br><br>Food produced through genetic engineering , such as meat products with high fat content which provide warmth when consumed (see Addendum 15606b); however, due to their diet being based mostly around fish this food source makes up only 10% of their total consumption ; in order to survive off this food source completely they would need at least one other food source aside from fish . This has led researchers into speculating that there may be another species inhabiting <i>SCP-15007</i> alongside them who provides them with other sources of food . However, no evidence supporting this theory has been found so far ; further research into this matter is required .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15006.1 : </h3>~<s> The following is a transcript of the video footage recorded by the expedition team in 19██. </s>~<br><br><BEGIN LOG> [The helmet camera of one of the members of the expedition team is turned on.] [The camera shows a barren landscape covered in snow and ice.
