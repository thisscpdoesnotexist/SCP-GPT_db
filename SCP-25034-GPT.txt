This includes targets that are not in her direct line of sight or even outside the range of normal human vision.<br><br>When thrown, the chancla moves through space and time in order to reach its intended target, regardless of distance or obstacles.

It also appears that she does not require any special equipment or knowledge in order to utilize her power effectively.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-25034</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. She is to be provided with basic amenities and monitored by security personnel at all times. No personnel are allowed to interact with <i>SCP-25034</i> without prior approval from the site director.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-25034</i> attempts to use her ability outside of approved testing, she is to be immediately contained and restrained until further notice. Any personnel who witness such an occurrence are advised not to attempt any form of physical contact or interference, as this may result in injury or death due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-25034</i>'s power.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25034.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-25034</i> was observed using her ability to successfully hit a target located on the moon.
