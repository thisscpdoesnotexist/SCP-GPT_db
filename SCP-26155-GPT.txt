    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26155</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Safe</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26155 is an adult male horse (Equus ferus caballus) measuring approximately 5.5 feet at the withers with a chestnut coat and no remarkable external distinctions from non-anomalous members of its species. However, it exhibits extraordinary behavior and cognitive abilities that allow it to play the sport of volleyball at a level comparable to that of a skilled human player.</p>
<p>SCP-26155 understands the basic rules of volleyball and can serve, pass, set, and perform basic defensive maneuvers. Its anomalous characteristics become apparent when engaging in a volleyball match, where it demonstrates an uncanny ability to manipulate the ball despite lacking the usual appendage dexterity that humans possess. SCP-26155 uses its muzzle, neck, and occasionally its forelimbs to control and propel the volleyball, showing an understanding of the game that surpasses natural equine behavior.</p>
<p>Interestingly, SCP-26155 also exhibits heightened social and communication skills when interacting with humans, seemingly able to comprehend human speech and non-verbal cues to a limited extent. Despite its proficiency in the game and amicable disposition, SCP-26155 does not showcase any other anomalous properties or abilities.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-26155's containment procedures are relatively lax due to its safe classification and cooperative nature. It is kept in a standard equine containment unit within Site-██ with environmental conditions that mimic those of a comfortable outdoor equine habitat. The containment area includes a full-sized volleyball court for recreational and research purposes.</p>
<p>SCP-26155 requires standard care for a horse of its breed and age, including a balanced diet, veterinary check-ups, and regular exercise. Interaction with SCP-26155 is allowed under supervision for the purpose of enrichment and conducting approved experiments. At least two (2) personnel trained in equine care and handling must be available at all times.</p>
<p>To minimize stress to SCP-26155, personnel interacting with the specimen are to approach it in a non-threatening manner, and any competitive matches should be carried out in a playful and non-aggressive tone. Any changes in behavior or health are to be reported immediately to the attending veterinarian and the SCP-26155 research head.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-26155 was discovered at a small farm in ████████, after a series of viral videos featuring "the volleyball-playing horse" gained significant attention on social media platforms. A field agent embedded in local law enforcement was dispatched to investigate and confirmed the validity of SCP-26155's abilities. The Foundation secured SCP-26155 through standard containment protocols and administered Class-B amnestics to the previous owners and witnesses involved.</p>
