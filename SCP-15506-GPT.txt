Food and water are to be provided as needed.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15506</i> is a group of seven or eight dogs, genetically identical to the American Pit Bull Terrier. <i>SCP-15506</i> instances are capable of vocalization and will respond to their names if called.<br><br><i>SCP-15506</i> was discovered after reports of a pack of stray dogs attacking civilians in ██████, Texas were reported to local authorities. Foundation agents embedded in the police force were able to capture an instance before it could be destroyed by responding officers. The instance was transported back to Site-██ for containment and study.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15506.1 : </h3> ██/██/████<br><br>While in containment, <i>SCP-15506</i> was given a meal of standard dog food. When the instance finished eating, it produced a large amount of feces and urinated on the floor of its cell. The feces and urine were both found to be composed entirely of human teeth. Further testing has revealed that all instances of <i>SCP-15506</i> produce teeth when fed any sort of meat product or bone meal.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15506.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████, owner of <i>SCP-15506</i><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>██████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b>██████: </b>███████. I own those dogs. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>You own all of them? <br><br><b>██████: </b>Yeah, they're my dogs. I got a call from the pound a few days ago saying that they were found in my yard and that I had to pick them up or pay for their care or something like that, so I came down here and did it real quick and brought them home again, but then when we let 'em out back in our yard they just ran off into the woods behind our house! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's very interesting… Can you tell me where you got these dogs? <br><br><b>██████: </b>Me and my wife went to this shelter over in Austin about two weeks ago because she wanted a dog after her cat died last year, so we went there to get one but there was only one left which was this big black pit bull puppy with white paws who didn't have any collar on him at all so we figured he must've gotten lost from his owners or something like that so we took him home with us because he seemed nice enough even though he was really hyperactive but then after a couple of days he started getting sick real bad and wouldn't eat anything at all no matter what we tried feeding him until finally he just stopped moving altogether which is why we called the vet who said it looked like some kind of weird sickness or something before telling us to bring him back here for disposal if possible otherwise just dumping his body somewhere if not since apparently nobody wants dead animals anymore either way which is why when those other six showed up on our property earlier today I figured they had probably been dumped as well by whoever owned them before deciding not to take care of them anymore since apparently nobody wants garbage anymore either way too [REDACTED] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The remains of an instance of <i>SCP-15506</i> were delivered by Foundation agents posing as animal control officers shortly after this interview concluded while <i>SCP-15506</i> itself was allowed to remain at its owner's residence under surveillance until further notice due to its lack of anomalous properties beyond producing teeth from feces .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15506.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15506-A - ██/██/████<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15506</i>-1, <i>SCP-15506</i>-2, <i>SCP-15506</i>-3, <i>SCP-15506</i>-4, and SCP 155061. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Each instance of SCP 155061 was placed in a separate containment cell. Each instance was provided with a bowl of raw chicken breast and allowed to eat until full. <br><br><b>Result: </b>All instances produced teeth composed entirely of human enamel. <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that the teeth are being produced from the cells that produce hair in canines . Further testing is needed to determine if this is true for all instances of 15506 or just those used in this experiment . -Dr. ████████ Experiment 15506 A -2 - ██/██/████ <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Four instances of SCP 155061 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Instances were placed into separate containment cells and provided with bowls containing dog food mixed with bone meal <br><br><b>Result: </b>Instances began eating their food normally; however, after two minutes each instance vomited up a large quantity of human teeth composed completely out of enamel <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>The fact that the teeth were made out completely out human enamel indicates they were produced by the body rather than being carried as a parasite or other organism . Further testing is required to determine how this process occurs .<br><br></div>
