It is to be monitored at all times by no less than two armed guards, who are to remain outside of <i>SCP-15296</i>'s line of sight at all times. Any personnel who have seen <i>SCP-15296</i>'s face are not allowed within a 50 meter radius of the entity, and must wear protective goggles at all times while in the vicinity of <i>SCP-15296</i>.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15296</i> is a humanoid entity of unknown origin. It has been observed to be able to move at speeds exceeding that of any known human, and has demonstrated the ability to teleport. <i>SCP-15296</i> can also create illusions, which it uses as a method of distraction while it attacks its prey.<br><br><i>SCP-15296</i> will actively hunt down and kill any human it encounters in the vicinity, regardless of whether or not they have seen <i>SCP-15296</i>'s face. It is unknown if <i>SCP-15296</i> can see through its own illusions or if it simply relies on them for tracking purposes; however, in all recorded instances, when an individual sees <i>SCP-15296</i>'s face directly (either by looking at an illusion directly or by seeing through one), they are chased and killed by <i>SCP-15296</i> within 5 minutes . See Addendum 152962 for more information on how individuals who have seen <i>SCP-15296</i>'s face react after being exposed to one of its illusions.<br><br><i>SCP-15296</i> was originally discovered in ██████, California after reports were made about several deaths occurring within the town over the course of two weeks with no apparent cause; these deaths were later found to be caused by <i>SCP-15296</i>. After Foundation agents arrived on scene and engaged with the entity , they managed to detain it using standard methods; however, upon transporting it back to Site 19 via helicopter , a malfunction occurred during takeoff due to <i>"the turbulence"</i> that caused both pilots' necks [REDACTED] resulting in their deaths and causing both themselves and Agent ████ (who was riding shotgun) [REDACTED] resulting in his death as well.[REDACTED]. The helicopter crashed into a nearby forested area whereupon contact with Site 19 was lost until recovery teams arrived on scene three days later . Upon arrival at Site 19 , personnel discovered that all electronic devices within ten meters around where the helicopter had crashed had been destroyed due to <i>"electrical interference"</i>. All attempts made since then regarding either repairing such devices or removing them from this radius have failed . Attempts made regarding removing said items from this radius were successful; however upon attempting repair work on said items outside this radius resulted in each device exploding violently after being handled for less than five seconds . Any attempt made regarding retrieving these items from their now permanent location inside this radius ended up failing when another item would explode instead . These items are currently classified as anomalous objects under Euclid classification following Incident Report 152962A1:<br><br><h3>Addendum 15296.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-15296</i> was originally discovered in ██████, California after reports were made about several deaths occurring within the town over the course of two weeks with no apparent cause; these deaths were later found to be caused by <i>SCP-15296</i>.

Are we still connected to HQ? Why can't we see each other through our cameras if we're not even connected to HQ anymore? Dr. ███: We aren't sure what caused it yet; however, yes, we are still connected to HQ but no one is responding at all – they might be busy with something else right now so please bear with us for now while we try to figure out what happened here – can you tell me about your experience during the crash please ? <br><br><b>████████: </b>Well… it's hard for me to remember exactly what happened but everything just went dark suddenly and then I woke up here - wait… how did you know my name is- oh god… oh god why?!

IT SHOULD'VE BEEN ME INSTEAD OF HIM DAMNIT!!! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject immediately proceeded towards <i>SCP-15296</i>'s containment cell upon being released from interview room before he could be restrained by security personnel present there , screaming incoherently about how 'it should've been him'. After breaching containment successfully , subject proceeded towards <i>SCP-15296</i>'s containment cell before collapsing onto its floor shortly afterwards due to unknown reasons ; autopsy reports revealed severe internal bleeding throughout his body which led into his heart failure shortly after he collapsed onto <i>SCP-15296</i>'s floor . Further investigation revealed traces of blood belonging neither subject nor <i>SCP-15296</i> near its containment cell door which lead back outside Site 19 perimeter fence line; further investigation has shown no signs of 'anomalous electrical interference' occurring anywhere near Site 19 perimeter fence line since Incident Report 152962A1 occurred , suggesting that whatever caused it may have also contributed towards subject suffering severe internal bleeding throughout his body shortly after breaching <i>SCP-15296</i>'s containment cell successfully without any external damage done whatsoever against subject himself prior or postmortem - See Addendum 15295 for more information regarding possible connection between these two incidents<br><br><h3>Addendum 15296.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 15296-1<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-Class personnel are to be told that they are taking part in a test regarding the effects of <i>SCP-15296</i>'s illusions. They are then to be exposed to one of <i>SCP-15296</i>'s illusions and their reactions observed. The D-Class is then to be given a standard psychological evaluation after being debriefed.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon exposure, D-class personnel reacted with terror, believing that <i>SCP-15296</i> was in the room with them, despite it not actually being present at any time during the experiment. The subject was then informed that it had been exposed to an illusion; however, despite this knowledge, they still believed that they were being chased by <i>SCP-15296</i> until informed otherwise by testing staff . After being debriefed , the subject was administered Class B amnestics and released from Foundation custody .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears as though although subjects believe themselves not to have seen SCP - 15 296's face , their brains still register its presence due to some sort of post - illusionary effect . Further experimentation regarding this is needed before any further conclusions can be made . Experiment #: 15 296 - 2 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██ / █ / 20██ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A single D - class personnel will enter a room containing two chairs and one table ; on said table will be placed an open laptop displaying footage from previous tests involving SCP - 15 296 , along with several newspapers detailing recent reports of deaths in nearby towns over the course of two weeks ( all details mentioned within these reports will match those found on file ) along with several other objects which have been confirmed as non - anomalous through extensive testing ; also included on this table will be a standard firearm loaded with nonlethal rubber bullets along with several magazines for said firearm . Once inside , the door will close behind them and locked via keypad ; upon doing so , no further means of opening said door or leaving said room shall exist aside from using force or exiting through one window located at ground level ( which has been boarded up ). No electronic devices shall exist within ten meters around where this experiment takes place except for surveillance cameras recording everything occurring inside said room . After ten minutes pass without incident , agents outside monitoring these cameras shall enter via another window located at ground level ( which has also been boarded up ) and attempt communication via intercom system installed within room prior to test commencing; if no response is obtained after three attempts , agents are authorized use lethal force against entity if deemed necessary. If any response is obtained from either party involved in experiment after first three attempts made by agents outside monitoring area occur or upon hearing gunshots fired inside area where experiment takes place [REDACTED] resulting in his death as well.[REDACTED]. The helicopter crashed into a nearby forested area whereupon contact with Site 19 was lost until recovery teams arrived on scene three days later . Upon arrival at Site 19 , personnel discovered that all electronic devices within ten meters around where the helicopter had crashed had been destroyed due to <i>"electrical interference"</i>. All attempts made since then regarding either repairing such devices or removing them from this radius have failed . Attempts made regarding removing said items from this radius were successful; however upon attempting repair work on said items outside this radius resulted in each device exploding violently after being handled for less than five seconds . Any attempt made regarding retrieving these items from their now permanent location inside this radius ended up failing when another item would explode instead . These items are currently classified as anomalous objects under Euclid classification following Incident Report <br><br><b>152962A1: </b>Addendum <br><br><b>152962A1: </b>On ██/██/20██, Dr. Klein attempted retrieval efforts concerning aforementioned items using robotic drones equipped wth electromagnets attached onto each drone's underside; however before retrieval could occur [REDACTED] resulting in his death.[REDACTED]. Drone used during retrieval operation was destroyed shortly thereafter when another drone exploded near it while attempting retrieval efforts resulted in yet another explosion occurring near aforementioned drone causing both itself and yet another drone exploding violently shortly thereafter resulting into [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting into [DATA EXPUNGED].
