<h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-202-GPT</i>

<h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe

<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> **********SACRED**********

<i>SCP-202-GPT</i> is to be kept in an airtight container at all times. This container should be located in a room with controlled temperature and humidity, such as a standard Safe class containment chamber. The object should be checked on daily for signs of degradation and/or any attempt of interference from unauthorized personnel or other anomalies. **********SACRED**********


<h3>Description:</h3> **********SACRED**********

<i>SCP-202-GPT</i> is a regular yellow banana, of the Musa acuminate species. The object displays no anomalous properties until it has been peeled and then placed on any solid surface. It is at this point when <i>SCP-202-GPT</i> begins to demonstrate its anomalous properties . **********SACRED********** <i>SCP-202-GPT</i> can be manipulated by applying pressure on its exposed surfaces, causing the banana's mass to redistribute itself evenly between all of its exposed surfaces. The density of SCP-202 appears to be variable, depending on the amount of body contact it has with whatever surface(s) it was placed on. *********SACRED***************


<h3>SCP 202 GPT Update:</h3> Ongoing research into the effects of long term skin contact with spp 202 Gpt has resulted in numerous requests for testing involving exposure for extended periods using various materials such as latex gloves, plastic wrap and foam tubing among others.. This request is currently pending O5 approval but until such time as permission is granted all testing involving spp 202 gpt must be conducted using approved forged steel implements or other nonporus material that does not come into direct skin contact with subject..

<h3>Discovery:</h3> <i>SCP-202-GPT</i> was discovered in ████████, Brazil, in [DATA EXPUNGED]. It was found mostly by accident, when the Foundation intercepted a shipment of bananas from the Amazon rainforest. After some minor testing with D-Class personnel, it was deemed safe and placed into storage.

<h3>A note to anyone who is reading this:</h3> I thought that maybe if people could actually read these things before they were put up here that they might actually make sense or at least not scare the pants off of everyone who has to work with them. So if you're just looking for a good scare or a heart attack then look somewhere else but if you're really interested in learning about anomalies without resorting to common bullshit like "INFORMATION REDACTED" then stick around because we can't guarantee your safety here but we can guarantee your sanity..

<h3>Recovery:</h3> SCP-555 was found in the ███████ river in ██████, Montana. It was fished out by local authorities who believed it to be a normal salmon and turned it over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for study. It was then transferred into Foundation custody after Agent Daniel O'Brien intercepted an e-mail from the U.S.F&W Sysops discussing it's anomalous nature with one of their interns, Dr . Meadows..
