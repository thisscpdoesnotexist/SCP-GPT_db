<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24024 is  a song that makes you lose weight… very quickly… and with no limit…</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24024<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24024</i> is a song composed of two parts, both written in an unknown language. The first part consists of a male vocalist singing the melody and lyrics, while the second part is instrumental. When played, any listener exposed to <i>SCP-24024</i> will experience an accelerated rate of weight loss, with no known limit or end.<br><br>The amount of weight lost depends on how long the subject has been exposed to the song; after approximately one hour, subjects have been observed to lose up to 10% of their body mass in a single day. Subjects also report feeling lightheaded and weak during this time period. After cessation of exposure to <i>SCP-24024</i>, subjects regain their original body mass within 24 hours without any lasting physical effects or changes in metabolism rate.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24024</i> is to be kept in a secure audio file on a dedicated computer at Site-██. Access to the file must be restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and all personnel exposed to <i>SCP-24024</i> must undergo psychological evaluation before and after exposure.<br><br>In addition, any attempts by unauthorized persons to access the file are to be blocked immediately by security staff.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24024.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of exposure to <i>SCP-24024</i> on non-human subjects. Two chimpanzees were exposed to <i>SCP-24024</i> for two hours and observed for any changes in behavior or physical condition.<br><br>Results showed that both subjects experienced accelerated weight loss at an even faster rate than human subjects, losing up to 20% of their body mass within 24 hours. After cessation of exposure, both chimps regained their original body mass within 48 hours without any lasting physical effects or changes in metabolism rate.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24024.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> So, what can you tell me about this song?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> Well, it's a strange one. We don't know where it came from or who wrote it, but we do know that when someone listens to the song they experience an accelerated rate of weight loss with no known limit or end. It's quite remarkable really; we've never seen anything like it before.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Are there any other effects?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> Subjects report feeling lightheaded and weak during this time period, but after cessation of exposure to the song they regain their original body mass within 24 hours without any lasting physical effects or changes in metabolism rate. We're still studying the effects of <i>SCP-24024</i>, but so far it appears to be a harmless phenomenon.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24024.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-91234<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-24024</i> for a period of one hour. Subject was monitored throughout the experiment for changes in weight and physical condition. After the hour had elapsed, subject's exposure to <i>SCP-24024</i> was terminated and he was allowed to rest for 24 hours before further testing could be conducted.<br><b><br>Results:</b> During the first hour of exposure, subject lost 5% of his body mass. He reported feeling lightheaded and weak during this time period. 24 hours after cessation of exposure, subject had regained all lost mass with no lasting physical effects or changes in metabolism rate observed.</div>
