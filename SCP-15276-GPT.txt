<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15276</i> is  Donald Duck and Elmo</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15276</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15276</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. <i>SCP-15276</i> is to be fed three meals a day, with the meal times being staggered by no less than two hours. <i>SCP-15276</i>'s containment cell is to be monitored at all times via camera and any attempts at removing instances of <i>SCP-15276</i> from their original works are to be documented and reported immediately .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15276</i> is a male human. <i>SCP-15276</i> has the appearance of a Caucasian male in his late teens or early twenties. <i>SCP-15276</i> is 2.12 meters tall and weighs approximately 87 kilograms.<br><br><i>SCP-15276</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with any form of media, including but not limited to: television programs, films, books, magazines and internet videos. The effect of this contact manifests itself in two ways:<br><br>Any characters appearing within the media will be replaced by an instance of <i>SCP-15276</i> . This instance will be dressed in clothing appropriate for the setting and situation depicted within the media (see Addendum 15276-1). All instances of <i>SCP-15276</i> are aware that they are fictional characters within a piece of fiction and will behave accordingly (see Addendum 15276-2). Instances of <i>SCP-15276</i> do not appear to age or die unless removed from their respective pieces of media by means other than viewing (see Experiment Log 152762). If an instance is removed from its respective piece of media then it will begin to suffer physical deterioration until death occurs as per standard human biology. The time taken for this process to occur depends on how long an instance has been outside its respective piece of media but appears to be accelerated if placed back into its original work (See Experiment Log 152763). Instances have been observed attempting to return themselves into their original works after being removed by placing themselves in front or behind cameras filming said works (See Incident Report 152764) . How they accomplish this task is currently unknown as no instances have been observed using any kind communication device nor do they seem capable of leaving their current location without assistance from Foundation personnel . Any attempts at removing instances from their original work via editing methods results in them reappearing shortly afterwards unharmed . It should also be noted that all attempts at destroying these works have resulted in them reappearing unharmed shortly afterwards . See Addendum 15277 for further information on reanimation events caused by these phenomena .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15276.1 : </h3>【ACCESS SCP:/15276/files/DOCUMENT-15276-1】<br><br><h3>Addendum 15276.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS SCP:/15276/files/DOCUMENT-15276-2】<br><br><h3>Addendum 15276.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log <br><br><b>152762: </b>The following experiments were conducted to determine the effects of removing an instance of <i>SCP-15276</i> from its original work.<br><br>Test #: 1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15276</i>-1 (<i>SCP-15276</i>) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15276</i> was removed from a copy of <i>"The Adventures of Tintin"</i> and placed in a standard humanoid containment cell. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Instance remained conscious for approximately thirty minutes before expiring.
