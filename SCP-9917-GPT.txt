I'm going to ask you a few questions about your involvement with <i>SCP-9917</i>. <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Okay… I guess… Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>You were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and assault after you were caught plotting the assassination of [REDACTED]. Care to explain yourself? █████████ is silent for several seconds before responding. 【Subject】: [DATA EXPUNGED] Agent █████████ pauses for several seconds before continuing his questioning. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>So you're saying that someone else said this? And that they did it without your consent? (At this point, subject's eyes widen in surprise.) <br><br><b>Subject: </b>No! No one said anything! It's just something that I thought up all by myself! (Subject begins sweating profusely.) <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Oh god… what have I done? What have I done?! (Subject begins crying hysterically) [END LOG] Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being informed of the nature of <i>SCP-9917</i> and its capabilities, subject was transported back to his cell at Site-19 where he remains under observation until further notice from Drs C████ and R████<br><br><h3>Addendum 9917.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test A: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-7242, a convicted murderer.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is asked to describe their last meal. <br><br><b>Result: </b><i>"I'm not sure what you mean by that. I had some corn flakes this morning."</i> <br><br><b>Analysis: </b><i>SCP-9917</i> appears to be unable to determine the future of people who are aware of its existence. Test B: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-5341, a convicted rapist.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is asked what he did on his last day of freedom before being incarcerated for rape and murder. Result:<i>"I went out with my friends and got really drunk."</i> Analysis:<i>"I went out with my friends and got really drunk"</i> was recorded by <i>SCP-9917</i> prior to the test, but could not determine how it would be used in conversation until after it was said by the subject. This suggests that <i>SCP-9917</i> can only record information that is said aloud by a subject within earshot of an active recording device, rather than telepathically or from memory . Test C: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 5341 , same as previous test . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous test . <br><br><b>Result: </b><i>" I went out with my friends and got really drunk ."</i> <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>See above .<br><br></div>
