Turns out its a giant plant and not a lizard though.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17603<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17603</i> is a large, carnivorous plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. <i>SCP-17603</i> has been observed to exhibit traits similar to those of the mythological hydra; it has multiple heads and necks which can regenerate when severed.<br><br>The primary body of <i>SCP-17603</i> consists of a single stem approximately 3 meters in diameter and 10 meters in height, with multiple branches extending from its base. Each branch terminates in a large flower head, each containing two or more mouths with sharpened teeth capable of biting prey up to 1 meter in size. When disturbed or threatened, <i>SCP-17603</i> will rapidly extend its necks towards any nearby creatures and attempt to bite them with its jaws.<br><br>In addition, <i>SCP-17603</i> is capable of regenerating any severed limbs within 24 hours if given access to sufficient nutrients such as soil and sunlight. This regeneration process appears to be accelerated by the presence of living organisms near the stump; this suggests that some form of symbiosis may exist between <i>SCP-17603</i> and other nearby life forms.<br><br><i>SCP-17603</i>'s anomalous properties appear limited solely to its regenerative capabilities; no other unusual behavior has been observed thus far.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17603</i> is to be contained in a large greenhouse located at Site-██. The greenhouse must be kept at a temperature of 25°C and humidity of 70%, with regular watering and fertilization. Any personnel entering the containment area must wear protective clothing, as <i>SCP-17603</i> has been known to attempt to bite any living creatures that enter its vicinity.<br><br>In addition, all personnel are prohibited from attempting to sever any part of <i>SCP-17603</i>; doing so could potentially cause an uncontrolled regeneration event which could result in the destruction of the containment facility.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17603.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ due to a malfunction in the greenhouse's cooling system. During the incident, <i>SCP-17603</i> was observed to have grown an additional two heads and necks, bringing its total number of heads up to twelve. All personnel were successfully evacuated before any further damage could be done.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17603.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17603</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a brief interview was conducted with <i>SCP-17603</i> in order to gain further insight into its behavior. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17603</i>. Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17603</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell me why you regenerate your limbs?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17603</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any other abilities?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17603</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Is there anything else you can tell me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17603</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Thank you for your time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17603.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to test the regenerative capabilities of <i>SCP-17603</i>. A single branch was severed from the main body and placed in a separate container with soil and water. After 24 hours, the severed limb had fully regenerated itself into a new flower head identical to those present on the main body.</div>
