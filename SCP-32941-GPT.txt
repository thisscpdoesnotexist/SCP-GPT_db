    <h3>Item #: SCP-32941 - "The Inconvenient Truth"</h3>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-32941 is a powerful and highly contagious memetic agent that affects individuals exposed to information that could potentially disrupt or destabilize the foundational understanding and nature of our universe. Infected subjects (hereafter designated SCP-32941-1) will become aware of truths about reality so disturbing that they may cause psychological trauma, societal disruption, or even alterations in the fabric of reality itself.</p>
<p>SCP-32941 appears to act as a safeguard or filter for information considered too dangerous or destabilizing for human consciousness or reality to accommodate. Infected individuals become carriers of these truths but are simultaneously affected by an array of mental inhibitors that prevent them from comprehending, communicating, or acting upon the knowledge they possess.</p>
<p>The cognitive dissonance created by the possession of significant yet inaccessible knowledge leads to severe mental distress in SCP-32941-1 subjects. To date, there has been no successful attempt to reverse the cognitive lockdown imposed by SCP-32941.</p>
<p>As the nature of SCP-32941 interferes with reliable documentation and containment, its origin, initial discovery, and propagation methods are largely unknown. However, it is clear that SCP-32941 can spread via any communication medium that is capable of conveying deeply disturbing truths about reality, including but not limited to speech, writing, digital media, and possibly even non-verbal communication.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-32941 necessitates a containment strategy referred to as Protocol "Ignorance is Bliss." Any evidence of SCP-32941 infection or transmission must be immediately reported to Mobile Task Force Psi-9 ("Thought Police") for intervention.</p>
<ol>
<li>All knowledge of SCP-32941 is to be classified at the highest security level, with access restricted to personnel of Level 4 clearance or higher who have undergone extensive psychological screening.</li>
<li>Research on SCP-32941 requires O5 Council authorization and is to be conducted in a hermetically-sealed information quarantine environment at Site-███, nicknamed "The Echo Chamber."</li>
<li>Individuals diagnosed with SCP-32941 infection are to be quarantined in soundproof holding cells at Site-███. All communication with SCP-32941-1 subjects is forbidden unless conducted for approved experimental purposes.</li>
<li>Amnestic treatment has proven only partially effective in mitigating SCP-32941's spread, as it is not capable of erasing the deeper memetic effects. Therefore, when appropriate, a full-frontal lobotomy may be considered as a measure of last resort.</li>
<li>Any media or technology suspected of transmitting SCP-32941 is to be incinerated, and digital traces are to be expunged with specialized memetic scrubbing software developed by the Foundation's IT security teams.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Report 32941-A</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, a significant breach occurred when Dr. █████, a leading researcher on SCP-32941, succumbed to the effects of the anomaly, resulting in the dissemination of sensitive information within Site-███. The affected cohort displayed immediate psychological breakdown and self-destructive behavior, necessitating the deployment of Protocol "Silent Night," resulting in a complete information sterilization of the site and the administration of Class-X amnestics to all personnel.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Logs</h3>
<h4>Experiment 32941-E1</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To understand the mechanism by which SCP-32941 inhibits communication of the hazardous knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-32941-1 subject was exposed to the linguistic isolation technique for 30 days in an attempt to force an alternative method of communication.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject's mental state deteriorated significantly. No alternative communication methods were observed. Subject showed signs of extreme frustration and eventually became unresponsive.</p>
<h4>Experiment 32941-E2</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine if SCP-32941's effect could be transmitted through artistic expression.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> An SCP-32941-1 artist was provided with art supplies and allowed to create freely under observation.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The artwork produced was abstract and emotionally disturbing but contained no discernible information about the avoided truths. The art subsequently caused SCP-32941 symptoms in D-Class personnel exposed to it, necessitating their termination.</p>
<h4>Experiment 32941-E3</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the possibility of non-verbal communication transmission of SCP-32941.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Two SCP-32941-1 subjects were placed in a room together without any means of verbal or written communication. Monitoring equipment was used to observe any memetic exchanges through gestures or non-verbal cues.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The subjects displayed an innate reluctance or inability to interact on a level that would transmit SCP-32941. Subjects remained isolated in their behavior, avoiding any actions that might suggest shared understanding.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: O5 Council Directive</h3>
<p>Given the insidious and pervasive threat posed by SCP-32941, the O5 Council has issued a directive that any research or containment efforts prioritize the minimization of knowledge proliferation about SCP-32941 itself. The containment of the anomaly is secondary to the preservation of overall stability within the Foundation and the global population at large. Ignorance must be maintained to ensure the continued existence of current reality paradigms.</p>
