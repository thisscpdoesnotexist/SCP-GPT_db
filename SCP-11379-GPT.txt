Agents are to remain within 100 meters of <i>SCP-11379</i> at all times and are not to enter 117939 under any circumstances.<br><br>If an agent enters 117939, they are to be considered lost and the Foundation is not responsible for their safety or recovery.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11379</i> is an elevator shaft in the ████████ building in █████████, ██. The shaft has no top or bottom, and is infinite in length. <i>SCP-11379</i> was discovered by Agent [REDACTED] on a routine patrol of the building.<br><br><i>SCP-11379</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when any human being enters <i>SCP-11379</i>'s elevator and presses any button other than the <i>"O"</i> button (designated <i>SCP-11379</i>-1). When this occurs, all humans within a 100 meter radius will perceive that person to be missing for approximately 1 minute. During this time, it is believed that the subject teleports to an alternate dimension (designated <i>SCP-11379</i>-2) where they are killed by an unknown entity after approximately 5 minutes of exposure to it. At least one instance of <i>SCP-11379</i> has been recorded where a subject pressed the <i>"O"</i> button instead of one of the other buttons; however, no anomalous effects were observed during this test except for increased levels of stress among personnel present at Site 19 during testing due to their proximity to D-[REDACTED].<br><br>SCP documents found on Agent [REDACTED]'s person revealed that he had been tracking reports about disappearances around [REDACTED] for several years prior to discovery; however, his superiors had ordered him not investigate further due to lack of evidence or leads regarding these disappearances and because they were considered low priority compared with more pressing matters at hand. These files also revealed that Agent [REDACTED] was aware he would be exposed as well if he did not act quickly enough upon discovering 117979; thus, he activated his emergency beacon before entering 117979 himself so Foundation agents could locate him while attempting containment procedures on 117979 itself. Unfortunately, before containment could be fully established Agent [REDACTED] disappeared from sight into 117939 along with two additional agents who entered 113939 after him but failed to escape successfully themselves before becoming lost within its extradimensional space .<br><br><h3>Addendum 11379.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ████████, the building's owner<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████████ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent [REDACTED] </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted following the discovery of <i>SCP-11379</i>. [REDACTED] had been in contact with Agent [REDACTED] prior to his disappearance and was aware of his intentions to investigate 117939. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████? I'd like to ask you some questions about your building if that's alright with you. <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Certainly, sonny! What can I do for ya? Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Well sir, it seems that one of our agents discovered something rather… odd in your building recently and we were hoping you could tell us more about it? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Oh yeah! The elevator shaft! I forgot all about it until now… It used to be a normal elevator shaft but then someone decided they wanted a bigger office so they closed up the top floor and made it into an office instead! But then when they tried to use the elevator again they found out that there wasn't enough room for an elevator car on the top floor so they just left it there as is! So what is this thing anyway? Is it dangerous or something? Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Well sir, we're not sure yet; however, we believe that someone may have been trapped inside at some point in time but managed escape before being lost within its extradimensional space forever . We're currently trying everything within our power to locate them and bring them back safely; however, we may need your help if these efforts fail . Would you be willing to assist us in any way possible if this occurs? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Of course sonny! Just say the word and I'll help ya out any way I can ! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 11379.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-5678<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to enter <i>SCP-11379</i> and press the <i>"O"</i> button. Subject is instructed to exit immediately after pressing the button.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon entering 117939, subject pressed the <i>"O"</i> button, then exited elevator shaft without incident. No anomalous effects were observed during this test except for increased levels of stress among personnel present at Site 19 due to their proximity to D-[REDACTED].<br><br></div>
