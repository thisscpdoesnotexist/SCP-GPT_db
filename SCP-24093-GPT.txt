<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24093 is  what I like to call "nouveau deadly"</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24093<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24093</i> is a phenomenon that causes any non-living object to become dangerously lethal. Any object affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> will gain the ability to cause extreme physical harm, with possible fatal consequences.<br><br>The range of objects affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> is unpredictable and seemingly random, ranging from small items such as paper clips or pencils, to large objects such as chairs or vehicles. The only commonality between all affected objects is their sudden and unexpected lethality when handled or interacted with in any way.<br><br>When an object becomes affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> it will remain deadly for an indefinite amount of time until it eventually reverts back to its original state. This process can take anywhere from seconds to days depending on the size and complexity of the object in question. It should be noted that no matter how long an object remains dangerous it will never become permanently lethal due to this effect; once reverted, the danger posed by the item has been eliminated completely.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> All objects affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> must be contained in a secure containment locker and monitored at all times. Any personnel interacting with these objects must wear appropriate protective gear and take extreme caution when handling them.<br><br>Any object suspected of being affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> should be reported to the Site Director immediately, who will then decide on the best course of action for containing it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24093.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred in the Site-██ containment wing. During the incident, several objects affected by <i>SCP-24093</i> were discovered and contained. It is suspected that these objects had been exposed to an unknown anomalous phenomenon prior to the breach, though no further information has been uncovered at this time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24093.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████, what can you tell us about <i>SCP-24093</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Well, it's a very strange phenomenon that we haven't been able to fully understand or explain yet. What we do know is that any non-living object can become dangerously lethal when affected by <i>SCP-24093</i>, and the range of objects affected is unpredictable. We've seen everything from paper clips to cars become deadly in an instant, so it's important for everyone in the area to be aware of this phenomenon and take appropriate precautions when handling any potentially dangerous items.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24093.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><br>In an effort to better understand the effects of <i>SCP-24093</i>, a series of experiments were conducted. The results are as follows:<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> A standard paper clip was placed in a containment locker and monitored for any changes in behavior. After several hours, the paper clip began to vibrate rapidly before becoming incredibly sharp and dangerous to handle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that <i>SCP-24093</i> had taken effect on the object.<br><b><br>Experiment 2:</b> An ordinary chair was placed in a containment locker and monitored for any changes in behavior. After several hours, the chair suddenly became incredibly heavy and difficult to move or lift without proper protective gear; upon further inspection it was determined that <i>SCP-24093</i> had taken effect on the object.</div>
