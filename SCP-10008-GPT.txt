The server is to be monitored by two security cameras and one microphone at all times. Any personnel who attempt to log into <i>SCP-10008</i> are required to do so from a separate computer than the one they use for any other Foundation related business, and must wait 24 hours before attempting again.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10008</i> is a Minecraft server that was created by Dr. ████ on █/██/████. The server had no anomalous properties at this time, and was used by the foundation for testing purposes.<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-10008</i> gained its anomalous properties when Dr. ████ entered the server with his account to test out a new feature he had been working on for several days in order to make it more realistic and interactive between players. Upon entering the game, <i>SCP-10008</i> began to display strange messages in chat that were not typed by any of the players or staff members of the foundation who were present at this time (See Addendum 10008-1). After approximately five minutes of these messages appearing in chat, all users logged off without warning or explanation as well as Dr. ████ himself (see Addendum 10008-2). Personnel who attempted to log back into <i>SCP-10008</i> found themselves unable to do so until one month later when they discovered that they could log back into their accounts if they waited exactly 24 hours after logging off before attempting again (See Addendum 10008-3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10008.1 : </h3><br><br><b><i>SCP-10008</i>: </b><i>"Do you know who I am?"</i><br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b><i>"No, should I?"</i><br><br><b><i>SCP-10008</i>: </b><i>"I don't think so."</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 10008.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ C██████, a member of the foundation who was present during <i>SCP-10008</i>'s first activation.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████<br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>█████ C██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 10008.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92321<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-92321 is to log into <i>SCP-10008</i> with his account and attempt to play the game. After 24 hours, he will be removed from the server and questioned on any unusual experiences while playing.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon entering <i>SCP-10008</i>, D-92321 found himself in a small room made of cobblestone with a single wooden door at the opposite end of the room. The door was locked by an iron bar that had been placed through two holes in it, one on each side of the door. After attempting to remove this bar multiple times, D-92321 was able to successfully open it after several minutes and proceeded through another wooden door into a large stone hallway that led down several flights of stairs before opening up into a large cavernous area filled with lava pools and obsidian pillars. At this point, all communications were lost with D-92321 for approximately ten minutes until he reappeared behind his computer screen saying <i>"I don't know how I got back here."</i> When asked about what happened during those ten minutes, he said <i>"I don't know… I just remember walking down some stairs… Then there was lava everywhere…"</i><br><br></div>
