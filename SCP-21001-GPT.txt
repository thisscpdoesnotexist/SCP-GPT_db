<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21001 is  the beach that makes you old and young simultaneously, somehow</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21001<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21001</i> is a beach located in [REDACTED], Florida. The beach appears to be completely normal, with sand and water that appear to be of normal composition.<br><br>When individuals enter the area of <i>SCP-21001</i>, they experience an anomalous effect wherein they simultaneously age and de-age at a rapid rate. Individuals will experience both physical and mental changes as their age fluctuates between that of a young child and elderly adult. This process occurs rapidly, with individuals experiencing aging/deaging cycles lasting approximately one minute each cycle. During these cycles, individuals are capable of speaking coherently but are unable to move or take any action beyond basic communication due to the rapid nature of the changes occurring within their body.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-21001</i> can only be reversed when an individual leaves its area; once outside its boundaries all aging/deaging processes cease immediately upon exit from the area affected by <i>SCP-21001</i>'s anomalous properties. Those affected by <i>SCP-21001</i> have reported feeling disoriented after leaving its confines, often requiring several hours for them to regain full cognitive function following exposure to it's effects.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-21001</i> is to be contained within a standard security perimeter, with the area surrounding it being monitored by Foundation personnel. Access to <i>SCP-21001</i> is restricted and all individuals attempting to enter its area are to be detained and questioned regarding their intentions. Any individuals found affected by <i>SCP-21001</i>'s anomalous properties are to be given Class A amnestics and released.<br><br>In order to prevent public knowledge of <i>SCP-21001</i>, disinformation campaigns have been established in the local media outlets in order to spread false information about the beach's location and nature. Additionally, Foundation personnel embedded within local law enforcement agencies have been instructed to detain any individuals attempting unauthorized access into the containment zone for questioning before releasing them with Class B am<br><br><h3> Addendum 21001.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of individuals were observed entering the containment zone surrounding <i>SCP-21001</i>. Foundation personnel were dispatched to investigate and upon arriving at the beach they discovered that all individuals present had been affected by <i>SCP-21001</i>'s anomalous properties. All individuals were given Class A amnestics and released following questioning.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21001.2: </h3> Interview with affected individual<br><br>On ██/██/████, Foundation personnel conducted an interview with an individual who had been exposed to <i>SCP-21001</i>'s anomalous properties. The following is a transcript of the conversation that took place:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you please tell us what happened when you entered the beach?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> Well, I was just walking along the beach when suddenly I started feeling really strange. It felt like my body was changing, and then it all happened so fast. One minute I was an old man, then a young kid, then back to being an old man again. It was like my age kept flipping back and forth between the two extremes. I couldn't move or do anything, it was like my body was stuck in this loop.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Did you experience any other effects?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> Yes, I felt really disoriented and confused. It's hard to explain, but it felt like my mind wasn't quite there either. Like I was half here and half somewhere else at the same time.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any idea how long this lasted?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> I'm not sure, it felt like forever but it must have been only a few minutes. I'm just glad it stopped when I left the beach.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21001.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21001.1:</b> On ██/██/20██, D-92101 was instructed to enter the area of <i>SCP-21001</i> and observe its effects on them. Upon entering the beach, D-92101 began rapidly aging and deaging at a rate of approximately one minute per cycle. During this process, they were able to communicate with personnel observing their progress but were unable to move or take any action beyond basic communication due to the rapid nature of the changes occurring within their body. After two hours, D-92101 left <i>SCP-21001</i>'s area and immediately ceased all aging/deaging processes upon exiting it's boundaries. Following this experiment, D-92101 reported feeling disoriented for several hours before fully regaining cognitive function.</div>
