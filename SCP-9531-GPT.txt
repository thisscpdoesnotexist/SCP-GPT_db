All photos taken by <i>SCP-9531</i> will be uploaded to Reddit.com where they can be viewed by anyone who has access to the site.<br><br><i>SCP-9531</i> was recovered from an abandoned warehouse in ██████, UK after multiple people noticed their pictures on the website and reported it to local authorities. The whereabouts of whoever was in possession of <i>SCP-9531</i> before its discovery are unknown.<br><br>When a picture is taken with <i>SCP-951</i>, it will appear on ~~Reddit.com~~ [EXPUNGED] under the username ~~“Drumgunnison”~~ . When viewing these pictures, one cannot see what is in them until someone comments on them (However if someone does not comment within ten minutes of uploading then this does not apply). The 10 minute delay appears only in real time - when viewing older photographs or looking at previously posted comments one sees instantaneous results and replies as though events were occurring live . Comments made about pictures by users do not appear instantly; however once clicked upon they appear and disappear normally within 10 minutes flat - though this does not mean that people would have had time to view them first before they disappeared again as per normal behavior for Reddit posts , suggesting that there may be some sort of link between all past/future comments made regarding one photograph (see Addendum 9532). Thus far all found images depict scenes depicting major world events such as wars , acts of terrorism , natural disasters etc over the course of the next ten years , with no exception having been found yet . However due to limitations present within this effect users must wait several hours or days before seeing any post related replys that weren't already up when said user first views said post ; moreso than usual for Reddit which usually takes several hours for new replies if at all .<br> This limitation seems tied into whatever anomalous properties govern how future events depicted through <i>SCP-951</i> work : if potential viewers try to bypass this rule by using other methods such as emailing or mailing links directly or using bots programmed specifically for seeking out specific posts then whatever event shown will only be viewable at its actual moment unless viewed via normal means from thereon ; likewise even attempting bypassing this rule somehow doesn't stop new event's replies from appearing later<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-951</i> was discovered by Foundation agents in █████████, England . After repeated investigation of the location and properly tracing back who was responsible for the Reddit account , a recovery team of 15 agents were sent to secure <i>SCP-951</i> and evacuate it from the site. Agents found <i>SCP-951</i> on a table just past several crates marked as containing eggs without any sign of people or other lifeforms having been present in years present within them , with all lights turned off save for one lone spotlight shining down upon <i>SCP-951</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9531.1 :</h3> Excerpt from Interview Log 9531-A<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-951</i> (Drumgunnison)<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. █████████<br><br><br>Foreword: This interview was conducted by an unknown agent sent to interrogate <i>SCP-951</i> about its origins and nature .<br><br><Begin Log> <Begin Transcript> Dr.<br> █████████ : Alright, Drumgunnison , I've got a few questions for you regarding your camera there. How did you come into possession of it?<br> Drumgunnison : A man gave it to me . Dr.<br> █████████ : What was his name?<br> Drumgunnison : He didn't give me his name ; he just said that he needed me to take pictures of the future and that this camera could do it for him. He then left the room right after giving me the camera without saying another word or even turning on any lights or anything like that . After he left I took a picture of my foot - just as a test really - but when I looked at it there was a small fire in my living room , which had been previously empty, going out in one corner ! It eventually died down after several hours but whenever I took pictures of random things nothing happened , so for all intents and purposes the ability worked only when recording what would happen several hours later . When people started finding out about this stuff online they started talkin' about how <i>"The Truth is coming"</i> and Jack Parsons so [REDACTED] said we should close off the site and put up [REDACTED] like we're some sort of secret society taking part in some kind of occult ritual . That's why we had to move operations here in order to keep track on whats goin' on with all these people getting scared about what's happening with our website's activity lately ; though apparently we might be getting new members soon because our superiors say they want more information stored inside here than ever before ! So far all I've done is keep watch over these cameras day after day since then…it gets old real fast looking at nothing but static twenty four seven while waiting anxiously for something interesting enough to appear ! <End Transcription><br> Closing Statement: [EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 9531.2 :</h3> Excerpt from Interview Log 9531-B<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-951</i> (Drumgunnison)<br><br><br>Interviewer: Agent █████<br><br><br>Foreword: This interview was conducted by Agent █████ with <i>SCP-951</i> after the events of Addendum 9531.1.<br><br><Begin Log> <Begin Transcript> Dr.<br> █████████ : Alright Drumgunnison , I've got a few questions for you regarding your camera there , and what's going on with the website.
