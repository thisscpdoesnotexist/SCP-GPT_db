<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27767, also known as "The Gambler's Melee," is a social phenomenon known to spontaneously manifest at locations where gambling activities are in progress, particularly underground or illegal venues. It entails a sudden and inexplicable surge of aggression among participants, which culminates in intense physical confrontations and atypical violent behavior. </p>
<p>The phenomenon does not require traditional triggers such as arguments or personal disputes to initiate. SCP-27767 typically manifests through a sudden shift in the behavior of a single participant (hereafter referred to as SCP-27767-A), who becomes overtly hostile towards other players and exhibits greatly enhanced physical capabilities. Within moments, these attributes spread to other individuals in the vicinity (hereafter referred to as SCP-27767-B instances), regardless of their previous disposition towards violence.</p>
<p>SCP-27767-A and SCP-27767-B instances show no regard for personal safety or wellbeing, engaging in hostilities until severe injury or death occurs. Victims of SCP-27767 are left with an altered state of mind, characterized by memory loss regarding the event, persistent aggressive tendencies, and an abnormal attraction to gambling scenarios — thereby potentially perpetuating the cycle of SCP-27767's occurrence.</p>
<p>To date, SCP-27767's origins, transmission vectors, and means of spontaneous initiation are unknown. Investigations remain ongoing to discern its origin, with hypotheses ranging from an anomalous object inducing these phenomena, to a virulent memetic agent that spreads via observational learning amongst gamblers.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to SCP-27767's unpredictable manifestation and the nature of its appearance in transient, illegal, and often secretive environments, permanent containment is currently deemed infeasible. Instead, the Foundation utilizes an array of undercover agents, monitoring systems, and informants within gambling circuits to detect potential outbreaks of SCP-27767.</p>
<p>Upon identification of an outbreak, Mobile Task Force Delta-5 ("High Rollers") is dispatched to the site with the primary objectives of suppressing the instance, administering amnestics as necessary, and retrieving affected individuals for research and rehabilitation. Gambling establishments found to experience recurrent instances of SCP-27767 are to be shut down, and owners/operators are to be detained for questioning and/or amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>The Foundation's research division is tasked with analyzing commonalities between SCP-27767 events in an effort to predict and prevent future outbreaks. The public is to remain unaware of SCP-27767's existence, with any leaked footage of events attributed to mass hysteria or local criminal activity. The Foundation's cybersecurity teams are to monitor and eliminate evidence of SCP-27767 from online sources.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Log 27767-I1</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██
<strong>Location:</strong> ██████, Nevada, USA</p>
<p>An underground poker tournament with approximately 150 attendees devolved into an SCP-27767 event, resulting in ██ fatalities and numerous injuries. MTF Delta-5 was dispatched to contain the incident. Post-event analysis identified one SCP-27767-A and ██ SCP-27767-B instances.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log 27767-E1</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To test the potential neutralizing effect of various common sedatives and amnestics on SCP-27767 instances.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Log:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>E1-01:</strong> Administration of a high-dose benzodiazepine. Result: SCP-27767-A instance remains aggressive, injury to administering agent noted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E1-02:</strong> Administration of a standard Foundation Class-B amnestic via aerosol. Result: Temporary confusion among instances, followed by a resumption of violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E1-03:</strong> Use of an electrical tranquilizer on SCP-27767-A. Result: SCP-27767-A instance incapacitated. Temporary cessation of hostility in SCP-27767-B instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Electrical tranquilization seems to be the most effective method of neutralizing SCP-27767-A and halting the spread of the phenomenon. Additional research is required to improve response protocols.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Recovered Document 27767-D1</h3>
<p><strong>Content Summary:</strong> A fragment of a journal, presumed to belong to a former SCP-27767-A instance, was retrieved. It contains multiple references to an "entity" that whispers to the subject during gambling sessions, inciting the individual to "break the chains of fortune through chaos." This document has sparked theories regarding a potential cognitohazardous or sentient entity involvement in the manifestation of SCP-27767.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Note:</strong> Enhanced cognitive screening and psychological profiling are now mandatory for subjects exposed to or involved in SCP-27767 incidents to assess for ongoing influence or control by an external entity.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Profile Update 27767-U1</h3>
<p>Ongoing analysis points towards a higher occurrence of SCP-27767 at locations with a history involving violence or criminal activities. Researchers theorize that such environments may be more susceptible to manifestation due to a residual "emotional imprint" or ongoing criminal intent among participants. Efforts to understand the connection between SCP-27767 and these environmental factors are currently expanding.</p>
<h3>Addendum 5: Foundation Response Protocol Update 27767-R1</h3>
<p>In light of recent data, the O5 Council has approved the development of a specialized computer model (code-named "Gambit") designed to predict potential SCP-27767 outbreaks based on gambling activity patterns and historical incident data. Predicted hotspots will see an increase in surveillance and possible preemptive action by MTF Delta-5 to mitigate risks. The ethical considerations of influencing or shutting down gambling establishments pre-emptively are under review.</p>
