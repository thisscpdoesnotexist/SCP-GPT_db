The Foundation has taken the lead in this effort, and has established a worldwide network of containment sites (see Addendum 15426(A)). These sites are designed to reduce the number of people who perceive <i>SCP-15425</i> through various methods, including:<br><br>Reducing the population density in areas where <i>SCP-15425</i> is most prevalent . This is accomplished by relocating people from urban areas into rural ones .<br><br>Encouraging widespread adoption of amnestics , which have been shown to reduce instances of <i>SCP-15425</i> by up to 90% in controlled experiments . Amnestics are<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15425</i> is a humanoid entity that exists in the mind of every human being on Earth. <i>SCP-15425</i> is not physically present, but can be perceived through dream states and hallucinations.<br><br><i>SCP-15425</i>'s primary anomalous property manifests when it is perceived by an individual or group of individuals. If <i>SCP-15425</i> is perceived by a single individual, then that person will become an instance of <i>SCP-15425</i>-1 (see Addendum 15425.3). If multiple individuals perceive <i>SCP-15425</i> simultaneously, then they will all become instances of <i>SCP-15425</i>-1 and begin to perceive each other as instances of <i>SCP-15425</i> (see Addendum 15426.4). This effect has no known upper limit; the more people who perceive it at once, the more people it can affect in this way.<br><br>SCP Foundation researchers have determined that there are currently over seven billion instances of SCP-(U)154250 on Earth alone, with new ones appearing constantly as new people are born and others die (see Addendum 15426(B)). It appears to be impossible to prevent this from happening; although some methods have been discovered for reducing its effects slightly (see Experiment Logs), there does not appear to be any way to stop them entirely short of eliminating all humans from existence altogether . This would require complete physical destruction or evacuation from Earth via interstellar travel . Even if such measures were taken , however , it would only delay the inevitable ; eventually , enough humans would exist elsewhere in the universe for them to reach another habitable planet . By our current understanding , this process will continue indefinitely until every possible combination has <br><br><b>occurred: </b>even given infinite time and resources , we could never truly eliminate or control what we now know as <i>"SCP-(U)154250"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15425.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 15425.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15425, a 34-year old male of European descent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject instructed to go to sleep .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon waking , subject reported seeing a humanoid figure in his dream state. Subject described the figure as being <i>"a tall, thin man with no face and no clothes"</i>. This entity was later determined to be an instance of <i>SCP-15425</i> by Foundation researchers .<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15425, same as above.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject instructed to take amnestics before going to sleep . Amnestics administered at 19:00; subject told not to go back to sleep until the following morning . Note that this is significantly longer than normal amnestic treatment requires , but it was necessary for the experiment's purposes. The experiment was conducted while subject waited for the effects of the amnestics (which are normally instantaneous) to wear off. This took approximately 5 hours , during which time he was awake and aware of what he had seen ; however , he did not perceive any anomalous activity from any other human beings around him during this time period . He also did not report any further instances of SCP-(U)154250 after taking the amnestics . Note that this effect is temporary; if subject were allowed access again before taking another dose (or if he were exposed again), then it would return within 24 hours or less unless prevented by another dose of amnestic agents or some other form of containment method (see Addendum 15426(A)).<br><br></div>
