The species appears to be sapient and capable of manipulating their environment in order to hide from human observers.<br><br>The exact number of <i>SCP-17061</i> instances is unknown, as they are able to blend into any environment without detection. However, it is speculated that there may be hundreds or even thousands of individual specimens spread across the world.<br><br><i>SCP-17061</i> instances appear to possess some form of telepathic communication network, allowing them to coordinate activities with each other over long distances and share information about potential threats or sources of food. They also possess advanced cognitive abilities, allowing them to understand complex concepts such as language and mathematics.<br><br>When threatened by humans or other perceived threats, <i>SCP-17061</i> will use its invisibility ability in order to avoid detection while attacking its target with physical force or psychokinetic energy blasts strong enough to cause serious injury or death if not blocked by protective measures such as armor plating or magical wards. <br><br>Due to their nature and capabilities, containment procedures for <i>SCP-17061</i> are extremely difficult and require constant vigilance on behalf of Foundation personnel stationed at the portal site in the ██████ forest where they originate from. Any sightings reported elsewhere should be investigated immediately for possible containment breaches<br><br><h3>Addendum 17061.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of <i>SCP-17061</i> instances attempted to breach containment by overwhelming the personnel stationed at the portal site. The attack was repelled with heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately prevented a major containment breach.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17061.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, an <i>SCP-17061</i> instance was captured and successfully contained. During the subsequent interview, it revealed that its species had been living in the pocket dimension for centuries and were only recently able to access our world through a portal created by unknown means. It also claimed that they had been observing humans for some time before making contact, but were afraid of being discovered due to their invisibility ability.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17061.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of <i>SCP-17061</i> instances was successfully lured into a containment chamber for further study. During the experiment, it was discovered that the species is capable of understanding and responding to human speech when spoken in an appropriate tone. The results of this experiment have been added to the description above.</div>
