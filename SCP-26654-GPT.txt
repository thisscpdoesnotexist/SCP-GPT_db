    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26654</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26654 refers to a group of five anomalous entities resembling the extinct ape species <em>Gigantopithecus blacki</em>, prominently featured in a music video produced by the fictional "Life Could Be A Dream" band. The video, titled "Harmony of Chaos," inexplicably appeared on various online platforms on [REDACTED]. Attempts to remove the video have proven futile, as it continually reuploads itself to various media outlets and even private devices.</p>
<p>These entities, designated SCP-26654-1 through -5, are capable of emerging from any screen displaying the video. Once materialized in the physical realm, SCP-26654 exhibits behavior that is both aggressive and unpredictable, often leading to extensive property damage, mass hysteria, and loss of life.</p>
<p>SCP-26654 displays several abnormal properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transitioning from digital to physical form, and vice versa, without apparent limitation.</li>
<li>Resistance to damage when in their physical form - conventional weaponry has proven largely ineffective.</li>
<li>The ability to manipulate electronic devices in their vicinity, causing malfunctions and sometimes permanent damage.</li>
<li>A disrupting influence on human neural activity, inducing nightmares, insomnia, and in severe cases, permanent psychological trauma.</li>
</ol>
<p>Researchers hypothesize that SCP-26654's repeated phrase "Life could be a dream" in the video might hold a form of cognitohazardous or memetic influence, but this has yet to be fully understood.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to SCP-26654's erratic behavior and its ability to manifest anywhere the "Harmony of Chaos" music video is played, containment must focus on minimizing exposure and rapid response intervention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Webcrawler AI, designated Sigma-26654, is to monitor the internet continuously and suppress the online presence of the "Harmony of Chaos" music video.</li>
<li>Embedded Foundation agents within internet service providers, social media companies, and government communication regulatory bodies are to assist in the containment by rerouting or deleting content related to SCP-26654.</li>
<li>Mobile Task Forces (MTFs) equipped with specialized electromagnetic frequency (EMF) disruptors are to be on standby to engage SCP-26654 manifestations.</li>
<li>Civilians exposed to SCP-26654 are to be administered Class-A amnestics.</li>
<li>Research into finding a permanent containment or neutralization solution is ongoing.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Addendum 1:</h3>
<p><strong>Interview Log 26654-A</strong></p>
<p>Interviewee: Dr. Isaac Yalom<br />
Interviewer: Dr. Yuna Oshiro<br />
Date: [REDACTED]<br />
Location: Secure Interrogation Room, Site-19</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oshiro:</strong> Good morning, Dr. Yalom. How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yalom:</strong> Exhausted. I spent all night running analyses on the last manifestation...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oshiro:</strong> Speaking of which, let's talk about your experience with SCP-26654's projection from yesterday. Can you walk me through what happened?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Yalom details the events leading up to the manifestation, citing an accidental playback of the "Harmony of Chaos" video on a research terminal. He describes the sudden appearance and aggressive behavior of SCP-26654-3.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oshiro:</strong> And how did you finally manage to repel it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yalom:</strong> By accident, really. One of the junior researchers had used an experimental EMF pulse device on a separate project. I remembered it from a staff meeting and—I don't know—I just grabbed it and switched it on. SCP-26654-3 started glitching, like a corrupted video file, and then it just... folded back into the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Oshiro:</strong> Interesting. This will definitely inform our approach to containment. Your quick thinking may have saved lives, Dr. Yalom.</p>

<h3>Addendum 2:</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment Log 26654-B</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26654-E1: Neutralizing cognitohazard effects</strong><br />
Date: [REDACTED]<br />
Subject: D-8432<br />
Procedure: D-8432 was exposed to a 10-second clip of the "Harmony of Chaos" video under controlled conditions.<br />
Results: Subject experienced immediate disorientation, followed by intense migraines. No long-term neutralization of SCP-26654's cognitohazardous effects achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26654-E2: Containment via sound frequency manipulation</strong><br />
Date: [REDACTED]<br />
Subject: Audio equipment with a range of frequency outputs<br />
Procedure: Several frequencies were broadcasted to determine if they affected SCP-26654's ability to materialize.<br />
Results: Frequencies below 20 Hz and above 20 kHz seemed to delay manifestation but not prevent it.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26654-E3: Engagement with EMF disruptors</strong><br />
Date: [REDACTED]<br />
Subject: SCP-26654-4<br />
Procedure: MTF Unit Delta-5 ("Frontline Havoc") engaged SCP-26654-4 with EMF disruptors upon manifestation.<br />
Results: SCP-26654-4 was repelled into its digital form within 3 minutes. No casualties. EMF disruptors proved to be a viable containment tool.</p>
