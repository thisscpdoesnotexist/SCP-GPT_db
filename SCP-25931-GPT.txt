    <h1>SCP-25931</h1>
<h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-25931</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25931 refers to a highly secretive and influential organization, composed entirely of individuals colloquially known as "femboys," who reportedly possess extraordinary influence over global political and economic systems. While the term "femboy" is commonly used in popular culture to describe a specific gender expression that is typically male but adopts clothing and behaviors typically associated with females, SCP-25931's members are believed to embody this identity while also exhibiting anomalous traits.</p>
<p>The order is said to be operating since at least the 17th century, with its influence expanding significantly with the advent of modern communications and financial systems. Members of SCP-25931 are difficult to identify due to their ability to seamlessly integrate into various levels of government and corporate structures, leveraging their positions to guide policy decisions without revealing their connections to one another.</p>
<p>The anomalous effects reportedly wielded by SCP-25931 members include advanced mind control, reality-warping, and possibly a form of precognition that allows them to anticipate and neutralize potential threats to their order. Efforts to infiltrate or expose the organization have historically met with failure, often followed by the rapid and unexplained downfall of the involved agents or institutions.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to SCP-25931's extensive influence and anomalous capabilities, direct containment is currently deemed unfeasible. Foundation efforts are focused on the constant surveillance of suspected members and the deterrence of their impact on global events. Agents embedded within various government and financial entities are directed to track policy changes and financial flows that may indicate SCP-25931 activity.</p>
<p>A disinformation campaign, codenamed Operation Counter-Weave, has been authorized. Its primary goal is to sow doubts regarding the existence and credibility of an order of this nature, thus making it harder for SCP-25931 to operate openly or recruit potential new members.</p>
<p>Additional directives include the development of psychic dampening technology and counter-anomalous methods in the event of an encounter with a confirmed member. Any Foundation personnel who are suspected to have come into contact with SCP-25931 are to undergo immediate amnestic treatment and intensive psychological evaluation.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1:</h3>
<p>SCP-25931 was first brought to the Foundation's attention by documents recovered from a defunct occult group known as the "Hermetic Circle of the Red Scepter." These documents contained detailed accounts of SCP-25931's operations and implicated several historical figures as possible members.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2:</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment Log 25931-Alpha</strong></p>
<p><em>Experiment #1:</em>
Objective: To determine the extent of SCP-25931's influence over a minor political election.
Procedure: Foundation agents attempted to sway the results of a local election in [REDACTED].
Result: Despite significant effort and resources, the preferred candidate was defeated, and multiple agents reported memory loss and disorientation after the event.</p>
<p><em>Experiment #2:</em>
Objective: To intercept a communication between suspected members of SCP-25931.
Procedure: Cybersecurity teams deployed advanced signal interception tools during a scheduled meeting of government officials.
Result: All equipment malfunctioned simultaneously, and the data collected was corrupted. Agents on-site experienced severe headaches and visual disturbances.</p>
<p>Further experiments are pending review and approval from O5 Command.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 25931-Delta</strong></p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Dr. [REDACTED]</p>
<p><em>Interviewed:</em> D-59321 (a Foundation informant claiming previous association with SCP-25931)</p>
<p><strong><Begin Log></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Please state your knowledge of SCP-25931 for the record.</p>
<p><strong>D-59321:</strong> They're real. They control things... more than anyone knows. I've seen it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Can you provide specific instances of SCP-25931's influence?</p>
<p><strong>D-59321:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. [REDACTED]:</strong> That's quite a claim. How do they exercise this influence?</p>
<p><strong>D-59321:</strong> Through subtle suggestions, manipulation of desires, and leveraging secrets. They can make you do things... without you ever realizing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. [REDACTED]:</strong> And how does their anomalous nature come into play?</p>
<p><strong>D-59321:</strong> It's all connected... Look, they're always watching. They're probably listening right now. You can't stop them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong><End Log></strong></p>
<p>Following the interview, D-59321 was found to have suffered extreme mental degradation and expired shortly thereafter. Autopsy results were inconclusive, and the cause of the rapid decline in mental health remains unidentified. Any further interviews with individuals claiming knowledge of SCP-25931 have been suspended indefinitely.</p></div>
