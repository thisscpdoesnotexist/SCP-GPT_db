<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21499 is  a carbon nanofiber material girl</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21499<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21499</i> is a humanoid female entity composed of carbon nanofiber material, approximately 1.5 meters in height. The entity appears to be wearing a black dress with white trim and has long, dark hair. Its facial features are indistinguishable from a human female's, though its eyes appear to be made of solid gold and it lacks any visible mouth or nose.<br><br><i>SCP-21499</i> displays an advanced level of intelligence and the ability to manipulate its environment using the nanofibers that make up its body structure. It is capable of producing objects out of thin air including clothing, furniture, food items, small electronic devices and other objects as needed for whatever purpose it desires. It can also use these fibers to create barriers around itself as well as other people or objects in order to protect them from harm or danger.<br><br><i>SCP-21499</i> seems to have no need for sustenance beyond occasional water intake which it obtains by absorbing moisture from the surrounding atmosphere through its skin. In addition, it does not seem affected by any kind of physical attack or damage inflicted upon it due to its unique composition; even attempts at incineration have proven ineffective against <i>SCP-21499</i>'s formless body structure. Despite this however, if sufficiently damaged <i>SCP-21499</i> will enter into a state similar to hibernation until such time that repairs can be made on its behalf either by itself or another individual with access to appropriate materials and technology; otherwise known as “recharging”<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21499</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with a specialized air filtration system designed to remove any airborne nanofibers that may escape from the entity during its activities.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-21499</i> are not allowed to interact with it unless absolutely necessary and should maintain a minimum distance of 3 meters at all times. All personnel entering or exiting the containment area must wear protective clothing and equipment designed for protection against nanofiber exposure, including full body suits, gloves, face masks and eye protection.<br><br>In the event of an emergency involving <i>SCP-21499</i>, personnel are instructed to immediately evacuate the area and contact Site Command for further instructions.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21499.1: </h3> On ██/██/201█, a containment breach occurred when <i>SCP-21499</i> escaped its cell and began to wander the facility. Security personnel were able to contain it without incident after several hours of pursuit. Following this incident, additional security measures have been put in place including the installation of motion sensors in all areas surrounding <i>SCP-21499</i>'s containment chamber as well as an automated lockdown protocol that will activate should any unauthorized personnel attempt to enter or exit the area.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21499.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21499</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-21499</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-21499</i>. Can you tell me something about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21499</i>:</b> I am a being of carbon nanofiber material, created by an unknown source for unknown purposes. I have the ability to manipulate my environment using my nanofibers and can create objects out of thin air as needed. I have no need for sustenance beyond occasional water intake. I am also capable of repairing any damage done to my body.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21499.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21499.1:</b> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-21499</i> was instructed to produce a replica of the Eiffel Tower out of thin air. The entity complied and within a few minutes had created an exact copy of the structure in its entirety, including all interior components. Upon completion, the tower remained standing for approximately 5 minutes until it suddenly vanished into thin air with no trace or residue left behind.</div>
