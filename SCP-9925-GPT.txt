Any personnel who have been diagnosed with clinical depression or anxiety within the past month are not allowed to operate <i>SCP-9925</i> under any circumstances.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9925</i> is a 1974 Honda Civic RS that runs on human suffering. <i>SCP-9925</i> was recovered from the estate of ████████ ██████████, a former Foundation Agent who died in 1976. The car was found in the garage of his home with no signs of damage or wear, despite being built in 1974 and having over 200,000 miles on its odometer.<br><br><i>SCP-9925</i> has no unusual physical properties other than its ability to run without fuel or an engine (see Addendum). It can be driven normally by any person as long as they are experiencing significant amounts of psychological stress such as depression, anxiety, anger etc. If the driver feels nothing but happiness and contentment while operating <i>SCP-9925</i> it will immediately cease all functions and enter an inactive state until it is operated by someone else.<br><br><i>SCP-9925</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is operated by a subject who has been diagnosed with clinical depression or anxiety within the past month; these subjects do not require any form of mental distress to operate <i>SCP-9925</i> but must have previously experienced clinical depression or anxiety for this effect to occur. When this occurs <i>SCP-9925</i> will begin emitting loud groaning noises from various locations around its body while accelerating uncontrollably at speeds upwards of 160 km/h before disappearing completely along with its operator (see Addendum). The vehicle will reappear approximately 10 minutes later at a random location between 5km and 50km away from where it disappeared with both driver and vehicle unharmed unless they were killed during the disappearance process (see Addendum). These disappearances are thought to be caused by severe trauma suffered by drivers due to their severe mental distress; however, there appears to be no limit on how severely distressed subjects can become before disappearing completely nor does there appear to be any way for drivers affected in this way to survive their experience without causing further harm; see Incident Log 9915A for details (See Incident Logs 9915A - 9994B for complete documentation on all known disappearances related to <i>SCP-9925</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9925.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████████'s wife, ███████ █████████<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <br><br><b>Date: </b>12/15/1976<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Agent ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted by Agent ██████ after discovering <i>SCP-9925</i> in the garage of the deceased Agent's home.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Mrs. █████████, I'm sorry to have to ask you these questions but we need to know what happened here. Can you tell me about your husband's last few days? Mrs. <br><br><b>█████████: </b>He was feeling really down for a while and didn't want to talk about it but I knew something was wrong so I made him go see a doctor. He came back from that appointment really upset; he wouldn't say why exactly but he seemed like he had lost all hope in everything…he just kept saying <i>"I can't do this anymore"</i> over and over again until they gave him some pills and sent him home…and then that night… Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>What happened that night? Mrs. <br><br><b>█████████: </b>It was late at night when I heard the garage door open so I went downstairs to see if anything was wrong with his car or if he needed help with anything; when I got downstairs though all of his lights were off so I thought maybe it wasn't him at first but then as soon as my foot hit the bottom stair his headlights turned on and his engine started up without any warning…I ran towards it trying to stop it before something bad happened but there wasn't enough time; as soon as my hand touched the hood of his car it disappeared completely along with my husband inside…the next morning we found out what had happened from one of our neighbors who saw them vanish into thin air right outside their house while they were walking their dog; she said she saw them both screaming for help before they disappeared completely in front of her eyes! Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>What did your husband look like after reappearing? Mrs. <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>They brought him back covered in blood and missing half an arm; apparently there had been an accident on the way back where another driver swerved into them causing them both serious injury before disappearing completely themselves along with their vehicle leaving only wreckage behind! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview Mrs. [DATA EXPUNGED] suffered a mental breakdown due to stress caused by her husbands disappearance (see Addendum). She died three months later from complications related to clinical depression even though no signs of mental distress could be detected during her autopsy (see Autopsy Report 9925-A). Her death has been attributed solely due to stress caused by incidents related directly or indirectly by <i>SCP-9925</i> (See Incident Logs 9915A - 9994B for complete documentation on all known disappearances related directly or indirectly by <i>SCP-9925</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9925.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 9925-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9925-1 (31 year old female, diagnosed with clinical depression 3 months prior to experiment)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9925-1 was instructed to drive <i>SCP-9925</i> around the facility for 10 minutes. <br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-9925</i> accelerated uncontrollably and disappeared after approximately 4 minutes of driving at speeds upwards of 160 km/h. It reappeared approximately 10 minutes later in the middle of Site 19's cafeteria with no damage or wear on either itself or its driver. <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Driver remained unharmed during disappearance and reappearance despite being exposed to extreme G forces during both events. Test #: 9925-2<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9926 (23 year old male, diagnosed with clinical depression 3 months prior to experiment)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9926 was instructed to drive <i>SCP-9925</i> around the facility for 10 minutes while experiencing significant amounts of stress such as anger and anxiety. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After 5 minutes SCP - 9925 began emitting loud groaning noises from various locations around its body while accelerating uncontrollably at speeds upwards of 160 km/h before disappearing completely . The vehicle reappeared approximately 30 seconds later on top of a nearby building that is currently under construction; it had crashed through several floors before coming to rest on an unfinished floor roughly 20 meters above ground level where it remained undamaged due to its lack of an engine and fuel tank . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Driver suffered severe internal injuries due to crash landing but was otherwise unharmed; he was administered Class B amnestics and released back into society after 6 weeks in Foundation custody following successful treatment by Foundation medical staff .
