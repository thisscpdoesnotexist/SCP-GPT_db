<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17285 is  A piece of chocolate beggin to be eaten, but nobody wants it</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17285<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17285</i> is a piece of chocolate in the shape of a human hand. It appears to be made from high quality cocoa, but has no identifiable brand or logo.<br><br>When consumed by an individual, <i>SCP-17285</i> will cause them to experience intense cravings for more and begin to compulsively eat any other chocolate within reach. These cravings are not limited to just chocolate, as individuals affected by <i>SCP-17285</i> have been known to consume other sweets and desserts with equal enthusiasm.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17285</i> can only be reversed if the individual consumes a large amount of water or some form of sugar substitute (not including artificial sweeteners). If this is done before the individual has consumed too much food, they will recover without any lasting effects. However, if they have already eaten too much then they may suffer from digestive issues such as indigestion or nausea for several hours afterwards.<br><br>In addition, it should be noted that consuming <i>SCP-17285</i> does not appear to provide any nutritional value whatsoever; all calories ingested via this method are simply burned off shortly afterwards with no benefit gained whatsoever.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17285</i> is to be stored in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17285</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any individuals affected by <i>SCP-17285</i> are to be monitored closely and provided with medical attention if necessary. In addition, any chocolate or other sweets that have been consumed by an individual affected by <i>SCP-17285</i> should be disposed of immediately, as they may contain trace amounts of the anomalous properties present in <i>SCP-17285</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17285.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a sample of <i>SCP-17285</i> was found in the possession of an individual who had been arrested for shoplifting. The individual claimed that they had found the item <i>"in a dumpster"</i> and were unaware of its anomalous properties. They have since been administered Class A amnestics and released without further incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17285.2: </h3> Interview with D-17285<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-17285<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> D-17285 was a volunteer who had been given <i>SCP-17285</i> for testing purposes.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> So, how did you find the experience of consuming <i>SCP-17285</i>?<br><b><br>D-17285:</b> It was… strange. I don't know how to describe it, really. It felt like I couldn't get enough of it, like my body wanted more and more and wouldn't stop until I had eaten everything in sight. It was almost like an addiction or something.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Interesting. And did you experience any other effects?<br><b><br>D-17285:</b> Yeah, I felt kind of sick afterwards, like I had eaten too much or something. It was really weird.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> I see. Thank you for your cooperation, D-17285. That will be all for now.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> D-17285 was administered a Class-B amnestic and released from containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17285.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 17285-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-1928, a male human.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was given one piece of <i>SCP-17285</i> and instructed to consume it.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Within minutes of consuming the chocolate, D-1928 began to experience intense cravings for more. He proceeded to search the room for any other sweets or desserts before eventually being restrained by personnel due to his increasingly erratic behavior. After roughly thirty minutes, he had consumed all available snacks in the room and was provided with a large glass of water which successfully reversed the effects of <i>SCP-17285</i> and allowed him to regain control over himself.</div>
