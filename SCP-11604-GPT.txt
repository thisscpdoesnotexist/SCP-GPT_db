Testing with the object is currently prohibited, due to the risk of accidental exposure of non-Foundation personnel .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11604</i> is a wooden ocarina of unknown origin, measuring approximately 12.5cm in length and 7.3cm in width. It has been painted with black lacquer and decorated with gold leaf, and is considered to be of high quality.<br><br><i>SCP-11604</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is played by an individual capable of producing a pitch at least one octave lower than the lowest note on the instrument (hereafter referred to as <i>SCP-11604</i>-1). When this occurs, all matter within a radius of 15m surrounding <i>SCP-11604</i> will begin to rapidly dematerialise . The rate at which this occurs increases proportionally to the volume produced by <i>SCP-11604</i>-1; furthermore, any matter that would have been displaced by this process will instead be transported into an alternate dimension (hereafter referred to as Dimension 1) . This process will continue until either <i>SCP-11604</i> stops being played or all matter within range has been transported into Dimension 1; however, if the latter event occurs before <i>SCP-11604</i> stops playing then all displaced material will immediately return from Dimension 1 and resume its place prior to dematerialisation occurring .<br><br>The sound produced by <i>SCP-11604</i> can also affect nonliving material; specifically, any objects that are struck while being affected by such sounds will become intangible for approximately 10 seconds after contact with said object ceases . This effect can only occur once per object per instance of exposure , regardless of whether or not said object was completely removed from our universe during its time as an intangible entity . The effects caused by playing SCP - 11 604 are cumulative ; for example , if two separate instances were played simultaneously then all affected objects would become intangible after 20 seconds , rather than 10 . Additionally , it should be noted that no form of shielding appears able to prevent these effects from occurring ; however , they do appear capable of preventing them from extending beyond their normal range ( i.e., anything protected behind walls or other solid barriers remains intact )<br><br><h3>Addendum 11604.1 : </h3><br><br>The following is a transcript of an interview conducted with the musician who discovered <i>SCP-11604</i>, shortly after its initial containment.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Joshua █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted approximately one month after the discovery of <i>SCP-11604</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, Mr. █████, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your discovery of <i>SCP-11604</i> . Joshua <br><br><b>█████: </b>Sure thing . <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>First off , can you tell me how you came across the object ? Joshua <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well , I was just doing some woodwork in my shed and found it lying on my workbench . It looked pretty old so I decided to clean it up and keep it as a memento or something . <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>And did anything unusual happen when you first played it ? Joshua <br><br><b>█████: </b>No , not at first . It sounded normal enough ; then again , I'm not really that good at playing music anyway so… ( At this point in time, Mr.████ appears to become uncomfortable ) …I don't know why but whenever I played it for more than a couple minutes something would start to feel wrong ; like there was someone watching me or something… ( Mr K████ pauses here for several seconds) …Then one night while I was playing this thing just sorta went nuts and started making these weird noises ! That's when everything started dematerialising around me ! After that things got pretty crazy; there were all these weird creatures appearing out of nowhere and attacking me!
