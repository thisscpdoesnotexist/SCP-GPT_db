The object's abilities were discovered when Agent ███████ accidentally came into contact with it and claimed to hear voices inside his head.<br><br><i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> has the ablility to predict what will happen in the future, however it can only do this if an individual comes into contact with it and then has a dream that correlates to its prediction within 24 hours of coming into contact with <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>. It also seems that SCP 9013 is able to predict events up to 2 years from now as well as events occuring before SCP 9013 was recovered by foundation personnel. However this information does not come from dreams but rather thoughts or visions experienced by those who have touched SCP 9014. No one other than those who have had direct physical contact with 9014 have been able to sense these visions so there is no way at present time for us know exactly what they are predicting, nor do we know how much knowledge regarding the future they possess other than that which pertains directly or indirectly (via third parties)to themselves or their subjects of study directly or indirectly (via third parties) related through themselfs' actions/knowledge/etc…<br><br>Upon coming into physical conact with an individual,the subject will experience a dream about an event predicted by 9014 within 24 hours after touching the object . The event experienced may be about either themselves or another person directly involved in their life(family etc.)<br> For example: Agent J███ snuck past security and touched SCp -90130 right after classing D class personal attending his lecture on shackle safety . He then went home slept for 6 hours woke up had dinner read some books ate lunch went back out for his afternoon class spent 10 min talking about electric shock hazards (he said he forgot something but he didn't say what)then slept again for 6 hours woke up got ready for work got off work walked home had dinner watched tv played video games sexed wife went back out worked called my parents went home watched tv slept saw my grandma she died then I dreamed I was her at her funeral (This happened because I knew she would die soon because my parents told me 2 weeks before hand).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> was discovered in the attic of a house in ██████, Virginia. The owner of the house had died and his family was moving out. When they found that there had been a banana growing up there for years, they contacted the police and SCP foundation.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9013.1 :</h3> Interview with Agent ███████<br><br><br>Interviewed: Agent ███████<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. Z█████<br><br><Begin Log><br><br>Dr. Z█████: Good morning, Agent ███████.
