If any object goes into the cell of <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>, it will register that object on its skin and then predict what will happen to that object. If an object goes into the cell but does not get registered, <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> becomes very angry and starts destroying everything in sight.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> is a banana that has been cut open. <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> will predict the future of any object or person that it sees. It was found by █████ High School in ████, IL. The school was destroyed and all students were killed by <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> was found in ████, IL. A student had reported to his parents that he had seen a banana predict the future repeatedly. The family did not believe him and reported it to the police. When the police arrived, they sent in investigators to investigate if there was some sort of gas that had made all of them hallucinate. The investigator walked towards <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> and when he got right next to it, <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> said <i>"<br>You will die in 6 days at 6:06 PM."</i> The investigator started freaking out and ran for his life but tripped on something and broke his neck on the way down. All other investigators were killed by <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> except for one who left quickly before any harm came upon him.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9013.1 :</h3> Interview<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i><br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. ██████<br><br><br>Foreword: The interview was done for understanding of how <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> works and to see if we could get it to become less aggressive. <Begin Log> Dr. ██████: Hello SCP….. 9013, can you hear me?<br><br><i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>: Yes I can hear you loud and clear! Dr. ██████: Good to know that I'm not going crazy! So, what's your name?<br><br><i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> *Looks at the ceiling* It says my name is Banana…but I can't really remember a time when someone called me that..or anything else for that matter… Dr. ██████ : Right…If you don't mind me asking, why do you kill things when they come in your cell?<br><br><i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> *Sighs* Well, when I first came here, people would come in my cell and try to cut off parts of me or dissect me! Now whenever anyone goes into my cell I just attack them so nothing bad will happen again.<br><br>Dr. ██████ : Interesting….So what do you predict about this banana right here? *Holds up a banana* What happens if someone touches this one? Will it die in 6 days at 6 o'clock PM too?! <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> -<br> GPT : Mmmhhmmm! That's exactly what will happen if someone touches it!! How did you know?! That's impossible!! Unless…unless it already happened?? Or will happen?? Oh no nooooooo!!! *Screaming ensues for the next 3 minutes before the guards sedate him* <End Log><br> Closing Statement : It seems as though SCP - 9011 has an alternate personality running through its subconscious mind , which is able to predict some things but not everything . This might be due to incomplete information about its origin . Further evaluation required .<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9013.2 :</h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment 9013-1: Testing if <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> can predict anything other than death.<br><br><br>Subjects : D-11424, D-11425, D-11429, and 3 guards.<br><br><br>Procedure : The test subjects are to walk into <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>'s cell and interact with it. The guards are there to ensure that nothing goes wrong .<br><br><br>Results : 2 of the 4 test subjects were killed by SCP - 9013 . 1 escaped but was terminated by the guards after being found hiding near the containment cell of SCP - 9011 . 1 was left unharmed , but due to nervousness could not be interviewed thoroughly before being sedated because of distressed breathing . It is currently unknown how he was able to survive without injuries , as he has not yet been reinterviewed in order for us to know what happened in his head when he entered the cell of SCP - 9011 . It is also unknown whether or not this reaction will occur again in future tests , so further testing with D - 11424 has been postponed until we can learn more about his reaction with further experimentation . See addendum for Experiment log #9014 and addendum #9014a for more information on why this reaction occured in previous tests with subject D 11424 and future possibilities concerning repeat performances of this reaction from other test subjects who have had similar reactions during testing involving interaction with SCP -<br> 9011.
