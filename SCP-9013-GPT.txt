The content of the box changes depending on the time of the day .<br><i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> was recovered in ███████ , Ohio, after multiple reports of missing shoes were reported to local law enforcement. After an investigation, <i>SCP-9013</i> was found in a field near where reports indicated it would be. The contents of the box at this time were three pairs of shoes and a note written on paper with <i>"Plans for world domination"</i> handwritten on it. A man claiming to be responsible for these actions has been arrested and has confessed to his involvement; see addendum 9013 -1 for more information .<br><b><br><h3>Recovery:</h3></b> <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> was recovered in ███████, Ohio after multiple reports of missing shoes were reported to local law enforcement.

Why haven't you taken care of them? Are you stupid? I told you I would need them soon, but you must have forgotten about that too! You are useless! Get out here now before I throw you out!<br><h3>Addendum 9013.1 :</h3></b> Interview with the man who was arrested for his involvement in <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i>.<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> The man arrested for his involvement in <i>SCP-9013</i> - GPT<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr . ████████████<br><Begin Log><br>Dr . ████████████<b><br> :</b> Hello. Could you please tell me why you put together a plan to take over the world? Any reason at all will do, so don't bother lying about it. We already know what happened anyway. Your reason doesn't matter anymore, so just give us something to pass the time with.<br><b><br>The man :</b> I'll tell you why I did it! It's because those shoes are some of my favorites! They're comfortable as hell and make my feet feel great after a long day of walking around on them! But they're very expensive and some people can't afford to buy them, that's why I had to come up with a plan like this one! You see, by taking over the world, I would be able to get as many pairs as I want without having anyone stop me from getting more pairs! And then everyone could have these shoes and we'd all be happy because we could have these shoes no matter if we were rich or poor or anything else! That is why I made those plans for world domination; so that everyone could have their own pair of Nike brand sneakers if they wanted them without having any kind of problem whatsoever! <End Log><b><br> Closing Statement:</b> After this interview was finished, Dr . ████████████ proceeded into a rant about how he hates Nike brand sneakers due to their horrible design and how uncomfortable they are compared to other shoe brands such as Reebok , New Balance , Converse , Adidas , Vans , etc.<br><h3>Addendum 9013.2 :</h3></b> After testing was approved by a level 4 researcher,<b><br> the following information about the box and its contents was found out:</b><br>The weight of <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> is five kilograms. No matter what is inside of it , it will always weigh five kilograms . The dimensions of <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> are two hundred and twenty centimeters long, one hundred and thirty centimeters wide, and fifty centimeters tall. Due to this fact , no matter what is inside of <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> , It will always have these dimensions . Every time an object enters or leaves from <i>SCP-9013</i> - GPT, a flash of light will emit from the shoebox. This flash can reach up to three meters away from SCP - 901 3 - GPT every time something enters or leaves it . It has been proven that this flash can affect humans as well if they are looking at the box during this event. When any object enters or leaves from 901 3 - GPT, a human hand reaches into/out of it as if searching for something on the ground until all objects that entered/left have been removed/replaced within nine seconds after entering/leaving . This hand is attached to an arm which has been identified as belonging to Dr . ██████ (see addendum 033 ) but does not belong to him anymore due to his death in 19██ (see incident 033 ) If there are no objects within 9013 – GPT when testing begins</div>
