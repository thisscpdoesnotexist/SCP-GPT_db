No personnel are permitted to enter <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> except for testing purposes.<br><b><br><h3>Description:</h3></b> <i><i>SCP-9013</i>-GPT</i> is a Voskhod-3KV spacecraft reentry module. <i>SCP-9013</i> was recovered in 1973 from the █████████ Cosmodrome after reports of a landing by multiple witnesses. The module bears heavy exterior damage, with several components being completely destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and several torn open on the inside. The viewports have been welded shut on the outside by an unidentified agent, and a slimy substance covers all viewports on the inside.<br><i>SCP-9013</i>'s interio<b><br>r consists of two compartments:</b> a control compartment in which its pilot sits, and a smaller compartment in which passengers sit during launch/reentry procedures. <i>SCP-9013</i> is powered by four ████████ D17 engines located outside the main hull. These engines are fed propellant from [REDACTED]. [SEE ADDENDUM 9014a]<br>[DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. This resulted in <i>SCP-</i>[REDACTED]-BPT landing safely back at Site-[REDACTED]. This is believed to be due to faulty wiring within said engine's control circuit boards; these boards were replaced with newer models following testing on 09/12/████ (See Addendum 9014b). It should be noted that engine 3 suffered severe damage during this test and will require significant repair before it can be used again; this represents 34% of all accessible working D17s still remaining for use with Voskhod spacecrafts currently available for use at Site-[REDACTED], meaning that no more tests involving <i>SCP-</i>(D17)-BPT may take place until such repairs have been completed (see Addendum 9014c).<br><b><br><h3>Recovery:</h3></b> <i>SCP-9013</i> was recovered from the █████████ Cosmodrome in 1973 after reports of a landing by multiple witnesses. A recovery team was dispatched to the Cosmodrome, and <i>SCP-9013</i> was found inside an abandoned hangar at the site.<br><h3>Addendum 9013.1 </h3></b> Testing Logs<br>+ ACCESS TESTING LOGS - A<b><br>CCESS TESTING LOGS Test Number:</b> 9013/09/<b><br>12 Test Subject:</b> D-901431, a 48 year old Caucasian male. Subject was equipped with a 2-way radio to communicate with the testing team, and was informed of the nature of <i>SCP-9013</i>'s anomalous properties.<b><br> Procedure:</b> D-901431 was instructed to enter <i>SCP-9013</i> via its main hatch; once inside, he would begin controlled reentry procedures (flight profile CCCP 903a). Tests were conducted at Site-[REDACTED].<b><br> Results:</b> Upon entering via the main hatch, subject reported seeing <i>"the most magnificent view I've ever seen"</i> before describing an intense blinding light; after this had subsided he saw no abnormal activity. Upon deceleration phase (see Test Summary for details), subject experienced intense G forces which caused him to black out temporarily; when he regained consciousness he found himself in his seat with no abnormal visual or auditory sensations noted. After recovery by MTF Beta 4 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>), subject reported that his experience inside <i>SCP-9013</i> was <i>"pretty cool"</i>.<b><br> Additional Notes:</b> The sensation created by reentry phase is similar to that experienced on Earth during atmospheric entry of manned spacecraft. It is currently not known whether or not any other sensations are created during this stage of flight as MTF Beta 4 has yet to report back about any changes in behavior exhibited by personnel upon returning from space missions.<br>+ ACCESS ADDENDUM 9014a - ACCESS<b><br> ADDENDUM 9014a Addendum 9014a:</b> Attached herewith is a printout from Site-[REDACTED]'s ████████ database displaying test logs for Voskhod engines 3 through 10 following Incident [DATA EXPUNGED]. Incident occurred on 09/11/████ at 0900 hours UTC while testing engine 3 using <i>SCP-</i>(D17)-BPT as its fuel source following repairs made after Incident [DATA EXPUNGED]. See 'Addendum #2' below for further information concerning said incident and how it relates to current containment procedures for <i>SCP-</i>(D17)-BPT.. Addendum #<b><br>1 :</b> On 08/10/████ at 0500 hours UTC, routine testing began using engine 10 as its power source regarding control circuits within all engines used within Voskhod spacecrafts capable of being launched from Site-[REDACTED] following upgrades made over past year due to increasing demand placed on available machinery equipment and housing facilities being used at site location by Foundation personnel conducting research into field expedient methods involving launching spacecraft into orbit as well as potential uses for captured hostile extraterrestrial craft acquired either under special conditions or via raid style extractions exhibiting violent tendencies towards humans attempting contact without prior knowledge supplied beforehand concerning current containment protocols issued from O5 command staff detailing proper protocol in regards removing said craft and placing them into secure storage locations away from civilian populations (See Document RIDEOUT Protocol 471).<br><h3>Addendum 9013.2 </h3> Incident Log:</b><br>+ ACCESS ADDENDUM 9014b - ACCESS ADDENDUM 9014b Addendum #<b><br>2:</b> On 09/11/████ at 0900 hours UTC, <i>SCP-9013</i> was used as its own fuel source to power the engine now designated as <i>SCP-</i>(D17)-BPT. Procedures were identical to those used during previous test logs involving D17 engines 3 through 10 (see Addendum 9014a). Due to abnormal behavior exhibited by engine 3, it was decided that all control circuits would be run on the newly installed replacement circuit board; given that this was a new experimental design given approval for use by O5 command staff and researchers involved in field expedient methods concerning manned space travel and hostile extraterrestrial craft acquisition (See Document RIDEOUT Protocol 471), it is believed that the anomalous behavior exhibited by engine 3 during previous test logs represents a manufacturing defect within said control circuit boards rather than any inherent flaw within design.<b><br> Results:</b> Upon ignition of <i>SCP-</i>(D17)-BPT, <i>SCP-9013</i> instantly accelerated out of control and began accelerating towards Site-[REDACTED] at an estimated rate of Mach 20.</div>
