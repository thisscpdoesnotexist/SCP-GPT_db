These natives were all administered Class A amnestics, and the island was quarantined.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> was recovered from a cave on the ███ Island in 19██. It was discovered by one of the natives, who had been instructed to search for a bird that would bring him good luck.<br><br>The native returned with <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> and placed it upon an altar in his home, where he began to pray to it daily. After several weeks of doing this, the native noticed that foodstuffs he left outside his house seemed to disappear overnight. He attributed this at first to local wildlife, but when these phenomena continued over several days he concluded that <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> must be responsible and so began worshipping it more fervently than ever before.<br><br><i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>'s effects were eventually noticed by Foundation operatives embedded in the ████ government (which had recently annexed the island), and an investigation was launched shortly thereafter which led to its acquisition along with other anomalous objects currently contained at Site 84 (including <i>SCP--GPT</i>████)<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9013.1 :</h3> Interview <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>:<br><br>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ ███, an anthropologist attached to the Foundation, with a member of the ████ tribe who had discovered <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> and originally taken it home (who has since been given the pseudonym <i>"Sylvain"</i>).<br><br><br>Interviewed: Sylvain Interviewer: Dr. ██████ ███<br> Foreword: The following interview was conducted in French; all translations were provided by Dr. ██████ and checked for accuracy beforehand. <Begin Log> Dr. ██████: Good afternoon Sylvain, thank you for agreeing to this interview with me today! I would like to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i> if that's alright?<br> Sylvain: You are welcome doctor! I am happy yo talk about our little bird friend! This is what he brought us luck after all! It is thanks to him that we came together as a tribe once more! He gave us hope when there was none left… I do not know how he does it but it is lovely… Dr. ██████: Yes well let's begin shall we? Do you mind telling me how long ago your people began worshipping <i>SCP-9013-GPT</i>?<br> Sylvain: Oh yes of course doctor, let me think… This must have started two seasons ago now I think… Yes two seasons ago exactly when my father went missing while hunting in the jungle… He never came back so my mother told me to look for him because she thought maybe he had encountered something bad out there... <Sylvain pauses briefly> But then one day I found something even better than my father sitting outside our hut instead!! Something that looked just like his skeleton but much smaller.. And then one day after praying before it - suddenly food began appearing outside our house overnight!!<br> Back then we were hungry all the time because it had been so long since anyone here ate properly but suddenly food began appearing every morning where previously there had never been nothing nothing at all... The other villagers thought maybe this bird really could be magical... And so they asked me if they could come visit our hut too and pray along side us.. That is why now everyone prays before this bird together :3 We are one big family again thanks to 9013 ! Thank YOU 9013!! Thank YOU SO VERY MUCH!!! <End Log> Closing Statement (Dr. ~~~): As expected, subject displayed symptoms of severe anxiety towards end of interview; further questioning regarding object or its effect on village deemed unnecessary at present time.

The shell was then observed for any anomalous activity. Results: Shell remained motionless until D-95511 removed his blindfold,<br> at which point it began rolling around rapidly in his direction. It collided with him within seconds and subsequently rolled onto the floor where it took approximately 15 seconds to reorient itself before returning to its original position adjacent to him. He shortly afterwards began showing signs of confusion so he was instructed to sit down until he regained his composure after which he was administered a Class A Amnestics pill and released from testing. Notes:: The above test suggests that <i>SCP-639-GPT</i> is capable of registering if someone is looking at it or not, although there may be other factors involved in this process that have yet been determined (such as whether or not they can perceive light through their eyelids)<br>. Test #: 2 Test Subject: D-<br>95512 Procedure: Subject was instructed to put on a blindfold and then pull a lever releasing the shell from its containment box twice in rapid succession with only one minute between each release.
