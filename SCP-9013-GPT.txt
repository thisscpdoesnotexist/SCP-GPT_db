No recording devices are allowed in <i>SCP-9013</i>'s containment cell.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9013</i> appears to be a human female, approximately mid-twenties in age. It is unknown if <i>SCP-9013</i> has always been in this form, or if it was changed when it gained its anomalous properties. The only noticeable difference between <i>SCP-9013</i> and an ordinary human are its eyes; they are black with white sclerae, have no irises or pupils, and lack any sort of reaction to light.<br><br><i>SCP-9013</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it looks at a person or animal that can perceive images (this includes photographs). When this happens, the target will turn into stone within five minutes of being seen by <i>SCP-9013</i> . This process takes about three minutes after the target ceases viewing <i>SCP-9013</i> . All matter inside the body is turned into stone as well. If all nonessential tissue is removed before turning into stone, then the affected individual can live indefinitely in this state once transformed. Affected individuals are unable to move or speak while they are petrified , but appear to be fully conscious and aware of their surroundings while petrified . They retain any memory they had before being transformed . Any objects currently held by an affected individual will also transform with them; however , if such objects include clothing and other items covering parts of the body not already turned to stone , then these items may stay mobile for several seconds after turning to stone along with their wearer/holder .<br><br>Shortly after transforming someone into a statue via petrification , SCP - 9 013 will erase all memories associated with that person from everyone who knew them (including friends , family members etc.) unless such memories were stored on some type of recording device prior to erasure . The method by which these memories disappear remains unknown ; however , amnesiacs usually recover within two weeks following erasure without outside intervention. However , if one remembers anything about the person whose memory was erased (such as names ) even though he/she can no longer remember anything else about him/herself (e.g., what she does for a living), then he/<br>she will fall under effects similar effects like those described below: After seeing SCP - 9 013 again for more than 2 minutes (except during testing), such persons become unaffected by her abilities and may remember everything about that person again; however they become mute whenever talking directly about them [ see addendum]. Persons who recover from amnesia due to this effect report suffering from severe paranoia whenever around people whom they<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9013</i> was recovered in New York City after the murder of ██ persons. The killer turned out to be ██████ █████████, a woman who had been arrested in connection with several murders one month prior. However, only two of the victims were found petrified (leaving it unclear whether or not she was responsible for all of them), and there were no witnesses to her crimes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9013.1 :</h3> Test Log<br><br><br>Test #: 9013-1 Subject(s): D-9013, a rabbit.<br><br><br>Procedure: <i>SCP-9013</i> and D-9013 were placed in an observation chamber and instructed to look at each other while researchers monitored their vital signs.<br> Result: <i>SCP-9013</i> petrified the rabbit after approximately 3 minutes of eye contact . <Begin Log><br> Dr ██████ : How do you feel?<br> D - 9 013 : [coughs] I'm fine. Just a cough, that's all . Nothing serious .<br> Dr ██████ : Do you know why we've brought you here?<br> D - 9 013 : [nods] Yeah, this is where that lady came from…that one who turned people into stone…right? Dr ██████ nods. SCP - 9 013 has not looked away from D - 9 013 for more than 2 minutes since entering the chamber earlier today; however, it appears not to have affected him yet. All nonessential tissue has been removed from various parts of his body beforehand in order to test how long he could survive if petrified . The researchers are observing these tests closely in case they turn out to be useful later on when creating amnesiacs resistant against SCP - 9 013's memory erasure abilities (see addendum).<br> Dr ██████ : What do you remember about her ? How did she look like ? You were there when she was arrested , right ? While staff members are monitoring his vitals , D - 9 013 is looking at the floor without saying anything for several moments before answering their questions. It appears as though something is bothering him but he does not want to talk about it with them at this moment due to being under Foundation custody or because of possible consequences for doing so outside of containment (e.g., being placed under arrest by police officers ). However, if asked again later on during testing or after release by staff members , then he may tell us what happened . Then again , perhaps he did see something which did not affect him but might still affect others (such as seeing her petrify someone) and that would explain why he may be reluctant or outright refuse to share information about what happened with Foundation personnel while detained (especially if this particular incident had nothing directly related with him). But maybe it will still be worth asking anyway once we know more about his situation outside of our control; however, if asked later on while still contained then there should be no need for concern since information gathered through such interviews could prove very useful indeed even though they may be biased depending on the person interviewed …<End Log><br> Addendum #2: On February 1st 2015 DR F███ tested whether individuals who had come into contact with an affected person via indirect means could also become affected by direct eye contact with <i>SCP-9011</i> using both human test subjects and various plant species belonging both alive and dead plants preserved in either liquid nitrogen or alcohol solution<br><br><h3>Addendum 9013.2 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br><br>Interviewed: D-9013 Interviewer: Dr.<br> ██████ Foreword: <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ██████ : Hello, D-9013. How are you feeling? You look a bit pale today…<br> D - 9 013 : I'm fine, really . I've been better but nothing too serious . Just a cold or something . Can't be sure yet though …[coughs] Dr.<br> ██████ : …[pauses for several moments before speaking again] So do you remember what happened when <i>SCP-9011</i> was arrested? You were there at the time, weren't you? [D - 9 013 nods] When she was arrested, did she say anything about why she did what she did ? D - 9 013 remains silent while looking at the floor for several moments before responding to their question. It appears that he is still not ready to talk about this with them just yet; however , it has become increasingly clear that this is due to being held by Foundation personnel rather than any direct consequence of seeing SCP - 9 013's abilities in action on him personally (e.g., amnesia). However , if asked again later on during testing or after release by staff members , then he may tell us what happened . Then again , perhaps he did see something which did not affect him but might still affect others (such as seeing her petrify someone) and that would explain why he may be reluctant</div>
