    <h3>Item #: SCP-30567 - Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan</h3>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-30567, dubbed "Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan," is an animate, traditional Japanese Noh mask that resembles the face of an old man with a serene, yet poignant expression. The item is crafted from cypress wood and painted with natural pigments. Testing has revealed that SCP-30567 dates back to approximately the 15th century. The mask exudes an aura that influences the emotional state of individuals within a 3-meter radius, inducing feelings of intense nostalgia and melancholic longing for a past that they have never personally experienced.</p>
<p>Subjects exposed to SCP-30567 report vivid memories of historical events and personal lives from varying time periods in Japanese history, particularly of the Muromachi and Edo periods. These memories are not identical between subjects and often are inconsistent with actual events, suggesting the mask may fabricate or alter memories directly. Prolonged exposure results in the subject's personality becoming secondary to the personas generated by SCP-30567's influence.</p>
<p>SCP-30567 was discovered in a closed auction house in Kyoto after reports of its employees experiencing shared 'hallucinations' of a past life involving intricate details of feudal Japan. The Foundation intervened, classifying the event as an EX-████ incident, and successfully secured and contained the artifact.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-30567 is to be contained within a standard secure artifact locker lined with lead and soundproofing materials. The locker is located at Site-███, inside a containment chamber designed to mitigate its anomalous effects. Access to SCP-30567 is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher and is to be granted only for research purposes.</p>
<p>Personnel entering SCP-30567's containment chamber must submit to a psychological evaluation before and after contact with the anomaly. Those exposed to the item are limited to 30 minutes of exposure per month to prevent long-term psychological effects. A rotating schedule for guards and researchers is enforced to minimize repeated contact with SCP-30567.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-30567 is removed from containment, a site-wide broadcast of white noise is to be activated to dampen the item's auditory-based effects, and all personnel are to wear industrial-grade noise-cancelling headphones until recontainment is confirmed.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Recovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-30567 was initially contained following several incidents at the auction house in Kyoto. Embedded Foundation agents responded to reports of shared hallucinations, observing employees speaking in archaic Japanese dialects and behaving as if they were samurai, artisans, and other figures from various historical periods. The affected individuals had to be administered Class-B amnestics post-recovery of the item.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 30567-A:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-84930</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to SCP-30567 for 5 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> D-84930 recalled being a rōnin during the Sengoku period, providing details of a battle that never aligned with historically recorded events.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject's memories faded within hours of exposure, and no long-term effects were observed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 30567-B:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-17291</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to SCP-30567 for 15 minutes, allowed physical interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> D-17291's personality shifted dramatically, adopting the mannerisms and speech of an Edo period geisha. Subject reported memories of "her" patron and a deep sense of loss over his death, despite no historical evidence to corroborate the story.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject returned to baseline personality 3 days post-exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 30967-C:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-60188</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to SCP-30567 for 30 minutes while listening to traditional Japanese music.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject became unresponsive as if in a trance, later recounting memories of being a carpenter who constructed temples. Details included specific carpentry techniques not known to the subject prior to exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject required extensive debriefing and showed reluctance to accept current reality. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 30967-D:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. █████</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> The doctor was exposed to SCP-30567 for a controlled 10-minute period under observation.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Dr. █████ experienced a profound connection to a supposed past life as a daimyō's advisor. Unlike D-Class subjects, Dr. █████ was able to clearly differentiate between induced memories and his own once the exposure ended.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. █████ volunteered for exposure and has requested further study into SCP-30567's capabilities of accessing collective unconscious archetypes as theorized by Carl Jung.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident 30567-█</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-30567 inexplicably activated outside its scheduled testing, affecting multiple research personnel and security staff across Site-███. The site's emergency white noise broadcast was engaged, and the affected personnel were swiftly administered amnestics. It is hypothesized that SCP-30567 can occasionally exhibit a greater area of influence than initially understood. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly to include random activation protocols.</p>
