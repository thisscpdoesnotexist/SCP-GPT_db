The door is to have two guards posted outside of it at all times, they must not let anyone enter or exit without O5 approval. Any personnel entering <i>SCP-15627</i>'s containment chamber must wear full body armor and carry an assault rifle with them at all times while inside of the room, they should also have a gas mask on their person if possible. A researcher will enter into <i>SCP-15627</i>'s containment chamber alone with a tape recorder and microphone. The researcher will then ask questions about anything he wants to know about <i>SCP-15627</i> for 30 minutes before leaving the room. After 30 minutes has passed MTF Sigma 6 will storm into the room after hearing gunshots from inside of it. They will then shoot at any moving object in sight until everything is down except for one thing which should be brought back up top for questioning/testing purposes .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 30 minutes had passed MTF Sigma 6 stormed into the room after hearing gunshots from inside of it. They found that only one researcher was alive who told them that he heard something growling behind him as soon as he turned around there was a large red caped man standing over him with what appeared to be claws coming out of his hands and teeth coming out his mouth, he said that these objects were trying to attack him but couldn't because they were being held back by something else which looked like another man wearing green overalls holding onto them by their necks , this being was also trying to attack him but couldn't move because its feet were stuck on some sort of platform made out of dirt . As soon as MTF Sigma 6 entered through the door all three figures disappeared right before their eyes along with any trace evidence left behind such as blood or bullet holes in walls or floors . All researchers involved in this experiment died shortly afterwards due to unknown reasons , autopsy reports show no signs on trauma but do show signs on extreme mental stress .</div>
