Requests for additional materials and laboratory equipment are to be submitted to the Site Director for approval prior to delivery.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9430</i> was first discovered by the Foundation when they were reported missing three months ago in their hometown of [REDACTED]. They are a group of three knights from the Middle Ages, who were sent through a dimensional rift to our reality. <i>SCP-9430</i> is able to communicate with each other and with personnel around them, though all communication is done in an unknown language.<br><br><i>SCP-9430</i> has been contained for six months at Site-20, during which time they have learned English; however their speech is still mostly incoherent and hard to understand. They are able to speak more clearly after consuming certain substances, specifically sugar and coffee products; this has increased their understanding of our language as well as ours regarding theirs. The substance that increases <i>SCP-9430</i>'s ability to communicate may be found in different forms such as candy or soda (attempts at providing these items have been successful). The use of other psychoactive drugs such as marijuana does not seem to alter or improve <i>SCP-9430</i>'s ability to communicate nor does it make it easier for them due personal preference.<br><br><i>SCP-9430</i> appears very friendly towards Foundation personnel and will try its best not only when interacting but also when communicating about objects or things that may be important for the Foundation regarding their stay here; however, since communication is difficult most information given by <i>SCP-9430</i> is vague or incomplete which makes it difficult for researchers around them study specifics on any subjects brought up by them.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9430</i> was discovered during a Foundation raid on a suspected Chaos Insurgency base located in [REDACTED]. While searching the area, they were found within one of the main buildings. Upon spotting personnel, <i>SCP-9430</i> tried to defend themselves and attack personnel with their weapons; however, after being subdued by medical staff they calmed down and allowed them to be contained without further incident.<br><br>Afterwards, <i>SCP-9430</i> was sent to a temporary containment cell until Site-20 could be built for them. It is believed that <i>SCP-9430</i> may have been captured or kidnapped by the Chaos Insurgency and then forced into fighting as part of their army due to their knowledge with weapons as well as their armor (see Addendum 9430-1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9430.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9430</i> armor analysis.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9430.2 :</h3> Test logs.<br><br>+ Test Log 9430.<br>1 - close test log Test 15 - Date: ‚ñà‚ñà/‚ñà‚ñà/<br>‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Foreword: The following is a list of food items that were requested by <i>SCP-9430</i> and their reaction to each item given. All substances have been provided in an oral form except for soda and coffee, which are to be administered intravenously through their arm port on the back of their neck. <i>SCP-9430</i> Reaction Result Notes Chocolate Bar (Milka) Extreme confusion; <i>SCP-9430</i> refused the chocolate bar and threw it onto the floor saying <i>"I told you last time! That's sugar!"</i>. Later on, they picked up the candy bar again but only held it in one hand while using the other to rub their chin as if trying to understand what exactly it was made of or used for. After several minutes passed without any significant change in behavior, <i>SCP-9430</i> placed down the chocolate bar and continued with the rest of its meal consisting of a spaghetti dinner served with meatballs and peas (favoured by all three instances). Sugar Cane Juice Positive reaction; after drinking from glass, they proceeded to drink another serving before asking <i>"where do you get this?"</i>. Provided with a small package containing ten more servings as requested by them; when asked what else we could give them, they replied saying <i>"more please."</i> Chocolate Bar (local grocery store brand) Negative reaction; after consuming two bites from candy bar, subject threw candy away before spitting out</div>
