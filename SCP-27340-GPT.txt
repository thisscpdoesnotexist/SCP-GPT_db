<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27340 is an anomalous spatial phenomenon resembling a localized abyss or a black hole, located at an abandoned observatory in ████, ███████. It measures approximately two meters in diameter and appears to possess sentience with behaviors akin to extreme social anxiety. SCP-27340 has been observed to repel any direct gaze, and attempts to observe it directly result in the manifestation of an opaque, impenetrable barrier of unknown composition, henceforth referred to as SCP-27340-1.</p>
<p>Remote viewing equipment similarly fails when attempting to capture its image directly. Notably, SCP-27340 does not exhibit any gravitational pull as expected of a black hole but instead seems to maintain a fixed position relative to the floor of the observatory. Observations suggest that SCP-27340 is aware of its surroundings, demonstrating distress via increased fluctuation of its boundary when exposed to large groups or loud noises.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-27340 must be contained within its original location at the abandoned observatory, which has been retrofitted to serve as its containment unit. A 10-meter radius around SCP-27340 is to be perpetually dimmed to maintain a low-light environment and reduce the possibility of unintentional observation from afar. Audio dampening technology is installed to keep ambient noise levels at a minimum.</p>
<p>Personnel interactions with SCP-27340 are to be conducted individually, and noises should be kept below 40 decibels to prevent distress. When necessary, indirect observation through periscopic equipment and non-visual sensors is permitted, provided the sessions last no longer than fifteen minutes to prevent accidental direct observation.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-27340-1 manifests, all personnel must immediately cease any actions that could be perceived as observation and vacate the 10-meter radius until SCP-27340-1 de-manifests, which typically occurs within 30 minutes of achieving solitude.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-27340 was discovered on ██/██/20██ after local reports of "a piece of the night sky falling into the observatory". Mobile Task Force Psi-8 ("The Silencers") were dispatched and found the observatory abandoned, with SCP-27340 situated in the central observation chamber. Initial containment involved the evacuation and purchase of the surrounding property under a front company.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Incident Log A1</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, during a routine check, personnel inadvertently triggered SCP-27340-1 by attempting to photograph the anomaly. The barrier emerged and persisted for 47 minutes, longer than any previous manifestation. Upon SCP-27340-1's recession, all electronic devices used for the attempt were found to be inoperable.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log A2</h3>
<h4>Experiment A2-01:</h4>
<p>Purpose: To determine the effects of auditory stimuli on SCP-27340.
- A recording of classical music played at 35 dB.
- Result: No observable change in SCP-27340's behavior. </p>
<h4>Experiment A2-02:</h4>
<p>Purpose: To test SCP-27340's reaction to physical objects.
- A rubber ball was rolled towards SCP-27340
- Result: Ball redirected around SCP-27340, as if repelled by a magnetic field.</p>
<h4>Experiment A2-03:</h4>
<p>Purpose: To observe changes under increased noise levels.
- A mechanical metronome set to 60 dB.
- Result: Fluctuations in SCP-27340 increased, SCP-27340-1 manifested momentarily. </p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Interview Log A3</h3>
<p>Interview with Dr. ████, lead researcher of SCP-27340, regarding initial observations and hypothesis on SCP-27340's sentience.</p>
<h3>Addendum 5: Recovery Log A4</h3>
<p>Extensive logs detailing the acquisition of SCP-27340, including equipment used, environmental conditions, and personnel statements on initial encounters. </p>
<h3>Addendum 6: Update A5</h3>
<p>Changes made to containment procedures following the results of acoustic experiments, including revised noise-level limitations and required acoustic padding in the observatory.</p>
<h3>Addendum 7: Miscellaneous A6</h3>
<p>Copy of correspondence with Dr. ████'s proposed collaborative research with Site-██'s psychologists to develop communication methods tailored for non-conventional sentient beings. Approval pending.</p>
<h3>Addendum 8: Experiment Log A7</h3>
<h4>Experiment A7-04:</h4>
<p>Purpose: To test SCP-27340's limit to psychological stress.
- Increased occupancy within containment to five personnel, with whispering.
- Result: SCP-27340 fluctuated wildly; SCP-27340-1 manifested for 2 hours. Experiment aborted.</p>
<h4>Experiment A7-05:</h4>
<p>Purpose: To determine SCP-27340's response to indirect, non-visual attention.
- Personnel read aloud from a novel facing away from SCP-27340.
- Result: No adverse response; SCP-27340 remained stable throughout the reading.</p>
<h3>Addendum 9: Update A8</h3>
<p>Notice of a containment breach and immediate re-classification of SCP-27340 to Keter denied after a successful argument that the incident was provoked by excessive personnel stress rather than a natural change in SCP-27340's behavior.</p>
<h3>Addendum 10: Miscellaneous A9</h3>
<p>Ethical inquiry and subsequent revision of experimentation protocols ensuring SCP-27340's psychological welfare, emphasizing a non-invasive approach to further research.</p></div>
