Any personnel who have been exposed to <i>SCP-10343</i> are to be amnesticized and removed from the pool of female personnel at Site 19.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10343</i> is a poem written by Sappho of Lesbos, an ancient greek poet. The poem was found in ██████, Turkey in 200█. The following is a transcript of the poem:<br><br>Οὐκ ἐγώ ποτε μειλίχισα γυναικῶν τ᾽ ἀνδρῶν,<br><br>οὐ γὰρ ἔτι καλὸς ἦν τεῖχος τοῖσδε πατρωμένως.<br><br>I have not yet been smitten with love for women nor men, for this wall has not yet been broken down by my father.<br><br><i>SCP-10343</i>'s effect manifests when any human female reads it aloud and finishes the last line above (<i>SCP-10343</i>-1). Upon finishing <i>SCP-10343</i>-1, <i>SCP-10343</i> will cause the subject to become sapphic and attracted to other females who are also sapphic. This process will take approximately 5 minutes after reading <i>SCP-10343</i> for the subject to become fully sapphic and attracted only to other females who are also sapphic . Subjects will be able to recall their previous sexual orientation before reading <i>SCP-10343</i> but cannot remember anything about their previous sexual partners or attraction towards males of any kind (including attraction towards males that were previously considered attractive). Subjects affected by <i>SCP-10343</i> appear as if they were born as lesbians although they do not seem to know why they feel this way or how they became lesbians themselves (see interview log 103431). The effects of SCP - 1034 3 are permanent unless removed via amnestics . + Interview Log 103431 - hide block <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D - 45678 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr . █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D - 45678 was chosen at random from a pool of female personnel at Site 19 after being exposed to SCP - 1034 3 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr . <br><br><b>█████: </b>Please state your name and age for our records?

I would like to ask you a few questions about SCP - 10343. <br><br><b>████████: </b>Sure , go ahead , but please call me ████, everyone else does. Dr . ███: Alright then , Thank you for your cooperation Mr…um…███? <br><br><b>████████: </b>Yes that's right (laughs). So what do you want to know? Dr . ███: Well I noticed that this poem of yours seems to have some anomalous properties when read by women? How did you come up with it? <br><br><b>████████: </b>Oh yes that! It's funny actually, I wrote it as a joke for my girlfriend at the time and didn't think much of it after I wrote it. But then she showed it to her friends who loved the poem so much they wanted me to write more poems like this one! (Laughs) It was quite profitable at first but after awhile people started reading too many poems like these and they became boring so eventually I stopped writing them altogether. Shame really because those poems were really fun while they lasted though! Oh well! What can ya do eh?

After finishing <i>SCP-1034</i> 3 , subject was asked to describe her current sexual orientation and level of attraction towards other females. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reported being a lesbian with an attraction level of 9/10 towards other lesbians around her age. Subject's previous sexual orientation and attraction towards males is no longer present in subject's memory. Experiment 10343-2:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D - 45678, D - 45680 (Female, 22 years old) Subjects were instructed to kiss each other after reading <i>SCP-1034</i> 3 . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Both subjects immediately stopped kissing each other and stated that they did not find the experiment pleasurable in any way. Both subjects were then told that they would be terminated if they did not continue kissing each other for the rest of the experiment until completion or until one of them runs out of breath or passes out from lack of oxygen . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr . <br><br><b>█████: </b>Please continue your experiment as you were instructed before you left here today .

Medical report # 103431 indicates that prolonged lip contact between two humans can result in hypoxia which can lead up to death depending on how long it takes for the victim(s) affected by hypoxia get help i f there is none available nearby after passing out due to prolonged lip contact between two humans' mouths and tongues. + Interview Log 103432 - hide block <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Agent C███████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Agent C███████ was chosen at random from a pool female personnel at Site 19 who had been exposed SCP - 1 0 343 after being exposed t o S C P – 1 0 34 3 but had not yet become sapphic nor attracted only towards females who are also sapphic (see interview log 1 0 34 32 ) < Begin Log > Dr . <br><br><b>██████████: </b>Please state your name and age for our records?
