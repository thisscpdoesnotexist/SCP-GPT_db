The girdle has been observed to have no visible seams or fastenings, and appears to be made from a single piece of material.<br><br>When worn by an individual, <i>SCP-17599</i> will cause the wearer to become completely unaffected by gravity. This effect extends to any objects that are in contact with the wearer's body, such as clothing or equipment carried on their person. While wearing <i>SCP-17599</i>, the user will remain suspended in midair regardless of how they move their body; they can move freely in all directions without being pulled down by gravity. Additionally, if the user were to be placed inside a vacuum chamber while wearing <i>SCP-17599</i>, they would remain suspended within it indefinitely until removed from the chamber or otherwise affected by outside forces.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17599</i> appear to be permanent for as long as it is worn; removing it does not restore normal gravitational effects upon its wearer. It should also be noted that this effect does not extend beyond the physical boundaries of whatever environment its user is currently occupying; once removed from said environment (such as through teleportation), normal gravitational effects are restored upon them immediately.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17599</i> is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17599</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Testing of <i>SCP-17599</i> must be approved by the Site Director and supervised by at least two (2) personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any personnel found wearing <i>SCP-17599</i> outside of approved testing scenarios are to be immediately detained and questioned as per standard protocol.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17599.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ involving <i>SCP-17599</i>. During the incident, a Class D personnel wearing <i>SCP-17599</i> was able to escape containment and remain airborne for approximately two (2) hours before being successfully re-contained.

Can you tell me anything about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17599</i>:</b> I am an ancient artifact that has been passed down through the ages.

The subject remained suspended within the chamber indefinitely, until removed after one hour. No adverse effects were observed.<br><b><br>Test #2:</b> A female subject was outfitted with <i>SCP-17599</i> and placed inside a standard containment cell at Site-██. The subject remained suspended within the cell indefinitely, until removed after two hours. No adverse effects were observed.</div>
