<h3>Item #: SCP-25691</h3>
<h3>Object Class: Keter</h3>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25691 appears to be a collection of physical manifestations that strongly resemble the character "Bugs Bunny" from Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated series. However, SCP-25691 exhibits anomalous properties and behaviors that are uncharacteristic of the fictional character, leading to the hypothesis that it is the embodiment of a trickster deity.</p>
<p>SCP-25691 has demonstrated an ability to violate natural laws, exhibiting toonforce-like powers that allow for reality warping, matter manipulation, and apparent invulnerability. These powers often manifest in a manner consistent with slapstick and cartoon logic; examples include the ability to produce mallets, explosives, and other items from thin air, flatten and then re-inflate itself, and rapidly recover from injury. Additionally, SCP-25691 has shown a degree of omniscience and the ability to teleport both itself and other objects at will.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-25691 have variable personalities but share a consistent, mischievous disposition and a penchant for chaos. While they primarily engage in non-lethal tomfoolery, the potential for catastrophic outcomes if SCP-25691's actions remain unchecked has necessitated its Keter classification. Communication with SCP-25691 is possible, but it often uses circular logic, wordplay, and other forms of deception to avoid providing straightforward answers.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to its reality-warping abilities and omnipresence, permanent containment of SCP-25691 has proven impossible. Current procedures focus on detection, rapid response, and minimization of public exposure to SCP-25691's activities.</p>
<p>Provisional Containment Task Force Delta-5 ("Looney Tunes") comprises agents trained in improvisation, cartoon physics, and negotiation tactics tailored to SCP-25691. PCTF Delta-5 is to be dispatched immediately upon detection of SCP-25691 activity.</p>
<p>Containment strategy involves deploying a mix of reality anchors and toonforce-inhibiting technology to constrain SCP-25691's abilities temporarily. In addition, PCTF Delta-5 agents are to engage SCP-25691 in dialogue, aiming to distract or persuade it to desist from its current course of action.</p>
<p>Any media depicting SCP-25691 is to be confiscated and classified, with cover stories disseminated as necessary. Amnestics are to be administered to all non-Foundation witnesses.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Report 25691-37</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-25691 caused a [DATA EXPUNGED] in New York City, leading to widespread panic and [REDACTED]. Foundation assets were deployed, and after approximately 3.4 hours, SCP-25691 was persuaded to reverse the majority of the damage. Witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics, and a cover story involving a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming movie was released to media outlets.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Interview Log 25691-42</h3>
<p>Interviewer: Dr. ███████</p>
<p>Subject: SCP-25691</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>Dr. ███████: Good morning. Can we talk about your actions during the incident last week?</p>
<p>SCP-25691: Eh, what's up, doc? You mean that little shindig with the [REDACTED]? I was just having some fun!</p>
<p>Dr. ███████: Your "fun" caused quite a bit of trouble. Can you explain why you did it?</p>
<p>SCP-25691: Trouble? Oh, I never mean no trouble. Just stirring up the pot, you know? Keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>Dr. ███████: We've noticed you seem to follow a pattern with your appearances. Can you tell us why you appear when you do?</p>
<p>SCP-25691: Oh, doc, that would spoil the surprise! And if there's one thing I love, it's a good surprise.</p>

<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log 25691-56</h3>
<p>Experiment Date: ██/██/20██</p>
<p>Objective: To test the limits of SCP-25691's reality-warping abilities and determine if there are consistencies in its behavior that could be exploited for containment.</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY - A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING DIFFERENT SCENARIOS ARE CONDUCTED]</p>
<p>Result: SCP-25691's abilities seem to have a thematic consistency adhering to cartoon physics and humor. While no clear limitations were observed, SCP-25691 appeared less inclined to utilize its powers in a harmful or destructive manner when engaged in what it perceives as comical interaction, suggesting a potential avenue for containment negotiation.</p>
