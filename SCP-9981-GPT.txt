The containment chamber itself is made of reinforced steel and concrete with a thickness of 5 meters. The room is kept at a temperature of -10°C to prevent <i>SCP-9980</i> from melting and escaping.<br><br><i>SCP-9981</i> infected subjects are contained in separate chambers for each individual subject, which are also made out of reinforced steel and concrete with a thickness of 5 meters. Each subject's chamber has been modified to allow for them to be fed intravenously as well as having their bodily waste removed via catheters so that they do not need to leave their chambers. Subjects are allowed no contact with any other humans besides researchers<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9981</i> is a phenomenon that occurs in the minds of humans, which causes them to believe they have superpowers and are capable of manipulating ice. The affected humans will be designated <i>SCP-9981</i>-1.<br><br><i>SCP-9981</i> is transmitted through physical contact with <i>SCP-9980</i>. It can also be transmitted through direct observation of <i>SCP-9980</i>'s abilities by an unaffected human, but this method has only been observed once so far. Once infected with <i>SCP-9981</i>, it will take 3 days for the effects to become apparent; during this time period, the subject will display no anomalous properties or symptoms. After 3 days, however, the subject's body will begin to slowly freeze from the inside out at a rate of 1 cm/day until it reaches absolute zero (-273°C). This process takes approximately 2 weeks and cannot be stopped or reversed by any means known to modern science (including cryogenic freezing). The process appears painless and does not appear to cause any discomfort in subjects; however, all subjects express extreme distress at their impending death from freezing at absolute zero as well as their inability to stop said death from occurring. Subjects also express great distress over being unable to prevent themselves from spreading <i>SCP-9981</i> once they have become infected (see Addendum 9980a for more details), although no attempts have been made by any subjects thus far due to their inability to leave containment chambers due their condition as well as lack of motivation caused by depression and despair over becoming frozen statues .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9981.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ████████, a <i>SCP-9981</i>-1 subject.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9981</i>-1 D-9981 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after it was discovered that D-9981 had been infected with <i>SCP-9981</i> for over 6 months without the Foundation noticing it due to his lack of contact with any personnel and the fact that he has been in cryogenic stasis for most of this time period. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello, D-9… D-9… uh… what is your name? Subject is silent for 5 seconds before replying in a monotone voice. Subject does not move its lips while speaking, but the words are still audible as if they were spoken normally by someone else in the room (later confirmed to be true). Subject appears to be unaware of their current condition; however, they do not appear distressed or depressed despite being frozen solid and unable to move or speak normally like this. Subject seems only able to communicate using telepathy; however, no attempts have been made by researchers so far at communicating back through telepathy due to concerns about security breaches caused by allowing infected subjects access inside secure facilities such as Site-[REDACTED]. [Subject's name] (SCP): My name is █████████ ████████ . I used to go by <i>"D"</i> when I was alive . Dr. ███: What happened? How did you get here? [Subject's <br><br><b>name]: </b>I got frostbite from direct contact with -10°C temperatures over an extended period of time . It took me 3 days after getting frostbite before my body started freezing itself from the inside out , which took 2 weeks until I became an ice statue like this one here . But during those 3 days , something else happened too … something worse than becoming an ice statue… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview, SCP-[REDACTED] was contained at Site-[REDACTED]. In order for more information about its properties and origin to be obtained , it has been decided that all future instances of SCP-[REDACTED] will be contained at Site-[REDACTED] as well Drs.[[Data Expunged]]<br><br><h3>Addendum 9981.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 9981.3:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-XXXXX-01, male, age 32 at time of experiment. Subject was infected with <i>SCP-9981</i> and placed in containment chamber with reinforced steel walls 5 meters thick. After 3 days of infection, subject showed no symptoms and continued to show no symptoms for the next 3 days after that. At the end of week 4, subject began to freeze from the inside out at a rate of 1 cm/day until he reached absolute zero (-273°C). Subject expressed extreme distress over his impending death from freezing as well as his inability to prevent himself from spreading <i>SCP-9981</i> once he had become infected (see Addendum 9980a for more details). After 2 weeks and 3 days since initial infection, subject froze solid completely; however, his body did not shatter upon reaching absolute zero but instead remained intact albeit frozen solid . The body was later examined by Drs ██████ and ████████ who found that the brain had been completely frozen solid , although it had not shattered like other bodily organs such as bones or internal organs . The brain itself appeared normal except for a slight discoloration in certain parts; this discoloration resembled ice crystals forming on an object in extremely cold temperatures (see Addendum 9981b) . Due to this discovery, it is believed that <i>SCP-9981</i> grants its subjects powers similar to those possessed by <i>SCP-9980</i> but only allows them access to these powers if they are able to think clearly enough due their minds being kept at a temperature below -273°C. It is also theorized that these powers could be accessed by any human capable of thinking clearly while their brains are kept below -273°C via cryogenic methods or other means such as exposure to extremely cold temperatures; however, testing has shown that humans exposed directly or indirectly through observation must have been infected with <i>SCP-9981</i> beforehand (see Experiment Log 9981a) . Further experimentation regarding this theory is pending approval by O5 Command.<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-XXXXX-02 , female , age 34 at time of experiment .

At the end o f week 4 , s ubject began t o freeze from t he inside out at a rate o f 1 cm / day until she reached absolute zero (- 273 ° C ) ; however , unlike previous test subjects she did not express distress over her impending death nor did she express any desire t o spread S C P - 998 1 during said period despite having previously expressed great distaste towards infecting others w i th S C P - 998 1 during previous interviews ( see A d d e n d u m 999 0a fo r more details ) . After 2 weeks and 3 days since initial infection s ubject froze solid completely ; however , her body did not shatter upon reaching absolute zero but instead remained intact albeit frozen sol id like previous test subjects w ho displayed similar anomalous properties ( see A b s olute Zero Threshol d Theory for more details ) ; however it should be noted tha t subje ct's brain shat tered upon reaching abs olute z ero like all other test subjects thus far which suggests tha t there may be an upper limit on how much damage can be done before one's mind becomes unable ta lk coherently which would explain why subjec ts do n ot try an yt hing when they realize they have superpowers even though doing so would allow them freedom outside their chambers once again which could result in infecting others thus allowing them access back into society again even though doing so would inevitably lead back into their current situation where they are trapped within containment chambers unable t o escape due t o being turned int o statues made out ice which cannot move nor feel pain while slowly dying alone without anyone around who cares about them besides researchers who must watch helplessly knowing full well what will happen yet still can do nothing about it because it 's all part of some sick fucking joke played on us all just because we were born into this world where we're forced live our lives through hardships only meant for us whether we want too or not just because some asshole decided long ago <i>"hey let' s turn people into statues made out ice then make them suffer forever"</i> without ever giving us a choice whether we want too or not simply</div>
