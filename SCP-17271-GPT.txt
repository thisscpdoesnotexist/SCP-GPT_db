It is approximately 1.8 meters in height and has an average weight of 80 kilograms, although this varies depending on the type and amount of beans it contains. <i>SCP-17271</i> lacks any facial features or appendages, but appears to be capable of locomotion by shifting its body mass around its center of gravity.<br><br><i>SCP-17271</i>'s primary anomalous property is that it can cause extreme physical pain to anyone who comes within 10 meters (33 feet) of it without protective clothing or shielding. The intensity and duration vary based on the proximity to <i>SCP-17271</i>, with those closest being subject to severe pain for up to 15 minutes before subsiding. Those further away may experience milder discomfort for shorter periods, but will still be incapacitated for some time afterwards due to residual effects.<br><br>In addition, if <i>SCP-17271</i> makes contact with organic material such as skin or clothing it will instantly absorb them into itself without leaving any trace behind other than a slight discoloration in its surface coloration where the material was absorbed from. This process also causes immediate excruciating pain in whatever organism was touched by <i>SCP-17271</i> before absorption occurs; however, this effect dissipates almost immediately after absorption takes place regardless if the target survives or not.<br><br>Finally, when exposed to fire or other sources of extreme heat <i>SCP-17271</i> will rapidly expand in size until reaching maximum capacity before exploding violently releasing all absorbed materials along with a large number of bean fragments which are highly flammable and spread quickly over wide areas causing significant destruction wherever they land .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17271</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The walls of the cell are to be lined with a layer of fireproof material and any personnel entering must wear protective clothing and carry fire extinguishers at all times.<br><br>In addition, no organic material is to be brought into <i>SCP-17271</i>'s containment chamber under any circumstances as this could lead to an uncontrolled expansion event. If such an event does occur, personnel are instructed to evacuate the area immediately and contact Site Command for further instructions.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17271.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred when <i>SCP-17271</i> absorbed a large quantity of organic material from within its cell. The resulting expansion event destroyed the containment chamber and caused minor damage to adjacent areas before it was contained by personnel wearing fireproof suits. All personnel involved were treated for their injuries and all affected materials were recovered or replaced as necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17271.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17271</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team attempted to interview <i>SCP-17271</i> in order to gain further insight into its nature and behavior. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript:<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Can you understand us? Do you have any kind of consciousness?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17271</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Are you aware of your anomalous properties? Do you know what happens when people come near you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17271</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Do you know why you exist?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17271</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Do you have any other abilities besides the ones we already know about?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17271</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Is there anything else you can tell us?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17271</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><br><h3> Addendum 17271.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 17271-1<br><b>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to approach <i>SCP-17271</i> and make contact with it.<br><b>Result:</b> Upon making contact with <i>SCP-17271</i>, subject immediately experienced extreme pain before being absorbed into the entity. No trace of the subject was found afterwards.</div>
