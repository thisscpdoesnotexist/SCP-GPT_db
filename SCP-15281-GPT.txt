Did you think it would be aired later or were there any plans to do so? <br><br><b>███████: </b>It was pretty disappointing, sure, but I didn't think much of it at the time because they were already working on next season's episodes by then anyway and we had moved onto other projects in the meantime too since they'd already paid us for this one anyway so… yeah… Dr. ███: What can you tell me about <i>SCP-15281</i>?
