It has the ability to manipulate objects and communicate with humans through telepathy.<br><br><i>SCP-24027</i> has a positive attitude, often making jokes and trying to make people smile. It enjoys playing pranks and generally being mischievous but never maliciously so. Despite its incorporeal nature, it can interact with physical objects in various ways such as moving them, manipulating their properties or creating small amounts of force or energy fields around them.<br><br><i>SCP-24027</i> is also capable of producing light from its body which it uses for illumination purposes when interacting with physical objects or communicating with people telepathically. The intensity of the light produced by <i>SCP-24027</i> can be adjusted depending on what it needs at any given time and will usually dim itself if there are too many onlookers present during interactions between it and other individuals or entities.<br><br>When not interacting with anything else, <i>SCP-24027</i> will typically remain stationary in one spot while emitting a faint blue glow from its body. On rare occasions however, <i>SCP-24027</i> will wander around exploring its environment before eventually returning back to where it was originally found after some time has passed<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24027</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with a light source that can be adjusted depending on the needs of <i>SCP-24027</i> and personnel should ensure that it is kept well lit during interactions between it and other individuals or entities.<br><br>Personnel interacting with <i>SCP-24027</i> must remain aware of its incorporeal nature at all times and take appropriate precautions when dealing with it, such as wearing protective gear if necessary. If any physical contact is made, personnel are to immediately report the incident to their supervisor for further investigation.<br><br>In order to prevent possible containment breaches, all entrances and exits leading into or out of the containment chamber must remain locked at all times<br><br><h3> Addendum 24027.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-24027</i> was observed to have spontaneously produced a small amount of heat energy from its body which it then used to cook a hotdog for itself. This behavior has not been observed since.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24027.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24027</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-24027</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-24027</i>, how are you? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24027</i>:</b> I'm doing well! It's nice to meet you. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> That's good to hear. Can you tell me a bit about yourself? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24027</i>:</b> Sure! Well, I'm an incorporeal entity that has the ability to manipulate physical objects and communicate with people telepathically. I enjoy playing pranks and making people smile but never maliciously so. Other than that, I just like exploring my environment and learning new things! <br><b><br> Dr. ██████:</b> Interesting, thank you for sharing that with me. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24027</i>:</b> Not really, no. I just want to make sure that everyone knows that I'm not a threat and that I'm actually quite cool! <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 24027.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 24027.1:</b> To test the effects of <i>SCP-24027</i>’s light on physical objects, a small metal cube was placed in its containment chamber and illuminated with the entity’s light. After several minutes, it was observed that the cube had become slightly warmer to the touch. Further experimentation revealed that when exposed to <i>SCP-24027</i>’s light for extended periods of time, objects can be heated up significantly more than normal and even begin to glow faintly blue in color.</div>
