Instances are to be given toys and other objects designed for children of their apparent age group. All instances are to be monitored at all times by security personnel assigned to Site-██; any instance attempting to leave its cell is to be prevented from doing so and returned immediately.<br><br>All instances of <i>SCP-15263</i> -1 are allowed access to the following items:<br><br>One (1) stuffed animal (designated <i>SCP-15263</i> -2) One (1) toy car One (1) toy airplane One (1) box of crayons Two (2) coloring<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15263</i> is a lost episode of Sesame Street, and the only episode in the series to be rated TV-14. The episode first aired on November 23rd, 1978 at 3:30 PM EST. <i>SCP-15263</i> is a black and white segment featuring Cookie Monster attempting to bake cookies for his friends.<br><br><i>SCP-15263</i> begins with Cookie Monster entering his kitchen through the door on the left side of the screen, before noticing that he has no ingredients for cookies. He then exits through the door on the right side of screen, before returning with several items from outside (including flowers, leaves and rocks). He then proceeds to mix these items together in a bowl before placing them into an oven. After several seconds, he opens up an oven window and pulls out what appears to be a burnt cookie which he eats happily. The credits begin shortly after this point with <i>"Cookie Monster"</i> credited as both writer and director of <i>SCP-15263</i> .<br><br>After approximately ten minutes following broadcast of <i>SCP-15263</i> , all persons who viewed it began behaving as if they were under five years old; this includes adults who had been watching it while working or otherwise occupied at that time. This effect also affected television viewers who watched it later via reruns or recordings (see Addendum 15263/2). All affected persons have been designated instances of <i>SCP-15263</i> -1; their behavior has not changed since becoming instances except that they now believe themselves to be children between two and three years old . Instances are capable of functioning normally despite their mental regression; however they do not understand why they are able to do so despite being children . Instances believe that any object or action shown in media targeted towards children is designed specifically for them regardless of its actual purpose . They will attempt to use these objects even if doing so would cause harm or injury (see Addendum 15263/3). Due to their inability to comprehend why such actions would result in harm , instances are unable to learn from mistakes made during these attempts (see Addendum 15263/4). Although instances can speak normally , many have difficulty forming complete sentences due either lack experience speaking or having never spoken as adults prior becoming instances . Despite this speech impediment , all instances can communicate effectively using gestures ; some individuals may find speaking difficult but still prefer communicating using gestures rather than speech when given a choice by researchers assigned them (see Addendum 152634)<br><br>Instances possess highly limited short term memory ;<br><br><h3>Addendum 15263.1 : </h3>  <i>SCP-15263</i> was discovered on December 2nd, 2013 when the Foundation received reports of a television broadcast that affected all viewers. Agents were dispatched to the location where the broadcast was believed to have originated from (the home of ██████ ██████ in New York City) and confiscated <i>SCP-15263</i> -1 instances along with several other objects . All instances were found in a single room inside Mr. ██████'s apartment; they had been living there together for an unknown period of time prior to containment .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15263.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. L. M████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted three days after <i>SCP-15263</i> was recovered from Mr. ██████'s apartment . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. M████████: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████, my name is Doctor L██ M████████ and I'm here to ask you some questions about the children you were living with prior to their containment by the Foundation . You do not need to answer any of these questions if you do not want to; however your cooperation will help us better understand your situation . <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Oh, hi! Are you another kid? I don't know who else would be asking me about those kids… [Mr. ██████ pauses for several seconds before continuing] …though I guess it makes sense that adults would want to know what happened too since they're all little kids now . Is that why we're talking? <br><br><b>Dr. M████████: </b>Yes, that's correct; we have a few questions for you regarding the children and how they came into contact with <i>SCP-15263</i> . Can you tell me how long they've lived in your apartment? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Sure! Well… <i>"lived"</i> might be too strong of a word; they just kind of showed up one day and started living there with me! It was really weird at first because there wasn't anyone else in my building or anything so I thought maybe someone had broken in or something but then these kids just started showing up every day and eventually they were there all the time ! They didn't talk much at first either so it took them a while before we could communicate properly but once we did it got easier ! We'd play together every day , watch TV , eat ice cream… It was great ! And then one day this guy comes by and says he's going to take us away so I had to hide them in my room until he went away again… [Mr.] ​​​​​​[REDACTED] told me his name but I forgot it already ; sorry! Anyway, he never came back after that so things went back being normal for a while until this lady showed up saying she wanted everyone back on Sesame Street again ; she said she'd take us wherever we wanted as long as everyone got together again which sounded nice at first but then she tried taking us away from here against our will which made her seem pretty bad even though she did give us lots of food when we left ; oh man those cookies were delicious ! But anyway yeah like two weeks later this guy shows up saying he's gonna put on a show where everybody gets together again which sounds cool except now people are coming over trying to take everybody away again including me because apparently nobody can remember anything besides being little kids anymore ? So yeah like thirty minutes ago some guys finally showed up who seemed nice enough (and didn't try taking anybody anywhere) so here we are talking right now instead of getting taken somewhere else against our will like earlier today when those other guys came over …Dr.[REDACTED]'s been really nice too though sometimes he seems more interested in talking about stuff than actually listening when people talk back which is kind of weird especially since no one ever talks during Sesame Street anyways …oh also sometimes his eyes get really big whenever anyone mentions Cookie Monster even though Cookie Monster doesn't exist outside Sesame Street anyways unless maybe somebody watches him on YouTube or something …oh also sometimes his eyes get really big whenever anyone mentions Cookie Monster even though Cookie Monster doesn't exist outside Sesame Street anyways unless maybe somebody watches him on YouTube or something <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>No further information regarding <i>SCP-15263</i> -1 instances has been provided by Mr.[REDACTED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 15263.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15263-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2324, a Caucasian male in his late twenties. Prior to this experiment, he had been living with his parents and working at a local fast food restaurant. He was chosen for the first experiment due to having watched <i>SCP-15263</i> while alone; this meant that none of the other instances could have influenced his behavior during the test .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to play with <i>SCP-15263</i> -2 (a stuffed animal) as if it were alive.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject begins playing with <i>SCP-15263</i> -2 normally; however after several minutes he begins hitting it repeatedly while shouting <i>"Stop being so mean!"</i>. The subject then picks up <i>SCP-15263</i> -2 and throws it against the wall, causing its head to detach from its body .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Due to subjects limited short term memory , it is unable remember that <i>SCP-15263</i> -2 was not alive despite having interacted with it for several minutes beforehand. This indicates that instances are capable of learning from their mistakes when given enough time . Experiment <br><br><b>152634: </b><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-2324 is instructed to interact normally with all instances of <i>SCP-152634</i> <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately two hours and thirty five minutes, D 2324 enters an unresponsive state and remains motionless for three days before returning back into normal behavior . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears as though instances are incapable of learning from mistakes made by other people who they find more interesting than themselves; this may be due either their inability or unwillingness learn from others or their lack experience interacting socially outside their group . Experiment <br><br><b>152635: </b><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A researcher assigned to watch over all instances will attempt teach one how use crayons correctly. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After one hour, researcher becomes frustrated by subject's inability grasp concept of using crayons correctly ; she attempts demonstrate by drawing an apple on sheet of paper using them herself in front subject's view before handing him a sheet containing blank paper along crayon box instructing him draw apple as well. After approximately fifteen minutes has passed since beginning experiment , instance becomes frustrated and throws crayon box against wall before proceeding pick up pieces scattered across floor which he then proceeds throw across room again before picking up remaining pieces which he then eats off ground like candy bar despite protestation by researchers assigned watching him (see Addendum 152634). <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Instances can learn new concepts provided they are taught properly but cannot understand why doing something wrong would result in negative consequences unless shown directly ; this makes them highly suggestible towards those they consider authorities figures who they believe know what correct behavior should be (see Addendum 152636). Experiment 152636 Procedure Researchers assigned watching over all instances will give each one a toy car instructing them use it properly Results All subjects attempt drive car around room without success until researchers intervene pushing vehicle forward themselves ; after several seconds , subjects begin driving car around room without assistance but stop suddenly when reaching edge table whereupon crash into object knocking themselves unconscious upon impact (see Addendum 152637) Analysis Instances do not appear able learn how operate objects independently unless shown how first directly or indirectly through example but can still successfully operate objects even if doing so requires great effort on part individual performing task ; however once instance reaches point where said task requires too much effort , individual will become discouraged giving up entirely rather than attempting continue regardless resulting failure (see Addendum 152638). Experiment 1 5 2637 Procedure All individuals are placed inside standard humanoid containment cells Results All individuals attempt escape containment cell immediately upon entering regardless whether there present prior becoming instance except those who entered cell while alone such as D 2324 whose actions were monitored via security feed rather than direct observation at time became instance ; these individuals remain calm until approached by someone else whom they consider authority figure such as researchers assigned observing them at time became instance thereby prompting immediate escape attempt even if no other person present within cell during attempted escape besides individual attempting escape itself . Those who remained calm until approached another person remain calm even if no one approaches them throughout entire duration experimentation period except when sleeping whereby case become agitated upon waking up again regardless whether anyone present within vicinity including research personnel assigned observing them henceforth indicating possible cause agitation may be related presence nearby another human being instead actual physical contact between two parties involved leading theory behind cause lack sufficient social interaction outside family unit growing up prior becoming instance although exact reason remains unknown due to inherent difficulty studying long term effects isolation during childhood period</div>
