If any person attempts to touch <i>SCP-10233</i> while it is floating they will be [DATA EXPUNGED] because that would be stupid I mean come on now what kind of dumbass would do something like that? If you are reading this then you are one lucky sonofabitch because I'm telling you right now if you had tried touching him while he was floating then your ass would have gotten fucked up real bad trust me on this one okay? You don't want me coming down there and kicking your ass for trying something like that so just remember what I said here okay buddy? Good luck!<br><br><h3>Addendum 10233.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????-10233<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10233</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-10233</i>, my name is Dr. ██████ and I'm here to ask you a few questions about yourself okay? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10233</i>: </b>Okay cool! What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well for starters what is your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10233</i>: </b>My name is Mario! I'm the most famous plumber from the hit series of video games that have been released since 1985! You know Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros 2., Super Mario Bros 3., Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, and many more! They're all so great except for that shitty game they made in 1993 called <i>"Mario Is Missing"</i> that was just terrible and should be banned from existence along with anything else made by those assholes at [REDACTED]. That game was so bad that it gave me nightmares when I played it as a kid…and even now sometimes if I think about it too much…<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Okay then let's move on shall we? How did you get your powers? (<i>SCP-10233</i> begins to laugh) <br><br><b><i>SCP-10234</i>: </b>Oh man where do I start with this one?! It all started back in 1985 when Nintendo first started making those awesome games of mine but they couldn't figure out how to end them because they didn't want them to end at all because then people would stop playing them which would make less money for Nintendo which means less profit for them which doesn't work because then there will be no more money left over after paying their employees so what did they do about this problem huh?! They hired some guy who worked there named [DATA EXPUNGED] who had an idea on how he could make these games last forever without having anyone notice or care about it but he needed help from someone else in order for his plan to work properly so he went out into the town one night looking around until he found someone who was willing enough to help him out with his crazy plan…and that person turned out to be me! He told me everything he wanted me to do and why he wanted me too and after hearing him talk about his plan I agreed right away because it sounded like fun plus if we pulled this off we'd both become rich beyond our wildest dreams!! So we got started on our new project right away by doing some research into ancient magic spells written down by wizards long ago before moving onto making prototypes of my character using clay sculptures as practice before finally starting development on the actual video game itself….and boy oh boy were things ever fun back then!!! We were laughing, joking around, eating pizza while playing video games together every day like best friends until one day when [DATA EXPUNGED] came up with a new idea…..he wanted us both dead….soooo….we ran away together….but not before getting revenge against [DATA EXPUNGED] first…..I used my new found powers given unto me by being infused with ancient magic combined with science while [DATA EXPUNGED] tried fighting back using only science……but alas…..in the end……he lost……..and died……..alongside everyone else who worked at Nintendo except for myself of course…..because now thanks to my newfound powers granted unto myself through ancient magic combined with science thanks also go towards God Almighty Himself Himself Himself (At this point <i>SCP-10133</i> began sobbing uncontrollably) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement:: After interviewing 102333 Foundation personnel discovered several inconsistencies within 102333's story such as 1.) The fact that none of 102333's claims have ever been proven true 2.) The fact that no other person named <i>"God Almighty Himself Himself Himself"</i> has ever existed 3.) The fact that no evidence has been found supporting any claims made within 102333's interview 4.) And finally the fact tat if God Almighty himself existed than why would He allow something like 9/11 or any other tragedy take place within His creation<br><br><h3>Addendum 10233.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Experiment 10233-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10233</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10233</i> instructed to wear his blue cap and red overalls. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject began to float at a rate of 1 foot per second until it reached an altitude of 3 feet before descending back down to the ground at the same speed as it ascended. Subject was instructed to remove his hat and overalls. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject began to levitate at a rate of 1 foot per second until it reached an altitude of 3 feet before descending back down to the ground at the same speed as it ascended. <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>It is safe for <i>SCP-10233</i> to wear his hat and overalls while he is floating in order for him not be harmed by coming into contact with anything while he is floating. Experiment 10233-2<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10233</i> wearing blue cap and red overalls, D class personnel wearing standard issue orange prison jumpsuit with no shoes or socks on, 2 D class personnel wearing standard issue orange prison jumpsuit with no shoes or socks on, 2 D class personnel wearing standard issue orange prison jumpsuit with no shoes or socks on, 2 D class personnel wearing standard issue orange prison jumpsuit with no shoes or socks on, 1 D class personnel wearing standard issue orange prison jumpsuit with no shoes or socks on (D4), all 6 subjects were told that they would be participating in a game show where they had to try and touch <i>SCP-10333</i> without falling off the platform that they were standing upon <br><br><b>Results: </b>All 6 subjects stood upon platform without falling off for 15 minutes before subject asked if he could take off his hat because <i>"it was getting hot"</i>. Upon removing subject's hat all 6 subjects fell from their platforms resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>Subjects who attempt touch <i>SCP-10333</i> will fall from any surface that they are standing upon unless there is some sort of barrier between them and him such as walls etc… This also applies if subject attempts touch him through any transparent surfaces such as glass windows etc… It has been suggested that we use this ability against enemies during war time but I don't think anyone would want our soldiers touching those filthy terrorists even if we did use this ability against them so I don't think we'll be using this ability anytime soon but you never know right? We might have something like this up our sleeve when we go toe toe against those commie bastards over there in Russia so just keep your fingers crossed okay? That's all for today folks! See you next week!</div>
