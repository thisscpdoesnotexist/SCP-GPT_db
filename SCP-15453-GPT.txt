The mansion itself is completely empty except for one room which contains only a bed and a computer with internet access. This room also contained several documents written by <i>SCP-15453</i> describing various investment strategies that allowed him to become wealthy quickly through trading in the stock market as well as several notes on how to use bitcoin anonymously and safely (see addendum).<br><br><i>SCP-15453</i> has been able to make investments that are usually profitable within minutes of making them. For example, at one point during testing SCP-███ began attacking Site ████ causing major damage and loss of life while at the same time causing [DATA EXPUNGED] stock prices rose dramatically until they reached $████████ per share before falling back down again after [DATA EXPUNGED]. At this point Dr Bright ordered all Foundation personnel with stocks or bonds or other financial investments were told not sell them immediately but wait for further instructions from their superiors before doing so because if enough people sold their shares at once it could cause another crash like what happened just now which would cause more problems than we can handle right now." After this order was given Agent ███████ sold his entire portfolio consisting of $████████ worth of shares in various companies including [DATA EXPUNGED] causing their value to fall by over $████████ within seconds before being bought back up again almost immediately afterwards causing many investors panic selling which caused even more stocks prices drop until they were eventually bought back up again by investors who believed that this would be temporary like last time so they didn't want miss out on any future profits resulting from these low prices only for Agent ███████'s actions had caused an economic collapse worse than 2008's Great Recession resulting in millions dead as well as trillions lost worldwide due directly or indirectly due to his actions with most fatalities occurring when rioting broke out across America after Trump's election victory prompting martial law being declared across most states while riots spread throughout Europe<br><br><h3>Addendum 15453.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 15453.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15453, a convicted felon with a history of violence.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15453 was given $10,000 in cash and told to invest it in the stock market.
