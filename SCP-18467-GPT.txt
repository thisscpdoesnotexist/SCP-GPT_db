Upon contact, <i>SCP-18467</i> will rapidly absorb the mass of the target, transforming it into a metallic substance similar in composition to its own body. This process takes approximately one minute and produces no visible changes in the target until after completion. Once absorbed, the target cannot be removed from <i>SCP-18467</i>'s body without causing significant structural damage to both entities.<br><br>The only known method of containing <i>SCP-18467</i> is by encasing it in a container made from an alloy composed of iron and gold (known as <i>"dragonsteel"</i>). Dragonsteel containers are able to prevent further absorption by blocking all physical contact between <i>SCP-18467</i> and other objects or creatures; however, they have limited effectiveness against other forms of attack such as heat or electricity.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18467</i> is to be contained in a reinforced dragonsteel container at all times. The container must be checked for structural integrity on a weekly basis, and any damage must be repaired immediately.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18467</i> are not to make physical contact with it under any circumstances. Any personnel who do come into contact with <i>SCP-18467</i> are to be immediately removed from the containment area and placed in quarantine for observation until further notice.<br><br>In the event of an escape, all personnel within a 5 km radius of <i>SCP-18467</i>'s location are to evacuate the area and report their findings back to Site Command as soon as possible. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (<i>"Dragon Slayers"</i>) is then dispatched to recapt<br><br><h3> Addendum 18467.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18467</i> escaped containment and proceeded to absorb a total of ██ personnel before being re-contained. All personnel absorbed by <i>SCP-18467</i> were later found to have been transformed into metallic objects similar in composition to its own body.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18467.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> So, what can you tell me about <i>SCP-18467</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher █████:</b> Well, it appears to be a draconic starfish of unknown origin and composition. It's capable of locomotion and has been observed to move at speeds up to 50 km/h. It also has an anomalous effect that causes it to absorb any living creature or object that it comes into contact with, transforming them into a metallic substance similar in composition to its own body.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Interesting… Do you know of any way to contain it?<br><b><br>Researcher █████:</b> Yes, the only known method of containing <i>SCP-18467</i> is by encasing it in a container made from an alloy composed of iron and gold (known as <i>"dragonsteel"</i>). Dragonsteel containers are able to prevent further absorption by blocking all physical contact between <i>SCP-18467</i> and other objects or creatures; however, they have limited effectiveness against other forms of attack such as heat or electricity.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18467.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18467.1:</b> <i>SCP-18467</i> was placed in a standard containment chamber and exposed to a live animal of average size. Upon contact, the animal was rapidly absorbed by <i>SCP-18467</i>, with no visible changes occurring until after completion.<br><b><br>Experiment 18467.2:</b> <i>SCP-18467</i> was placed in a reinforced dragonsteel container and exposed to an electrical current of increasing intensity. After five minutes, the current had no effect on <i>SCP-18467</i>'s behavior or physical state, indicating that it is immune to electricity.</div>
