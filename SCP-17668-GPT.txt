It speaks fluent English, though its voice is extremely high pitched and often difficult to understand. <i>SCP-17668</i> displays signs of sapience, but does not seem to have any knowledge beyond basic facts about Wonderland or its inhabitants.<br><br>When provoked or threatened by personnel, <i>SCP-17668</i> will become hostile and attempt to flee from containment using whatever means necessary. If unable to escape it will resort to violence against personnel if they attempt physical contact with it. When left alone for extended periods of time it will become increasingly agitated until eventually attempting escape again; however this behavior can be prevented by providing it with food items such as candy bars or other sweets every few hours while in containment.<br><br>Due to the potential threat posed by <i>SCP-17668</i>'s unpredictable behavior and unknown capabilities, it is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times when not under direct observation by personnel trained in dealing with sapient anomalies (Level 3 Clearance Required).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17668</i> is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times.

If interaction is required, it should be done in a manner that does not provoke or threaten the entity in any way.<br><br>Any food items provided for <i>SCP-17668</i> must be approved by a Level 4 Res<br><br><h3> Addendum 17668.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17668</i> was observed speaking in a language unknown to personnel.
