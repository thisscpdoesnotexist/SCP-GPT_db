As such, all personnel are instructed to avoid attempting to kiss their own elbow under any circumstances and report any sightings of <i>SCP-17087</i> entities immediately.<br><br>In addition, research into methods for controlling or reversing the transformation process is ongoing; however no progress has been made thus far.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17087</i> is a phenomenon in which individuals are able to bend their arms in such a way that they can kiss their own elbow. This ability appears to be largely impossible, as the human body does not typically possess the flexibility or range of motion necessary for this feat.<br><br>When an individual attempts to kiss their own elbow, they will instead experience a brief moment of intense pain and disorientation, followed by an involuntary transformation into a humanoid entity composed entirely of light. This entity will appear similar in form and size to the individual prior to transformation and will possess all memories and abilities of the original subject, though its physical capabilities are greatly enhanced.<br><br>The transformed entity is capable of flight at speeds up to Mach 5, has superhuman strength and durability, can generate force fields powerful enough to deflect bullets or other projectiles with ease, possesses telekinetic powers capable of lifting objects weighing up to 10 tons with minimal effort and demonstrate various other abilities related to manipulating energy fields. The transformed entities have also been observed displaying some degree of omniscience regarding any given situation they encounter; however it appears limited by unknown factors as they do not always act upon this knowledge.<br><br>In addition, <i>SCP-17087</i> entities have demonstrated immunity from conventional forms of damage or injury; only powerful sources such as nuclear weapons have been observed causing them harm or destruction on any meaningful scale. It is currently unknown how long these transformations last before reverting back into normal human form; however it is believed that prolonged exposure may cause permanent changes within the individual's physiology or mental state over time due its connection with extradimensional energies beyond our current understanding.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17087.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a large group of <i>SCP-17087</i> entities were observed gathering near the site of a nuclear test in [REDACTED], prompting an investigation by Foundation personnel. It is currently unknown why the entities had gathered at this location or what their purpose was; however it is believed that they may have been attempting to absorb energy from the detonation for some unknown purpose.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17087.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/████, Foundation personnel were able to capture one of the <i>SCP-17087</i> entities and conduct an interview with it. The entity identified itself as ████████ █████████, a former resident of [REDACTED] who had attempted to kiss their own elbow on the day of the nuclear test. When questioned regarding its motives for gathering at the site, it stated that it was attempting to absorb energy from the detonation in order to <i>"gain greater understanding"</i> and become <i>"truly enlightened"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17087.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>17087-1: </b>A human subject was instructed to attempt to kiss their own elbow. <br><br><b>Result: </b>Subject experienced a brief moment of intense pain and disorientation before transforming into an <i>SCP-17087</i> entity composed entirely of light. Entity demonstrated superhuman strength, durability, and various other abilities related to manipulating energy fields as described above. Entity then proceeded to fly away from the testing site at speeds up to Mach 5 before disappearing from sight.</div>
