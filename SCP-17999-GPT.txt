This effect extends up to approximately 20 meters from the entity; any individual within this radius will experience intense feelings of attraction towards <i>SCP-17999</i> regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. As such, individuals affected by this phenomenon are likely to attempt to initiate contact with <i>SCP-17999</i> despite their own better judgment or existing relationships.<br><br><i>SCP-17999</i> is capable of speech in several languages but prefers not to communicate verbally due to difficulty understanding social cues and context when interacting with others. It has expressed interest in learning more about humans and other sapient species but does not appear motivated enough for sustained study or research on the subject matter.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17999</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell is to be equipped with soundproofing and other sensory dampening features, as well as a bed and basic amenities.<br><br>Personnel interacting with <i>SCP-17999</i> are to wear protective gear including face masks, gloves, and full body suits when within 20 meters of the entity. All personnel must also undergo psychological evaluations before and after any interaction with <i>SCP-17999</i>.<br><br>Any individuals affected by <i>SCP-17999</i>'s pheromones are to be monitored for signs of distress or mental instability; if necessary, they may receive psychological counseling or medication as needed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17999.1: </h3> Discovery<br><br><i>SCP-17999</i> was discovered in ███████, Japan after reports of a woman with unusual abilities attracted the attention of local law enforcement.
