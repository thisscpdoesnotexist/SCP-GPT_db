<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18190 is  all positive emotions. That's right: positive emotions are abnormal and anomalous. Negative ones are normal.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18190<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18190</i> is an anomalous phenomenon affecting the emotions of all sentient beings. All emotions experienced by affected individuals are positive in nature, regardless of any external stimuli or events. Affected individuals will report feeling contentment and joy, even in situations that would typically evoke negative feelings such as grief or fear.<br><br>The area of effect for <i>SCP-18190</i> is limited to a radius of approximately 10 kilometers around its point of origin, located near ██████████, USA. The exact cause and source of <i>SCP-18190</i> are currently unknown.<br><br>Attempts to contain <i>SCP-18190</i> have been unsuccessful due to its persistent presence within the affected area; any attempts at removing it from the area result in immediate reemergence upon leaving the boundaries. It has been theorized that this may be due to some form of extradimensional origin or influence, though further research into this hypothesis is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the lack of a viable containment solution, personnel are to monitor the affected area for any changes in <i>SCP-18190</i>'s behavior or effects. Any individuals entering or leaving the affected area are to be monitored and interviewed regarding their emotional state before, during, and after their visit.<br><br>In addition, research into possible methods of containing <i>SCP-18190</i> is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18190.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an individual (designated <i>SCP-18190</i>-1) was discovered within the affected area. This individual displayed no anomalous properties beyond those associated with <i>SCP-18190</i> and was deemed to be a non-anomalous human subject. Interviews conducted with <i>SCP-18190</i>-1 revealed that they had been living in the area for approximately two years prior to discovery and had not experienced any negative emotions during that time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18190.2: </h3> Interview with a local resident<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> [REDACTED], a resident of the affected area.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> How have you been feeling since <i>SCP-18190</i>'s emergence? <br><b><br> Interviewee:</b> I feel really good all the time, no matter what's going on around me! Even when something bad happens, it doesn't bother me as much as it used to. It's like nothing can bring me down anymore!<br><br><h3> Addendum 18190.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>The following experiment was conducted to ascertain the effects of <i>SCP-18190</i> on non-sentient entities.<br><b><br>Subject:</b> One (1) domesticated housecat (Felis catus).<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> The subject was placed within the affected area and monitored for any changes in behavior. All observations were recorded and documented.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After approximately five minutes, the subject began displaying behaviors typically associated with positive emotions, such as purring, rolling around, and rubbing against objects or individuals present. These behaviors persisted until the subject was removed from the affected area; upon exiting its boundaries, it returned to its normal behavior patterns.</div>
