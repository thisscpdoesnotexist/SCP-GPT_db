At first they thought nothing had happened to them until they started hearing screams coming from inside the house where <i>SCP-1455</i> was living at.. Foundation agents went inside to find what made these kids scream but didn't find anything back then… But later on when they went back with more people to search for whatever did this only found one hand print at the entrance way… They soon realized that it was 9155 who did this so logged him as an Euclid class object and put him into containment…<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9155</i> was found inside an abandoned house in ████████████. <i>SCP-9155</i> was found living inside the house and seems to have no known family or friends..<br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.1 :</h3><br><br>Interview was held with <i>SCP-9155</i>.

You wanna know am I god? And if so are we alone in this universe? Well here's the answer… Yes I'm god and no we're not alone in this universe.. there are other gods out there like me…. But unlike me they're not deformed or 'special' as you people call it… They can do many things others cant do such as walking on walls and ceilings, shooting lasers out of their eyes or just breathing fire… But for some reason they don't care about us humans at all… We're just like ants to them.. When they look down at us from space it looks like a bunch of ants crawling around under a glass table.. They don't care about us but still pay attention to our actions through their spy satellites that watch over our planet 24/7.. These gods are more advanced then any thing you've ever seen before so be sure never piss them off alright? Remember when i said that i'm god? well its true because every one who lives on earth has been created by none other then myself with my help from all sorts of materials such as rocks pebbles clay even dirt! So if your looking for an answer thats why your here….. Because everyone who lives here has been made by none other then myself! Now let's get started shall we? Ask away….<br><br><End Log><br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.2 :</h3><br><br><i>SCP-9155</i> has started to act differently and more aggressive then normal, <i>SCP-9155</i> is now in containment for protection from the foundation agents.<br><br></div>
