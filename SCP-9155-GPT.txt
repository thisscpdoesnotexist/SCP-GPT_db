The cover features a picture of an orange cat with the title and author's name on it.<br><br>When a subject reads <i>SCP-9155</i> and encounters text referencing themself, the story will change to reflect their thoughts and actions as they read it. These alterations will only occur while the subject is reading; once they have finished or stopped reading, any changes made will return to normal. If the subject reads more than one chapter at once, each chapter must be read individually for changes to appear. Subjects who are not referenced in any way by <i>SCP-9155</i> do not experience this effect; those who read more than one chapter at once can still experience alterations if they are mentioned by name in another chapter they do not currently possess knowledge of (See test log).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9155</i> was recovered from a used bookstore in ████████, Sweden. The store had been experiencing a high level of stock turnover, which was attributed to an <i>"unusually good book"</i> displayed on the front shelf. A customer purchased the book and brought it to the Foundation's attention shortly after reading it.<br><br><br>Test Log: Test 9155-1<br><br><br>Subjects: D-9155-01 through D-9155-06<br><br><br>Procedure: Six Class D personnel were introduced to <i>SCP-9155</i> and told they would be taking turns reading it aloud for an hour each day until further notice. No instructions on how to read it were given beyond that. Each subject was then sent into a soundproof room one at a time for their allotted hour with instructions not to open or attempt to read any other pages before being told by testing staff. Once all subjects had finished reading, they were debriefed and released back into normal duty at Site 76 without<br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.1 :</h3><br><br>Test 9155-2<br><br><br>Subjects: D-9155-01 through D-9155-04, plus one Level 3 researcher.<br><br><br>Procedure: The same procedure as Test 9155-1 was followed, except the Level 3 researcher was told he would be reading the book to himself while subjects 01 and 02 read it aloud. He was given a copy of <i>SCP-9155</i> and told to begin reading while the other two began theirs. All four were then sent into separate soundproof rooms for their allotted time period. Once all four had finished reading, they were debriefed and released back into normal duty at Site 76 without incident, although all were asked about any unusual effects they may have experienced during their readings. The researcher reported nothing unusual; subjects 01 and 02 both reported that they felt like someone else was in the room with them at times during their respective readings (this is roughly consistent with what happened). The remaining two subjects did not report any anomalies during their times in the rooms after finishing reading.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.2 :</h3><br><br>Test 9155-3<br><br><br>Subject: D-9155-04, one Dr. ██████ (level 4 researcher), one D-class personnel (D-9155-05)<br><br><br>Procedure: The same procedure was followed as Test 9155, except that when subject 04 finished reading the book aloud, both Dr. ██████ and D-9155 were allowed to read it in their own time without any other restrictions imposed upon them. They were kept in separate rooms during this period and given access to food and water as needed, although at no point did either leave their respective rooms for any reason or bring anyone else into them besides testing staff. Once they had finished reading the book they were both debriefed separately and released back into normal duty at Site 76 without incident.</div>
