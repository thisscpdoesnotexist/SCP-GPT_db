They demonstrate no anomalous properties when not grouped with at least 6 other instances, but they do seem to possess the ability to cause people who see them in pairs/groups of two or more, or outnumbering themselves (regardless of whether they belong in their own pair/group) to experience feelings of extreme discomfort and confusion.<br><br><i>SCP-9155</i> were discovered in [REDACTED] in the possession of PoI-9023 (<i>"The Crazy One"</i>) during a raid by MTF Phi-10 (<i>"Holy Hand Grenades"</i>). PoI-9023 claimed that the stones had been given to him by his <i>"friend"</i> (see Addendum 9155.1). When questioned about what the purpose for these stones were, PoI-9023 responded with <i>"They're special."</i> Despite this assertion, he was unable to provide any further information on them beyond stating that his friend told him that they were <i>"important"</i>. It is unknown if he actually knew anything more about them or if he was simply attempting to avoid being detained by claiming amnesticization would be unnecessary. Regardless, it is theorized that <i>SCP-9155</i> have some connection with <i>SCP-</i>█████ due to their high levels of mutual memetic resistance and similar appearances.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9155</i> was recovered from a small village in [REDACTED] by MTF Phi-10 on ██/██/████ after word of their anomalous nature had reached the Foundation. The group had been gathering them up and selling them to tourists as <i>"special rocks"</i> for approximately one year before they were discovered. PoI-9023 was caught selling <i>SCP-9155</i> to an undercover agent who reported him soon after.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.1 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br><br>Interviewed: [REDACTED]<br> Interviewer: [REDACTED] <Begin Log> [REDACTED]: I… think I've seen you here before. You always come around the same time every week and buy a bunch of rocks from that crazy guy who goes around telling everyone how special they are. [REDACTED]: Oh yeah, him. He's kind of funny in an annoying way, but there's no denying that he really likes to sell these things. They're just rocks for crying out loud! What if someone ends up buying them and gets mad when they realize there isn't anything special about them? That'd be bad for business! He shouldn't be lying to people like that! Right? Right?! (At this point, PoI-9023 becomes visibly distressed.)<br> PoI-9023: Please… don't talk about my friend like that! It's not his fault, I promise! He just wants to help people feel better is all! There was nothing wrong with those rocks until you got your goons to take them away from me so they could put them in their silly little containment chamber or whatever it is you do with things like this - now look what they've done!!! (PoI-9023 begins wailing uncontrollably.) <End Log><br> Closing Statement: After this interview took place, PoI-9023 was deemed too mentally unstable for questioning and subsequently released after being given Class A amnestics.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9155.2 :</h3> Document #9155-1<br><br><br>Document #9155-1: A collection of recovered documents written by PoI-9023.</div>
