This effect extends to any form of death, including natural causes, accidents, and violence.<br><br>When an individual with sufficiently thick thighs enters a room containing another individual in danger of imminent death, the victim will be protected from harm. The protection lasts for as long as the individual with the thick thighs remains in close proximity to the endangered person; however, once they leave or are removed from the area, their protection dissipates and said individual is vulnerable again.<br><br>The exact thickness required for this effect to occur has yet to be determined; however it appears that thicker legs provide greater protection than thinner ones. Additionally, it appears that individuals must be aware of their protective capabilities in order for them to take effect; otherwise they cannot provide any form of defense against potential danger. Furthermore, no other body part or physical attribute has been found capable of providing similar effects when substituted for thigh size/thickness (e.g., arm circumference).<br><br>It should also be noted that <i>SCP-23885</i> does not appear to have any adverse effects on those being protected by its effects; rather it simply prevents them from coming into harm’s way while under its influence.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-23885</i>, it is impossible to reliably contain or control its effects. As such, no containment procedures have been implemented for this anomaly.<br><br>Research into <i>SCP-23885</i> is ongoing in order to better understand and predict its behavior. All personnel assigned to research projects involving <i>SCP-23885</i> are required to wear protective gear at all times when working with the anomaly in order to minimize potential risks associated with exposure.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23885.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ when an individual with thick thighs was able to protect several researchers from harm during the incident. The individual was later identified as Dr. ██████, who had been unaware of their protective capabilities prior to this event.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23885.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-23885</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, Dr. ██████ interviewed an individual who claimed to be aware of the protective capabilities of their thighs. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, what can you tell me about your thighs?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> Well, I guess it all started when I was a kid…I noticed that whenever I was in danger or around someone else who was in danger, my legs seemed to protect them from harm. It's like they just knew when something bad was going to happen and would act accordingly. It's kind of hard to explain but it's like they have some sort of instinctive knowledge that helps keep people safe from harm.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Interesting…have you ever tested this theory?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> Yeah, I've been in a few situations where I was able to protect others from danger just by being near them. It's almost like my legs can sense when something bad is about to happen and they take action before it does.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you think this is something that could be passed down to other people?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> I'm not sure…I've never really thought about it before. But I guess it's possible, if someone has the same kind of thighs as me then maybe they could benefit from the same protection too.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23885.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a series of experiments were conducted in order to test the effects of <i>SCP-23885</i>. The following is a summary of the results:<br><b><br>• Experiment 1:</b> Two individuals, one with thick thighs and one without, were placed in a room filled with hazardous materials. The individual with thicker thighs was unaffected by the hazardous materials while the individual without them was severely injured.</div>
