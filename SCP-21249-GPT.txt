<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21249 is  the phenomenon of ducks sabotaging plane engines</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21249<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21249</i> is an anomalous phenomenon in which ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) exhibit a behavior of sabotaging plane engines. This includes, but is not limited to, blocking air intakes with their feathers and excrement, nesting within the engine compartment, and attempting to peck at moving parts.<br><br>When a duck successfully sabotages a plane engine, it will then fly away from the area without any further interference. It appears that this action is intentional as the duck will have been seen flying near the aircraft prior to its sabotage attempt.<br><br>The exact cause of <i>SCP-21249</i> is unknown; however, it appears that ducks are attracted to planes due to their loud noises and bright lights. Additionally, ducks may be drawn towards planes due to their curiosity or territorial instinct.<br><br>Attempts at deterring ducks from airplanes have proven ineffective thus far. All attempts at capturing or containing affected birds have also failed due to their high agility and speed in flight. As such, personnel are advised against attempting capture/containment operations as they may result in injury or death of personnel involved if unsuccessful.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-21249</i>, no containment procedures are currently in place. Instead, personnel are advised to take measures to prevent ducks from accessing plane engines and other aircraft components.<br><b><br>These measures include:</b><br>* Installing netting or other physical barriers around air intakes and other vulnerable areas of the aircraft; <br>* Utilizing sound deterrents such as loud noises or ultrasonic frequencies; <br>* Employing chemical repellents around vulnerable areas; <br>* Training personnel on how to identify and respond appropriately if a duck is spotted near an airplane.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21249.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a flock of ducks was seen in the vicinity of [REDACTED], a small airport located in [REDACTED]. Witnesses reported that the birds were flying around the aircraft and attempting to block their engines. All attempts at dispersing the flock proved unsuccessful.<br><br>The incident resulted in several delays and cancellations of flights, as well as damage to two airplanes due to engine failure caused by <i>SCP-21249</i>. The affected planes had to be grounded for repairs before they could resume operations.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21249.2: </h3> Interview with a duck<br><br>On ██/██/████, personnel were able to capture an affected duck and conduct an interview. The following is a transcript of the interview: <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What are you doing here? <br><b>Duck:</b> I'm just looking for food. <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Why do you keep sabotaging plane engines? <br><b>Duck:</b> It's fun! I like the noise and lights. Plus, it's a great way to get food. <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Do you know that your actions can cause harm to people? <br><b>Duck:</b> No, I didn't know that. I'm sorry. <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Do you think you will stop sabotaging plane engines now that you know? <br><b>Duck:</b> Yes, I'll try to stay away from planes in the future.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21249.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log Date:</b> ██/██/20██ <br><b>Subject:</b> Anas platyrhynchos (duck) <br><b>Procedure:</b> A single duck was placed in a large enclosure with an airplane engine. The engine was then activated and monitored for any signs of sabotage. <br><b>Results:</b> After approximately five minutes, the duck began to peck at various parts of the engine. It successfully blocked one air intake with its feathers and excrement before flying away from the area.</div>
