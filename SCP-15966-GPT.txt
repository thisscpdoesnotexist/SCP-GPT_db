Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Well…I was assigned to go there and look for any signs of life or activity in the area. So I went there with a few other agents and we started searching the house for any clues about who lived there or if they had been taken by an anomaly or something like that…when we found this tape recorder in one of the rooms…<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please continue with your story, Agent ████ Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>We were going through all of their belongings when we found it…and so we decided to take it back with us because it seemed harmless enough and didn't seem like anything dangerous was nearby….but then when I got back here, one of my friends played it on his tape player and he just started screaming at some point during the song….and then he started bleeding from his eyes and ears….we tried everything to help him but nothing worked…..he died a few days later after being treated here at Site 19…..it was horrifying Drs.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15966.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15966-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15966, a female Caucasian of age 23.

This may be due to some sort of memetic effect caused by the video itself or an anomalous property inherent in the song "</i>The Insanity". Further testing is required before we can determine which one is true . -Dr ██████ Experiment <br><br><b>15966-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15998, a male Caucasian of age 24 with no history of mental illness <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The same procedure as experiment 15966 -1 was performed . <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr . ██████ < Begin Log > Dr . <br><br><b>███████: </b>Hello , D - 15998 , how are you feeling ?
