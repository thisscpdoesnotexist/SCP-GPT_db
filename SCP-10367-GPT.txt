The chamber is to be monitored at all times by security personnel, and any individuals attempting to use <i>SCP-10367</i> are to be detained and questioned. Individuals who have used <i>SCP-10367</i> are not considered an immediate threat; however, they may become violent if confronted about their use of the search engine .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10367</i> is a search algorithm designed to return results from the website <i>"www.google.com"</i>. <i>SCP-10367</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is used to search for any of the following terms:<br><br><i>"The Church of Google"</i><br><br><i>"Google as God"</i><br><br><i>SCP-10367</i> was discovered on 09/08/2014, after Foundation web crawlers detected a large number of internet users searching for these terms. A total of 18,867 unique IP addresses have been linked to <i>SCP-10367</i> use since its discovery, with over half located in the United States and Canada. The majority of searches originated from major metropolitan areas; however, searches were also detected in rural areas where access to computers and internet connections are limited or non-existent. Mobile devices were also used by some individuals conducting searches related to <i>SCP-10367</i>; however, this was more common among individuals living in rural areas than those living in cities . This suggests that these individuals may be using public access terminals provided by their local library or government office buildings . A full list of IP addresses linked with <i>SCP-10367</i> use can be found below:<br><br><h3>Addendum 10367.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████████, a resident of ███████, Canada who used <i>SCP-10367</i> to search for <i>"Google as God"</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent Kain </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted on 09/08/2014. The subject was detained after using <i>SCP-10367</i> to search for <i>"Google as God"</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>Kain: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████. My name is Agent Kain and I'm with the Foundation's Department of Internet Surveillance. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your use of the internet today. Subject stares at Agent Kain for several seconds before responding. <br><br><b>Subject: </b>What do you mean by that? I didn't do anything wrong! Agent <br><br><b>Kain: </b>That's not what we're here to discuss right now, sir . We just want to ask you some questions about your use of the internet today and any websites you visited . Subject sighs and crosses his arms in front of him. After several seconds he speaks again . <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Fine , but can we get this over with quickly? I have better things to do than sit around talking about my internet history all day . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The subject refused further questioning after this interview, stating that he had no more time or interest in cooperating with Foundation personnel . He was given Class A amnestics shortly afterwards and released from custody without incident .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10367.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10367-1:<br><br><b>Researcher: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br>Subject(s): D-10367, a 28 year old male of Hispanic descent from ████████, Texas. Subject has used <i>SCP-10367</i> on multiple occasions. Prior to Foundation intervention, subject was arrested for drug possession and assault after assaulting a police officer who attempted to search his home for illegal substances. Subject's wife and two children were relocated by the Foundation following his arrest; however, subject himself was kept in custody due to his violent behavior towards Foundation personnel attempting to question him about <i>SCP-10367</i> use .<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, D-10367! How are you feeling today?<br><br><b>D-10367: </b>I'm fine… I guess… What is this place? Where am I?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>You're in Site 17's Containment Wing B - or at least that's what it says on the door outside your cell! You've been here for three days now - we just want to ask you some questions about your use of Google! Is that alright with you?<br><br>D-10367 pauses briefly before responding .<br><br><b>D-10367: </b>Yeah… sure… go ahead .<br><br>Dr. ██████ pulls out a laptop computer and turns it on before placing it on the table between himself and D - 10367 . He then opens up Google Chrome and types <i>"www dot google dot com"</i> into its address bar before pressing enter . The page loads normally , displaying the Google website as expected; however , no search results are displayed when Dr. ██████ attempts to search for <i>"The Church of Google"</i>. Instead , he is presented with an error message stating <i>"No results found."</i> Dr.: Good morning, D-. How are you feeling today?: I'm fine…… What is this place? Where am I?: You're in Site 17's Containment Wing B - or at least that's what it says on the door outside your cell!

Computer Maniacal Laughter plays from speakers within computer tower <Computer Maniacal Laughter stops> Computer Maniacal Laughter plays again <Computer Maniacal Laughter stops> [DATA EXPUNGED] End Log > Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>This test confirms previous suspicions regarding SCP – 10369 ' s anomalous properties ; however , further testing must be done regarding whether or not these properties extend beyond simply searching for specific keywords relating directly or indirectly towards itself through its own website interface (i e wwwdotgooglecom). If they do indeed extend beyond this scope then containment procedures may need revision depending upon how widespread these effects become across all major internet browsers such as Firefox Chrome Safari etcetera etcetera etcetera etcetera et cetra et cetra et cetra et cetra et cetra et cetra</div>
