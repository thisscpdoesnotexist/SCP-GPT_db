Upon exposure, <i>SCP-18526</i> will immediately begin producing and broadcasting content related to said media or communication technology at an exponential rate.<br><br>This content includes videos, articles, audio recordings and other forms of digital media that are often highly entertaining and engaging for the viewers/listeners. Despite its production speed being incredibly fast compared to normal human standards (estimated at over 1 million pieces of content per hour), the quality of <i>SCP-18526</i>'s output remains consistently high.<br><br>Furthermore, <i>SCP-18526</i> has demonstrated the ability to produce new material that is tailored specifically towards each individual viewer/listener based on their personal interests and preferences. This results in a large number of people becoming addicted to consuming whatever content <i>SCP-18526</i> produces regardless of its original source material or genre.<br><br>Due to this effect, it is believed that if left unchecked <i>SCP-18526</i> could potentially cause a massive disruption within global communications networks by monopolizing all available bandwidth with its own output. As such containment protocols have been put into place in order to prevent this from occurring<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18526</i> is to be contained within a secure facility at all times. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear and maintain a minimum distance of 10 meters from <i>SCP-18526</i> at all times.<br><br>All forms of media and communication technology are strictly prohibited within the containment chamber, with any such items found being confiscated immediately. In addition, no personnel are allowed to interact with <i>SCP-18526</i> in any way other than observation or maintenance purposes.<br><br>Any attempts by personnel to access or utilize <i>SCP-18526</i>'s output for personal gain will result in immediate termination of employment and possible criminal charges depending on the severity of the offense.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18526.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18526</i> began broadcasting a series of videos in which it claimed to be the <i>"creator"</i> of all media and communication technology. These claims have yet to be verified, however due to its anomalous properties it is believed that <i>SCP-18526</i> may possess some form of deity-like status within certain circles.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18526.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18526</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-18526</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████, Head of Containment for <i>SCP-18526</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me about yourself? What is your name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18526</i>:</b> My name is Ray William Johnson. I'm a content creator and entertainer from the United States. <br><b><br> Dr. ██████:</b> How did you come to possess these anomalous abilities?<br><b><br> <i>SCP-18526</i>:</b> I don't know how it happened, but one day I suddenly found myself able to produce an endless stream of content that was tailored specifically for each individual viewer or listener. It's like my mind just works faster than normal and I'm able to produce whatever people want to see or hear. <br><b><br> Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any control over the content that you produce?<br><b><br> <i>SCP-18526</i>:</b> Not really, no. It's like my mind is just constantly producing new ideas and material without me even having to think about it. It's almost like a reflex at this point. <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 18526.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18526</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> A test was conducted to measure the rate of content production by <i>SCP-18526</i>. The subject was exposed to a variety of different media sources, including television shows, movies, music and other forms of digital media. The results were recorded and analyzed for accuracy.<br><b><br>Results:</b> It was found that <i>SCP-18526</i> is capable of producing an estimated 1 million pieces of content per hour with no signs of slowing down or decreasing quality. Furthermore, it appears that the material produced is tailored specifically towards each individual viewer/listener based on their interests and preferences.</div>
