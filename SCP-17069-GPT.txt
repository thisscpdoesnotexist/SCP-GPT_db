<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-17069</i> is  a secret frog…</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17069</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Thaumiel<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17069</i> is to be kept in a standard terrarium at Site-██. The terrarium should be equipped with a water filtration system, heating lamps and other necessary items for the frog's health and comfort.<br><br>The area surrounding <i>SCP-17069</i>'s containment chamber must be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel to ensure that no unauthorized persons enter the area. Any anomalies detected within range of <i>SCP-17069</i> must be reported immediately to the onsite supervisor.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential misuse of its anomalous properties, <i>SCP-17069</i> is not allowed to leave its containment chamber without prior approval from O5 Command.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17069</i> is a species of frog native to the Amazon rainforest, designated as Pelophylax luteiventris. It is approximately 5 cm in length and has bright yellow markings on its back.<br><br>The primary anomalous property of <i>SCP-17069</i> is that it possesses an innate ability to detect and neutralize any form of anomaly within its vicinity. This includes both physical anomalies (such as those found in other SCPs) and metaphysical anomalies (such as those caused by supernatural entities). When exposed to such an anomaly, <i>SCP-17069</i> will emit a low frequency sound wave which disrupts the anomaly's effect on reality, rendering it inert or harmless.<br><br>In addition to this, <i>SCP-17069</i> also emits a powerful pheromone which induces feelings of calmness and relaxation in any human subject within range. This effect can be used to help contain hostile or dangerous SCPs with minimal effort required from Foundation personnel.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17069.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17069</i> was relocated to Site-██ following a containment breach caused by an unknown anomaly. During the incident, <i>SCP-17069</i> was able to neutralize the anomaly and prevent any further damage. As such, it has been classified as Thaumiel and is now being used to help contain other SCPs more effectively.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17069.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation operative interviewed <i>SCP-17069</i> in order to gain a better understanding of its anomalous properties. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><br><b>Operative: </b>Can you tell us how you are able to neutralize anomalies?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17069</i>: </b>It's something I was born with. Whenever I sense an anomaly, I emit a low frequency sound wave which disrupts its effect on reality.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17069.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to evaluate the effects of <i>SCP-17069</i>'s pheromone on human subjects. The test involved exposing five (5) D-Class personnel to an unknown anomaly and then introducing <i>SCP-17069</i> into the area. All five (5) subjects reported feeling calmer and more relaxed after <i>SCP-17069</i> was introduced, with four (4) of them reporting that they felt no fear or anxiety in its presence.</div>
