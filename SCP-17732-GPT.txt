If held for longer than ten minutes, their body temperature begins to drop rapidly and eventually death may occur due to hypothermia if not treated immediately.<br><br>It should be noted that these effects do not apply if <i>SCP-17732</i> is simply touched or handled without being held by anyone; however, it does still cause visions even when touched briefly by someone who has already experienced them before.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17732</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times.
