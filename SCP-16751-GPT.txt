Testing with <i>SCP-16751</i> is currently suspended.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16751</i> is a ballpoint pen of unknown make and model. When <i>SCP-16751</i> is touched by a human being, the subject will immediately become blind. The blindness will persist until the subject dies or <i>SCP-16751</i> is removed from their possession.<br><br><i>SCP-16751</i> was discovered on ██/██/████ in [REDACTED], India, after several reports of people becoming blind were reported to local authorities. Foundation agents embedded in local law enforcement units intercepted the reports and managed to retrieve <i>SCP-16751</i> before any civilian casualties occurred. All witnesses were administered Class A amnestics and false memories implanted before being released back into society with new identities provided by MTF Psi-7 (<i>"Pseudo Memories"</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16751.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████████, a local resident who was blinded by <i>SCP-16751</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>████████, a local resident who claims to have been blinded by <i>SCP-16751</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted to determine the cause of blindness in subjects affected by <i>SCP-16751</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello Mr. ███████, I'm Doctor ████ from the Foundation and I'd like to ask you some questions about [DATA EXPUNGED]. <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>Yeah, sure Doc… What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Well first off, how did this happen? Did you get into an accident or something? <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>No no no… It was nothing like that… It was just one day when I woke up and my eyes were all blurry and shit… So I went down to the doctor's office but he couldn't figure out what it was either so he sent me on my way with some painkillers and told me not to worry about it too much… But then they got worse over time so eventually I had to stop working at the factory because everything looked all blurry whenever I tried doing anything there… And now here we are today! [laughs] <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Thank you for your time sir, is there anything else that you can tell us about what happened? Anything at all that might be useful in our investigation into this pen? <br><br><b>Mr. █████.: </b>Oh yeah! There's one thing I remember now because it was so weird; after touching that pen everything got really dark for a few seconds before going back normal again! And then later when my eyes started getting bad they stayed dark even though they were supposed to be getting better! That's why nobody could figure out what happened; they thought maybe someone put something inside them or something but it turns out it wasn't anyone else at all! It was just this stupid pen!
