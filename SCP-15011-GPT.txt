Testing is to be done in a computer lab with no other computers connected to the network.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15011</i> is a computer program which when run on any Windows operating system will cause the user's computer to crash after twenty minutes of use. The program also appears to be able to infect other computers connected to the same network as <i>SCP-15011</i>, causing them to crash after twenty minutes of use as well.<br><br><i>SCP-15011</i> has been discovered in graveyards across the United States and Canada, often placed in coffins or at grave sites. Instances of <i>SCP-15011</i> are usually found with a note attached which reads <i>"Please enjoy this gift from our family."</i> There have been no reports of instances being found outside North America.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15011.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>█████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ███████████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ███████████: </b>Hello Mr. ██████, I'm Dr. ███████████ and I'll be conducting the interview today. Can you tell me what happened?<br><br><b>██████: </b>Sure thing doc, it was just like any other day at work for me, sitting in my office working on some code when all of a sudden my computer starts making this awful noise and then it just crashes! It was terrible! I had to go out and buy a new one right away!<br><br><b>Dr. ███████████: </b>And did you see anything unusual before your computer crashed?<br><br><b>██████: </b>No not really… wait a minute now that I think about it there was this weird old man who came into the office earlier that day asking for someone named <i>"Pete"</i>. He said he wanted to do an interview with him or something but when he found out Pete wasn't in he got really mad and asked if anyone knew where he lived or how to contact him so he could give him something important… but no one did so we told him we didn't know where Pete lived or how to get in touch with him so then he started getting madder saying stuff like <i>"I'll find you"</i> and <i>"You'd better watch your back"</i>. Then after that he just left without saying anything else… Wait now that I think about it maybe the guy left his number on my desk since no one knew who Pete was or where they could find him… yeah here's his number right here [shows interviewer phone number]. You should call this guy up doc because maybe whatever happened to my computer is related to whatever gave this guy such a grudge against Pete! He seemed pretty pissed off about something!<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15011.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15011-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15011, a Level 2 researcher.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15011 was instructed to run <i>SCP-15011</i> on a computer in the lab. The computer was connected to the network and had no other computers attached to it. After twenty minutes of use, the computer crashed as expected. This test was repeated three times with similar results every time.<br><br>Experiment 15011-2:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15012, a Level 3 researcher and former Foundation programmer who has experience with ██████ OS (a operating system very similar to Windows).<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As in Experiment 15011-1 except that [DATA EXPUNGED]. After twenty minutes of use, the computer crashed as expected. This test was repeated three times with similar results every time.<br><br>Experiment 15011-3:</div>
