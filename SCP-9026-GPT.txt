It is to be fed once daily, and if it refuses food it is to be force-fed. If été does not eat for two days or more, an on-site medical doctor should be notified immediately.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> été is an anomalous creature of unknown origin, with a length of 8.2 meters and a weight of approximately 40 kg. It resembles something akin to a cross between a human child and an octopus, with four octopus-like arms, two plump legs ending in what appear to be fins instead of feet, and no head. Its entire body is covered in red fur (though it should be noted that the fur covers the entirety of its body except for its eyes), which grows longer as time passes; as such, no clear indication exists as to how old été might actually be.<br><br>It speaks fluent french — albeit with an odd accent — and can understand english perfectly (alongside other languages). Despite this ability to speak other languages fluently, it prefers not to use them; whenever possible it will answer questions or make statements exclusively in french . While speaking english , however , été's voice seems heavily distorted; those who hear it claim that their ears feel like they are bleeding inside . It has been noted that for unknown reasons 90% of those exposed to <i>SCP-9026</i>'s voice begin vomiting profusely after hearing three consecutive words from <i>SCP-9026</i>'s speech. The vomit produced by these individuals always contains small pieces of various cheeses — including brie , camembert , gorgonzola , roquefort and emmental — though experimentation has proven that the cheese found within said vomit does not originate from any known species or breed . The source(s) behind this occurrence is currently being studied by Foundation scientists under Drs. ██████ & ██████████.<br><br><i>SCP-9026</i> was discovered on 19/04/1990 when several residents living near Lake Geneva reported seeing <i>"a child without a head running along the surface"</i> [sic]<br> around 04:00 AM local time .

Mobile Task Force Epsilon 12 (<i>"Custodians"</i>) was formed in 19██ after reports of <i>"a child with no head"</i> began reaching Foundation agents stationed in Europe; their purpose is to locate and contain any such anomalies reported, with non-lethal force if possible. Upon encountering <i>SCP-9026</i>, the leader of the group — Agent ██████████ — approached it rapidly from behind before placing a hand firmly over its mouth. It is unknown how <i>SCP-9026</i> managed to free itself from Agent ██████████'s grasp , but once freed it began shouting what several members described as <i>"angry insults"</i> [sic] at them .

Several team leaders have now given orders for their teams' respective movements into position, though été appears unfazed by any of this due its being inside water right now .<br><br>18:36 PM — Order given for all teams except Team 1 and 2 (who are currently assigned as snipers) start moving into position surrounding été with one team member per square meter; if no resistance is met then they are ordered start moving forward until they surround the creature completely , while Teams 3 through 5 move directly underneath été's location with scuba gear equipped awaiting orders . The remaining two teams remain stationed on land due their lack of skill in aquatic environments or scuba diving equipment respectively ; these teams will be used once we know exactly where été is heading since that would be our best chance of stopping whatever plan it might have. Once all necessary positions are taken up , an order is given instructing each team leader present send two men underwater via oxygen tanks and masks so that we could determine whether or not we can catch up with été using aquatic vehicles .
