When activated, it will summon an entity referred to as the “Abdominals IV”. The Abdominals IV is an entity composed of several muscular humanoid figures, each standing approximately 2 meters tall and weighing around 150 kilograms. All figures are male and have no visible facial features except for their eyes, which are black and appear to be made of obsidian.<br><br>The Abdominals IV possess superhuman strength and agility, capable of easily lifting objects several times their own weight without strain or effort. They also possess powerful regenerative abilities that allow them to heal wounds almost instantaneously. In addition, they possess the ability to manipulate energy in order to create force fields around themselves or other targets, allowing them limited protection from physical harm or magical attacks.<br><br>When summoned via <i>SCP-21130</i>’s ritual, the Abdominals IV will obey any commands given by the caster unless specifically instructed otherwise; however they will not attack anyone unless provoked first or ordered directly by their summoner. If left unchecked for too long however they may become increasingly hostile towards those who oppose them until eventually attacking on sight regardless of orders given previously by their summoner if not restrained in some way beforehand.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21130</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times and only accessed with Level 4 clearance or higher. Any personnel attempting to activate the ritual inscribed on <i>SCP-21130</i> must first obtain permission from the Site Director before proceeding.<br><br>In the event that an Abdominals IV is summoned, it must be contained immediately using whatever means necessary. If possible, it should be restrained and transported back to its containment locker for further study. If this is not possible then any other suitable containment measures must be taken until such time as the entity can be safely returned to its original location.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21130.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-21130</i> was discovered in the possession of a cult attempting to summon an Abdominals IV for use as a guardian. The cult members were detained and taken into custody while <i>SCP-21130</i> was confiscated and brought to Site-██ for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21130.2: </h3> Interview with Abdominals IV<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of researchers attempted to interview the Abdominals IV summoned by <i>SCP-21130</i>. The following is an excerpt from the transcript of that interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> “What is your purpose?” <br><b>Abdominals IV:</b> “We are here to serve our master and protect him from any who would oppose him. We will do whatever he commands us to do without hesitation or question.”<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> “What is your origin?” <br><b>Abdominals IV:</b> “We were created by a powerful mage who wished to have loyal servants at his command. We are the result of his ritual and we will obey him until our existence ends.”<br><br><h3> Addendum 21130.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21130.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to test the Abdominals IV’s combat capabilities. For this purpose, a team of three (3) D-Class personnel were tasked with engaging the entity in combat while being monitored by security cameras and researchers. The results of the experiment are as follows:<br><br>• The Abdominals IV was able to easily overpower all three (3) D-Class personnel within minutes, despite their combined efforts; no casualties were reported however due to its regenerative abilities. <br>• During the fight, it employed several energy-based attacks that proved effective against both physical and magical assaults from its opponents. <br>• After successfully subduing all combatants, it returned to its containment locker without further incident or provocation from any personnel present at the time.</div>
