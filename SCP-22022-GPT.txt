It appears to be a standard locomotive and passenger carriages, but with several anomalous features. The locomotive appears to be powered by an unknown energy source, and is capable of travelling at speeds far beyond those attainable by conventional means.<br><br>The interior of the train contains numerous rooms filled with various artifacts from different cultures. These artifacts appear to have been collected over centuries and stored for safekeeping in this location. In addition, each carriage contains a single entity that appears to act as both conductor and guardian of the train's passengers.<br><br>When passengers board <i>SCP-22022</i> they are transported into an alternate plane of existence referred to as <i>"the Afterlife"</i>. Here they can interact with other entities from various points throughout history who have also boarded the train. Passengers can stay on board for as long or short a time as desired before returning back through <i>SCP-22022</i>'s doors into their original reality without any physical changes or memories of their journey having taken place. <br><br><i>SCP-22022</i> has been observed entering our world at random intervals since its discovery in ████ AD, though it has yet to make contact with anyone outside its own realm during these visits.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-22022</i> is to be monitored at all times by personnel stationed at Site-██. Any sightings of the train are to be reported immediately and a full investigation launched.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-22022</i> appears in our world, all personnel are to remain at least 500 meters away from it and refrain from attempting contact with any entities on board. If contact is made, personnel are instructed to observe and document the interaction without interfering.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22022.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a small group of Foundation personnel were able to board <i>SCP-22022</i> and explore its interior. During this exploration, they encountered a number of entities including [DATA EXPUNGED]. After several hours of interaction with these entities, the personnel returned to our reality without any physical changes or memories of their journey having taken place.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22022.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-22022</i>'s Conductor<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of personnel were able to make contact with the entity acting as conductor aboard <i>SCP-22022</i>. The following is an excerpt from the interview: <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Where does this train go?"</i> <br><b><br>Conductor:</b> <i>"It goes wherever it needs to go. It takes passengers on a journey through time and space, to places they have never seen before."</i> <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"What kind of passengers do you take?"</i> <br><b><br>Conductor:</b> <i>"All kinds. Those who are searching for answers, those who seek knowledge or understanding, and those who simply wish to explore what lies beyond their current reality."</i> <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"And how do your passengers return?"</i> <br><b><br>Conductor:</b> <i>"When they are ready, the train will take them back to where they came from, with all the knowledge and understanding they have acquired during their journey."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 22022.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a research team was dispatched to investigate <i>SCP-22022</i> and attempt contact with its passengers. The team entered the train and were able to interact with several entities from various points throughout history. After approximately two hours of observation, the team returned without incident. <br><br>The following is a summary of their observations: <br>• Several passengers indicated that they had been travelling on board <i>SCP-22022</i> for centuries, though none could provide an exact timeline or destination for their journey. <br>• Passengers reported feeling contentment and peace while on board the train, despite not knowing when or where it would arrive at its final destination. <br>• All passengers expressed gratitude towards the conductor for providing them with a safe haven during their travels.</div>
