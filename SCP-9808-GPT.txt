After that happened i fell down towards the ground fast until finally hitting the ground hard making all my bones break into pieces leaving only half from what used to be there before ,and after all this happened while laying on the cold floor unable to move ,i felt something coming near towards myself as if someone was walking towards myself slowly until finally reaching myself as if someone grabbed hold of my body dragging itself across the floor until finally stopping right next to myself as if someone lifted itself off from where ever their legs were standing onto itself still holding onto myself tightly refusing not let go off its grip on itself making sure not letting anything happen with itself or else something bad would happen ,but suddenly everything became dark around us both while still being ableto hear each others breathing getting faster every second feeling like we both were running out of air soon enough . After a few minutes later everything became bright again revealing ourselves being covered in light revealing ourselves having turned into these weird creatures known as <i>"SCP's"</i> explaining why we are now like this now instead of being normal humans turning into these weird creatures known as <i>"SCP's"</i>. Then suddenly everything went back normal again just like nothing even happened between us two . And ever since then we've been living together through thick and thin… well mostly thin considering how skinny you are… anyways… yeah.. thats pretty much how things went down.. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It seems that 9808 is telling us exactly what happened right? Well yes! But wait! Something is wrong here! What?! It seems that 9408 lied during its interview because accordingto documents found in [DATA EXPUNGED] saying that [DATA EXPUNGED] never existed !
