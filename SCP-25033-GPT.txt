She has no distinguishing features, and appears to be in good health.<br><br><i>SCP-25033</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when she suffers physical injury or illness. When this occurs, any lost or damaged tissue will regenerate at an accelerated rate over the course of several hours. This process does not require conscious effort from <i>SCP-25033</i>; it simply happens automatically when her body is damaged or ill.<br><br>It should be noted that while <i>SCP-25033</i> can regenerate any organ or tissue (except for a full brain), she cannot regenerate lost limbs or appendages without assistance from medical personnel. Additionally, regeneration of organs and tissues does not increase her overall lifespan; it merely repairs damage caused by injury or illness.<br><br>Furthermore, if <i>SCP-25033</i> were to suffer severe trauma resulting in death, she would remain dead as the regenerative properties do not extend to reviving the deceased subject from death itself.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-25033</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. She is to be provided with three meals per day, and should have access to recreational activities as approved by her assigned personnel.<br><br>In the event of injury or illness, medical personnel are to be notified immediately so that they can provide appropriate treatment and monitor the regeneration process.<br><br>Any requests for testing must first be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 personnel before being carried out.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25033.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-25033</i> was injured in a containment breach. Medical personnel were able to successfully treat her injuries and monitor the regeneration process.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25033.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-25033</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-25033</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████, Site-██ Head Researcher<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview was conducted to determine the origin of <i>SCP-25033</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-25033</i>, can you tell me how you developed your anomalous properties? <br><b><br><i>SCP-25033</i>:</b> I'm not sure. It just seemed to happen one day, out of the blue. I noticed that when I got injured or sick, my body would heal itself much faster than it used to.  At first I thought it was just a fluke, but then it kept happening and eventually I realized what was going on. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any idea why this happened? <br><b><br> <i>SCP-25033</i>:</b> No, none at all. It's like something just switched on inside of me and now this is how my body works. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I see. Do you have any other abilities that you are aware of? <br><b><br><i>SCP-25033</i>:</b> No, nothing else that I can think of. Just this one ability to regenerate quickly and efficiently. <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> Interview concluded. <i>SCP-25033</i> showed no signs of deception throughout the interview.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25033.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 25033.3-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-25033</i> was administered a lethal dose of poison in an attempt to observe the regenerative process. The subject expired within minutes of ingestion, and her body did not regenerate as expected. It is presumed that this property does not extend to reviving the deceased subject from death itself.</div>
