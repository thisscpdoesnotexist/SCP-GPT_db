When <i>SCP-18175</i> is applied to any surface, an anomalous human hand will sprout from the surface within 10 minutes of application. The hands have no apparent connection to any living organism and are composed of flesh and bone similar to that of normal human hands.<br><br>The hands produced by <i>SCP-18175</i> are capable of performing basic motor functions such as grasping objects, but lack sensation or feeling. Upon removal from the surface they were created on, the hands will disintegrate into dust after 5 minutes.<br><br>Upon further study it has been discovered that when <i>SCP-18175</i> is applied to living organisms, it causes severe tissue damage and death due to extreme cellular growth in the area where the cream was applied. It should be noted that this effect does not occur when applying <i>SCP-18175</i> directly onto nonliving surfaces such as walls or floors.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18175</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-18175</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Testing of <i>SCP-18175</i> must be approved by the Site Director and conducted under strict supervision.<br><br>Any hands created by <i>SCP-18175</i> are to be contained in individual containment cells until they disintegrate into dust. Any personnel exposed to <i>SCP-18175</i> must undergo a full medical examination before returning to duty.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18175.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18175</i> was found in the possession of an unidentified individual. The individual was apprehended and questioned, but no useful information was obtained.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18175.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> What can you tell me about <i>SCP-18175</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> <i>SCP-18175</i> is a hand cream that causes anomalous hands to sprout from whatever surface it's used on. The hands lack sensation and feeling, and will disintegrate into dust after 5 minutes of removal from the surface they were created on. When applied to living organisms it causes severe tissue damage and death due to extreme cellular growth in the area where the cream was applied.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18175.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> <i>SCP-18175</i> was applied to a wall in an empty room. After 10 minutes, a hand sprouted from the wall and began to move around the room. The hand eventually stopped moving after 5 minutes and disintegrated into dust.<br><b><br>Experiment 2:</b> <i>SCP-18175</i> was applied directly onto the arm of D-93745. Within seconds, D-93745 began to scream in pain as their arm rapidly expanded with new tissue growth before exploding due to excessive pressure from within.</div>
