Its body is covered in thick, armor-like plates of chitin that appear to be impervious to most forms of damage. It stands approximately 4 meters tall and weighs roughly 2,000 kilograms.<br><br><i>SCP-17648</i> displays sapience, though its intelligence level appears to be limited. It has demonstrated the ability to understand basic commands given in English and respond accordingly. <i>SCP-17648</i> also possesses some degree of problem solving skills as well as an understanding of cause and effect relationships.<br><br>The primary anomalous property displayed by <i>SCP-17648</i> is its extreme durability; it has proven resistant to most forms of physical damage including bullets, blades, explosives, acids and energy weapons such as lasers or plasma cannons. Additionally, it can regenerate lost limbs or organs at an accelerated rate if provided with enough nutrition; this process usually takes less than 24 hours for minor wounds but may take up to several days for more severe injuries such as missing limbs or organs.<br><br><i>SCP-17648</i>'s diet consists mainly of organic matter such as plants or animals (though it will occasionally consume nonorganic materials if necessary). It does not appear capable of digesting inorganic substances such as metal or plastic however these items are often found partially digested within its stomach during autopsy examinations indicating that the creature may have some form of limited digestive capability when exposed to certain substances over extended periods of time .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17648</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with reinforced walls and ceiling capable of withstanding up to 5 tons of force. A minimum of two armed guards are to be stationed outside the containment cell at all times, and any personnel entering the chamber must wear Level 4 protective gear.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-17648</i> from escaping its containment, it is to be provided with a steady supply of food and water as well as regular mental stimulation in the form of puzzles or other activities designed specifically for it. Any attempts by <i>SCP-17648</i> to breach its containment must be met with lethal force if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17648.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17648</i> breached containment and escaped Site-██. After a lengthy search, it was located and re-contained by MTF Epsilon-6 (<i>"Village Idiots"</i>) approximately ██ kilometers from the facility. Following its recapture, additional security measures have been implemented to prevent further escapes.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17648.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17648</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-17648</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17648</i>.
