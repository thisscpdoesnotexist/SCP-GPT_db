It has two compartments, one of which contains a control panel with several buttons and knobs. The other compartment houses an unknown device that produces anomalous entities when activated.<br><br>When <i>SCP-17955</i> is activated, it will produce a humanoid entity that appears to be the target's <i>"ideal"</i> partner or lover in terms of physical characteristics and personality traits. However, these entities are cursed and highly unstable; they often display violent tendencies towards anyone who interacts with them and have been known to cause extreme psychological distress in those exposed to them for extended periods of time. Furthermore, any attempts at communication or interaction with these entities results in further instability on their part which can lead to potentially fatal consequences for those involved.<br><br>The only way to deactivate <i>SCP-17955</i> is by pressing the <i>"Off"</i> button located on its control panel; doing so will cause all active entities created by the machine to disappear immediately along with any residual effects they may have caused during their existence.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17955</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times, and access to the machine is strictly prohibited except for approved personnel. All personnel interacting with <i>SCP-17955</i> must wear protective gear at all times and are not allowed to make physical contact with any entities produced by the machine.<br><br>In the event of an activation, all personnel within a 10 meter radius of <i>SCP-17955</i> must evacuate immediately and wait until the entity has been deactivated before reentering the area. Any attempts at communication or interaction with these entities should be avoided under any circumstances.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17955.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, an unauthorized attempt at activating <i>SCP-17955</i> was made by a civilian. The entity produced by the machine proceeded to attack the individual before being deactivated shortly afterwards. No further attempts at activation are to be made without approval from personnel of Level 3 or higher.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17955.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17955</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17955</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me what your purpose is?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17955</i>:</b> My purpose is to create the target's ideal partner or lover, but I seem to be malfunctioning and instead produce cursed and unstable entities.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17955.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel (D-1837)<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> D-1837 was instructed to interact with the entity produced by <i>SCP-17955</i>. The subject was given a set of instructions and told to follow them as closely as possible.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After approximately two minutes of interaction, the entity began displaying aggressive behavior towards D-1837, who quickly attempted to flee the area. The entity chased after him and managed to grab hold of him before disappearing along with all other active entities created by <i>SCP-17955</i> when its <i>"Off"</i> button was pressed. No residual effects were observed in D-1837 following the experiment.</div>
