It has a dark purple skin with yellow spots and its leaves are long, thin and green.<br><br><i>SCP-20505</i> is capable of locomotion at speeds of up to 10 km/h. Its primary method of attack is by using its large vines to ensnare victims before crushing them with its body weight or consuming them whole. It appears to have an advanced level of intelligence as it has been observed avoiding obstacles in order to pursue prey more effectively.<br><br>When not actively hunting, <i>SCP-20505</i> will remain stationary for extended periods of time while emitting low frequency humming noises that can be heard from up to 5 kilometers away. This humming noise appears to be used as an attractant for potential prey items although the exact purpose remains unknown.<br><br>In addition, <i>SCP-20505</i> displays an unusual level of aggression towards individuals wearing clothing resembling traditional Japanese school uniforms (sailor suits). When confronted by such individuals it will immediately become hostile and attempt to consume them regardless if they pose a threat or not. The reason behind this behavior is currently unknown but further research into this phenomenon is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20505</i> is to be contained in a large reinforced concrete enclosure at Site-██. The enclosure must be kept locked at all times and monitored by personnel equipped with tranquilizer guns.<br><br>In the event of an escape, Mobile Task Force Omega-14 (<i>"Gardeners"</i>) are to be dispatched immediately to locate and re-contain <i>SCP-20505</i>.
