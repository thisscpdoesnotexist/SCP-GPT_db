<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24780 is  an antimeme that cannot be perceived</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24780<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24780</i> is an antimeme, a concept that cannot be perceived by any form of communication or media. It is impossible to describe, explain, or otherwise communicate the nature of <i>SCP-24780</i> in any way. Attempts to do so will result in complete failure and confusion on the part of the subject attempting to convey it.<br><br>Attempts at learning more about <i>SCP-24780</i> have been met with similar results; no matter how much information is gathered about it, all attempts at understanding its nature fail. It has been theorized that this phenomenon may be related to quantum entanglement or other phenomena beyond our current level of understanding.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-24780</i>, containment is not possible. All attempts to contain it have been met with failure. Research into the phenomenon is ongoing, but no progress has been made in understanding its nature or purpose.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24780.1: </h3><br><br>Following the initial discovery of <i>SCP-24780</i>, a research team was assembled to investigate its nature. The team consisted of six researchers with expertise in various fields such as psychology, linguistics, and physics. After two weeks of intense study and experimentation, the team concluded that it was impossible to understand or describe <i>SCP-24780</i> in any meaningful way. All attempts at doing so resulted in confusion and frustration on the part of the subject attempting to convey it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24780.2: </h3> Interview with Researcher ████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> Researcher ████, assigned to <i>SCP-24780</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> How long have you been assigned to <i>SCP-24780</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> About three months now. It's a strange thing, I can't really explain it but…I feel like I'm getting closer to understanding it. Like there's something just beyond my reach that I can almost grasp if I try hard enough. But every time I think I'm close, it slips away again and all the progress is lost.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you think we'll ever be able to understand what this thing is?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> I don't know. It's impossible to say. But I'm determined to keep trying until we can find some way of understanding it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24780.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 24780-1:</b> A subject was asked to describe <i>SCP-24780</i> in as much detail as possible. The subject reported feeling confused and unable to articulate what they were trying to convey, eventually giving up after a few minutes.<br><b><br>Experiment 24780-2:</b> A group of subjects were exposed to an image of <i>SCP-24780</i>. All subjects reported being unable to comprehend the image, describing it as <i>"strange"</i> or <i>"unsettling"</i>. No further information could be obtained from the experiment.</div>
