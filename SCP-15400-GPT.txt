As per standard protocol , both guards were replaced by D - class personnel for further observation . Upon entering the cell , both D - class personnel were killed due to injuries sustained from an unknown source within the room . A third guard was sent into investigate but suffered similar injuries as those sustained by previous personnel before dying on site one hour later .
