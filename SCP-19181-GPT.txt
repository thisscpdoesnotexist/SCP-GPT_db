This transformation occurs without warning and without any external stimuli or cause.<br><br>The catgirl form possessed by President Biden bears no resemblance to any known species of cat and possesses several unique features, including:<br><br>• A pair of long ears that are slightly pointed at the tips. <br>• An elongated muzzle with pronounced whiskers. <br>• A thick coat of fur that varies in color from white to black depending on lighting conditions. <br>• Six retractable claws on each hand and foot capable of slicing through most materials with ease. <br>• Enhanced agility and strength beyond what would be expected for a human being his age (78). <br>• The ability to communicate telepathically with other felines within a radius of approximately 500 meters. <br><br> Despite these changes, President Biden retains all memories and mental faculties he had prior to transformation as well as his full political power as president; however, he has been observed exhibiting more aggressive behavior than usual when interacting with members of his staff or foreign dignitaries due to his newfound abilities. Additionally, attempts by personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> containment have met with failure; it appears that President Biden cannot be restrained or contained using conventional means due to the nature of his transformation.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-19181</i>, containment is not possible at this time. However, personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> are to monitor President Biden's activities and report any unusual behavior or changes in his physical form. In the event that President Biden's transformation becomes permanent, a specialized containment unit will be constructed for him. <br><br>In addition, all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> are required to undergo psychological evaluation every two weeks in order to ensure they remain mentally stable and capable of performing their duties without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19181.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, President Biden was observed in his catgirl form for the first time. Upon transformation, he immediately began to exhibit signs of distress and confusion before fleeing the White House grounds. He was eventually located by personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> containment and returned to the White House without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19181.2: </h3> Interview with President Biden<br><br>On 03/17/2021, personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> containment conducted an interview with President Biden in order to gain further insight into the nature of his transformation. The following is a transcript of the interview: <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Good afternoon, Mr. President. Can you tell us what happened when you were first transformed? <br><b><br>President Biden:</b> It was very sudden and unexpected; one moment I was talking to my staff about our upcoming plans for the day and then suddenly I felt a strange sensation all over my body and before I knew it, I had become… this creature that you see before you now. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know who or what caused your transformation?<br><b><br>President Biden:</b> No, I do not. As far as I can tell, it was some kind of magical force that caused my transformation. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know why you were chosen for this transformation?<br><b><br>President Biden:</b> No, I do not. It's a mystery to me why this happened to me and not someone else; all I can say is that it must have been fate or destiny at work here. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any advice for anyone who might find themselves in a similar situation?<br><b><br>President Biden:</b> Yes. First and foremost, don't panic. It's important to remain calm and collected during such an unexpected event, as it can help you keep your wits about you and make the best of the situation. Secondly, remember that while this transformation may be strange or frightening at first, it doesn't mean that it has to define who you are; with patience and perseverance, you can still live a fulfilling life regardless of what form you take.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19181.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 19181-A:</b> On ██/██/20██, personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19181</i> containment attempted to restrain President Biden using a specialized containment suit. Upon contact with the suit, President Biden's form shifted back into its human state and he was successfully contained. However, within several minutes of being restrained, President Biden began exhibiting signs of distress and his transformation resumed shortly thereafter. <br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> It appears that attempting to contain President Biden in any way is not possible due to the nature of his transformation.</div>
