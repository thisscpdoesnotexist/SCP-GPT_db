<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21777 is  a duck that smells really bad. And I mean REALLY bad. It smells worse than you can possibly imagine. If you think you or I can describe it in words, you're wrong. Not even the greatest poets of any generation can come close to describing the malodorous stench this duck emits.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21777<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21777</i> is a duck of an unknown species, approximately 0.7m in length and weighing 2kg. It has yellow plumage with black beak and feet.<br><br>The primary anomalous property of <i>SCP-21777</i> is its incredibly foul odor, which permeates the area around it for up to 10 meters away. The smell has been described as being similar to rotting garbage or spoiled eggs, but stronger than both combined. The smell persists even after the duck has left the area, lingering for several days before dissipating completely.<br><br>Attempts to contain <i>SCP-21777</i> have been unsuccessful due to its ability to fly away quickly when approached by personnel or objects attempting containment measures such as nets or cages. As such, it is currently uncontained and monitored from a distance by Foundation personnel using drones equipped with infrared cameras and other tracking devices.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21777</i> is to be monitored from a distance using drones equipped with infrared cameras and other tracking devices. Any sightings of <i>SCP-21777</i> should be reported to the nearest Foundation facility for further investigation.<br><br>In the event that containment becomes necessary, personnel are to use nets or cages in order to capture it. Personnel must wear protective gear at all times when attempting containment due to the extreme stench emanating from <i>SCP-21777</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21777.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-21777</i> was observed to have laid an egg in a nest constructed from sticks and grass. The egg was collected by Foundation personnel and transported to Site-██ for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21777.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21777</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a brief interview was conducted with <i>SCP-21777</i>. During the interview, it demonstrated an understanding of human speech and responded to questions in English. It claimed that it had been living in the area for several years and that its odor was caused by a curse placed on it by an unknown entity. It also stated that it could not remove the curse or change its smell, but offered no further information as to who or what cursed it.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Please state your name for the record.<br><b><br><i>SCP-21777</i>:</b> My name is [REDACTED].<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know why you smell so bad?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21777</i>:</b> Yes, I do. It is because of a curse placed on me by an unknown entity. I cannot remove the curse or change my smell in any way.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21777.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-21777</i>'s odor on other living organisms. A sample of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were placed in a sealed container and exposed to the odor emanating from <i>SCP-21777</i> for 10 minutes. After the exposure period, all fruit flies had died due to asphyxiation caused by their inability to breathe in the presence of such an intense smell.</div>
