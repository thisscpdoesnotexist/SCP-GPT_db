The Foundation was alerted and questioned several individuals who claimed that they were <i>"dragged down into a hellish abyss by some sort of tentacle monster"</i>. A team was sent out immediately and found what appeared to be an opening at the center of town that lead down into an underground cave filled with stalactites, stalagmites, and pools of water. Several tracks indicated that something extremely large dragged victims into the cave from the entrance before pulling them under with its tentacles and eating them whole (or in pieces). A search for more entrances around town was conducted by teams wearing hazmat suits but none were found for several days until one team stumbled upon another opening during their search through forested areas near [DATA EXPUNGED]. Said entrance had somehow been hidden inside an old tree stump which appeared to have grown around it over time until it became fused together. All efforts to remove this entrance have failed so far but we're still trying different methods involving mechanical equipment such as jackhammers and chainsaws . The plan is not working though because we can't get anyone close enough without getting eaten alive or pulled into <i>SCP-9160</i>'s stomachs up close<br><br><i>SCP-</i>XXXX feeding on D class personnel<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-</i>XXXX was discovered when reports of <i>"a large tentacle monster that eats people"</i> surfaced.

A team was sent out immediately and found <i>SCP-</i>XXXX feeding on a D class personnel. The Foundation learned that <i>SCP-</i>XXXX had been living in the [DATA EXPUNGED] Forest for several years, preying on local wildlife and occasionally humans who were stupid enough to venture into the forest at night.<br><br><i>SCP-9180</i> is an old wooden door that leads to a ██████████ building located in ████████, Texas.<br><br><i>SCP-9180</i> is an old wooden door that leads to a significant amount of land outside our reality/universe . This area has been referred to as <i>SCP-9180</i>'s pocket dimension or universe by researchers due to it being isolated from our own space time continuum . It appears the only way one can enter this location is through the use of <i>SCP-9180</i> itself; other methods have resulted in various levels of failure, resulting in death or termination for those involved .<br><br></div>
