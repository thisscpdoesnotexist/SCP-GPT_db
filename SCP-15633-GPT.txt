What do you want to know? Dr.████████:: Well first off what is your phone's model number? Mr.: It's a [REDACTED] brand phone with unlimited battery! That thing never dies! It's great for long trips or when you're out of power and need to call someone real quick! Dr.: And how did you come across it? Mr.: I found it in an old box at my house when I was cleaning up some stuff from my garage last week…I don't really remember where it came from though…I think my dad gave it to me but he died a while ago so I can't be sure…Dr.: Do you know if anyone else has this phone? Mr.: No idea man, there were other phones in the box too but they were all broken except for mine so I guess that means no one else does have one huh? Anyway can we stop talking about this now and talk about something else instead?!
