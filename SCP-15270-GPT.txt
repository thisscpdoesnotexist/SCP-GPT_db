All personnel who have played <i>SCP-15270</i> are to undergo a mandatory psychiatric evaluation.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15270</i> is a multiplayer horror game in which players take on the role of D-Class personnel. The game features an in-game chat system, and players are able to communicate with each other using this feature.<br><br><i>SCP-15270</i> was first discovered after a series of reports were filed by Foundation agents stationed at Site ██, who had been playing the game during their off time. All subjects reported hearing strange noises during their play sessions, as well as seeing unusual messages written in blood appear on their screens. These messages included phrases such as <i>"You can't hide from us"</i> and <i>"We see you"</i>.<br><br>After the Foundation became aware of <i>SCP-15270</i>'s existence, Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (<i>"Damn Feds"</i>) was sent to investigate the source of <i>SCP-15270</i>'s anomalous activity. MTF Iota 10 operatives discovered that <i>SCP-15270</i> was being produced by [REDACTED], a small indie video game development studio based out of [REDACTED]. After gaining permission from Agent ████████ (Head Researcher at Site ██), MTF Iota 10 operatives entered [REDACTED] headquarters under the guise of conducting an investigation into possible tax evasion charges against them. During this operation, all members of [REDACTED] staff were apprehended and taken into custody without incident or casualties on either side (See Addendum 15270a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15270.1 : </h3>【ACCESS GRANTED】 Interview Log 15270-1<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>[REDACTED]<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Agent ████████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted by Agent ████████ after the apprehension of [REDACTED] staff. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Alright, let's get started.

Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions regarding <i>SCP-15270</i>, if that is alright with you? <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Sure thing man! Ask away! I've got nothing to hide from the Feds! (laughs) Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Good. Now then, how did this game come about? Why did you decide to make it in the first place? <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Well it all started back when my friend and I were chilling out at his house one night and we stumbled across some old SCP articles on the internet… We found them really interesting so we decided to make a game based on them! We wanted people who had never heard of the Foundation before to be able to experience what it was like working there without having to read through all those boring reports so we thought <i>"Hey why don't we just make a video game about it?"</i> So that's what we did!

All four subjects were chosen for their extensive knowledge of video games.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were given a copy of SCP - 15 270 and told to play it for a period of 5 hours. After this time had passed subjects were ordered to take part in a debriefing session during which they would be asked about their experiences playing the game .<br><br><b>Results: </b>All subjects reported hearing strange noises during their play sessions, as well as seeing unusual messages written in blood appear on their screens. These messages included phrases such as <i>"You can't hide from us"</i> and <i>"We see you"</i>. Upon further questioning, all four subjects revealed that they had been unable to communicate with each other via the in game chat system despite being able to communicate with one another outside of the game using standard methods such as text messaging or telephone calls . When questioned about these results, Dr L████████ stated that he was unsurprised by these findings due to SCP - 15 270's nature but insisted that further testing should be conducted regardless . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Alright now then… I'd like you all take part in an experiment regarding SCP - 15 270 now if you would please? [D - 1527 0 1]: Sure thing man! Ask away! I've got nothing to hide from the Feds! (laughs) Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Good. Now then… I'd like you all take part in an experiment regarding SCP - 15 270 now if you would please? [D - 152 70 2]: Sure thing man! Ask away! I've got nothing to hide from the Feds! (laughs) Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Good… Now then… This is going to be very similar to your last test except this time we are going try something different… Instead of having just one subject play through it we're going have multiple people do so at once so we can get more accurate results out of our experiments…. So if everyone could grab a controller and log into server 3 over there that would be great … [D – 152 70 3 ]: Hey wait what are we doing here? We already played this game once before remember? Why do we need t oplay it again ? [AGENT <br><br><b>████████]: </b>Because our previous tests weren't conclusive enough…. We need more data before making any decisions about how dangerous this thing is so for now your just going have rejoin your friends over there okay ? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing Dr L████████'s proposal , O5 Council members approved Experiment #152 7 0 1A (<i>"The Game Is Afoot"</i>) on 11/05/20 19 after several days of deliberation .</div>
