The following is a news article about the near end of the world.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9138</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> ~~<i>SCP-9138</i>-1 is to be contained in a large empty room, but no walls are necessary. No personnel are allowed to enter <i>SCP-9138</i>'s containment chamber alone, and at least one guard must inspect the interior every 24 hours. It is unknown why this is so.~~<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9138</i> is a tree in the shape of a crucifix, roughly 1.5 meters in diameter and 2.5 meters tall. The sap within <i>SCP-9138</i> is a dark brownish green color, and has been found to have DNA similar to that of human blood.<br><br><i>SCP-9138</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual makes direct contact with the sap produced by its branches or trunk, referred to as <i>SCP-9138</i>-1 from here on out. Subjects that have been injected with this substance report being able to see into the future when looking into any reflective surface (including cameras and mirrors). It was determined by testing several volunteers that this ability cannot be used on anything other than humans; animals and inanimate objects will not show any changes due to <i>SCP-9138</i>'s effect (this includes biological function readings — it appears as if there are no effects whatsoever).<br><br>The only known way to deactivate the effects caused by <i>SCP-9138</i> is through use of amnestics; however, subjects who undergo treatment for amnesia after having touched <i>SCP-9138</i> will regain their powers upon reentering contact with its sap at any time later down the line once more; this denotes permanence of effect for all persons who come into physical contact with its sap at least once during their lifetime while not under treatment via amnestic agents. Those without prior knowledge of having ever made such an encounter can also be <i>"infected"</i> — it seems as if prolonged exposure produces faster results than merely touching it once or twice before washing off after wards, but tests indicate that such scenarios still require significant amounts of time before showing full effectiveness towards wiping out memory traces left behind from initial exposure [see Addendum 9138B]. If one does not come into contact with 9136's fluid until days later/months/years/etc., they will find themselves unable to remember what they saw before hand unless further exposed afterwards - however they will begin seeing new visions immediately following initial injection regardless.[+] show block – hide block Foretelling abilities seemingly depend heavily on how concentrated subject's own blood currently is within their body ; it has been confirmed that one must be alive for them manifest correctly - i . e . , dead subjects are unable to see anything at all through reflections despite being able to touch it normally.[+] show block – hide block Subj ects taking part in testing procedures involving loss or addition of bodily fluids report losing their foresight ability whenever blood concentrations<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9138</i> was discovered in an abandoned house in ██████, █████████ after the police received reports of a strange 'creature' roaming around the area. A Foundation agent embedded within local law enforcement was dispatched to the scene and managed to secure it without incident before bringing it back to Site-██ for containment.<br><br>Investigation into its origins is still ongoing .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9138.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9138</i>'s sap appears to have a highly mutagenic effect on human beings. Those who have been exposed to it occasionally exhibit increased strength, increased speed or resistance to physical damage, and/or various other anomalous properties .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9138.2 :</h3> Testing with <i>SCP-9138</i> has been suspended indefinitely due to the new danger posed by those affected by its sap.<br><br>Note from Dr.<br> ████: If we can't contain this thing, then I guess that means that it's time to destroy it.</div>
