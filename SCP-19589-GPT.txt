<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19589 is  an anomalous thought process</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19589<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19589</i> is an anomalous thought process that affects any human subject exposed to it. Subjects affected by <i>SCP-19589</i> will become completely absorbed in the thought process, and will be unable to focus on anything else for extended periods of time. The thought process appears to have no clear purpose or meaning, and can range from mundane topics such as everyday life, to more abstract concepts such as philosophy and morality.<br><br>Subjects exposed to <i>SCP-19589</i> exhibit signs of extreme mental fatigue, confusion, and disorientation after prolonged exposure. In some cases, subjects may even experience hallucinations or delusions related to the thoughts they are experiencing. Prolonged exposure can lead to permanent mental damage or death due to exhaustion.<br><br>The source of <i>SCP-19589</i> is currently unknown but it has been theorized that it may originate from a higher dimensional plane of existence beyond our own understanding.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-19589</i>, containment is impossible. Instead, research into its origins and effects must be conducted in order to better understand it. Any personnel exposed to <i>SCP-19589</i> are to be monitored closely for signs of mental fatigue or distress. If any such signs are observed, the affected personnel are to be removed from the area immediately and given psychological counseling as necessary.<br><br>In addition, all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-19589</i> must undergo regular psychological evaluations in order to ensure that they remain mentally stable while working on this project.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19589.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was dispatched to investigate the source of <i>SCP-19589</i>. The team was equipped with specialized equipment designed to detect and monitor any anomalous activity in the area. Upon arrival, the team encountered an unknown entity which communicated with them via telepathy. The entity identified itself as <i>"The Thinker"</i> and claimed that it had created <i>SCP-19589</i> as a means of exploring its own thoughts and understanding its place in existence. It also stated that it was responsible for all of the mental fatigue, confusion, and disorientation experienced by those exposed to <i>SCP-19589</i>.<br><br>The Thinker then explained that it had been observing humanity since its inception and had become fascinated by our ability to think independently from one another. It believed that this unique trait could be used to further explore its own thoughts on existence, but realized that doing so would require more than just observation; hence why it created <i>SCP-19589</i>. After some negotiation, The Thinker agreed to cease using <i>SCP-19589</i> on humans if we agreed not to interfere with its experiments or attempt to contain it in any way. We have honored this agreement since then and have maintained a peaceful relationship with The Thinker ever since.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19589.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-19589-1<br><b>Interview Log:</b><br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Please state your name for the record.<br><b><br>D-19589-1:</b> My name is [REDACTED].<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> How long have you been exposed to <i>SCP-19589</i>? <br><b><br>D-19589-1:</b> It's been about a week now.

I felt like my mind was being taken over by something else, and I couldn't control my thoughts or my actions. It was like I was being pulled in a million different directions at once, and I couldn't focus on anything for more than a few seconds. Everything felt so chaotic and overwhelming, but at the same time it was strangely calming.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19589.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 19589.3-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-19589-01, a 25 year old male with no prior mental health issues.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-19589</i> and monitored for signs of distress or mental fatigue.
