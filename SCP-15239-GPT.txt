Any person who attempts to enter <i>SCP-15239</i>'s building without permission will be terminated on sight. Any toys that are found outside of <i>SCP-15239</i>'s building are to be incinerated immediately (see Addendum 152391).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15239</i> is a company by the name of 1000000000000000 Degrees Fahrenheit Toys R Us, located in [REDACTED], United States. <i>SCP-15239</i> is a toy store that sells toys that are considered to be extremely dangerous. <i>SCP-15239</i> was brought to the attention of the Foundation after reports of children dying from playing with toys from <i>SCP-15239</i>. The toys sold by <i>SCP-15239</i> have been known to cause death, severe injury and mental trauma to any person who plays with them for more than 5 minutes, even if they do not attempt to play with them.<br><br><i>SCP-15239</i> was discovered after reports came in of <i>"toys"</i> being found near playgrounds, schools and other places where children frequently play. The <i>"toys"</i> were then sent into Site 19 for testing and analysis. After testing it was found out that the <i>"toys"</i> were actually anomalous objects that would cause harm or death if played with by a human being for more than 5 minutes (see Addendum 15239a). The Foundation then secured all instances of these anomalous objects and destroyed them using incineration methods (see Addendum 15239b).<br><br><i>SCP-15239</i> has also been known to sell items such as clothing, books, games and other things related to toys but these are not anomalous and can be bought without any harm coming from it (see Addendum 152391). It should also be noted that some people have claimed seeing people walk into <i>SCP-15241</i>'s building but no one has ever walked out before so this is currently under investigation (See Addendum 152392).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15239.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This is an interview with a person who claimed to have entered <i>SCP-15239</i>'s building and survived. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, Mr. ███████, please take a seat. <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Okay… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Now, I would like you to tell me what happened when you entered <i>SCP-15239</i>'s building? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Well… I was walking down the street and I saw this toy store that looked really fun so I went in there to buy some toys for my son but then when i went inside the door it locked behind me and then it started getting dark so I just stayed where i was until someone came in but no one ever did so after about 5 minutes of waiting i decided to go back out through the door but it wouldn't open! So then i waited for another 10 minutes hoping that someone would come in or out of there but no one did so after about 20 minutes of waiting a guy came up to me and asked if he could help me and he told me that the store was closed because they were having some problems with their computer system and that they would be opening again soon so he took my name down on a list saying that if anyone else comes in before them opening again they can let them know what happened here today (see Addendum 152391). After he left i waited for another 15 minutes before trying again to get out by going through the window but it wouldn't budge even though its made of glass! So after another 30 minutes had passed by someone finally opened up the door from outside while shouting <i>"Hey! There are people still inside!"</i> And as soon as we got outside all these police officers surrounded us asking us questions about why we were inside there without permission or anything like that (See Addendum 152392) After answering all their questions we were let go without any charges being pressed against us… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears as if <i>SCP-15239</i> is not just selling dangerous objects inside its building, it also has anomalous properties which prevent people from leaving once they enter its building unless given permission by an unknown individual claiming to be part of <i>SCP-15239</i>'s staff (see Addendum 152391).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15239.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br><b>Objective: </b>To test the effect of <i>SCP-15239</i>'s toys on a Class D personnel.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A Class D personnel was ordered to play with one of <i>SCP-15239</i>'s toys for 5 minutes. The toy that was used in this test was a small plastic ball with spikes on it, which is believed to be <i>SCP-15239</i>-1. The Class D personnel was then told to stop playing with the toy after 5 minutes and then terminated afterwards. After analysis it was found out that the object had punctured through his skull and caused severe brain damage, resulting in death after 2 hours of testing (see Addendum 152391). Test #: 2<br><br><b>Objective: </b>To see if any other objects from <i>SCP-15239</i> are anomalous or not. After this test all other objects were incinerated immediately (see Addendum 152391). <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A random object from <i>SCP-15239</i>'s shop were placed into an airtight container and sent into Site 19 for testing and analysis. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Analysis showed that all objects from <i>SCP-15239</i> had no anomalous properties whatsoever besides causing harm or death if played with by any human being for more than 5 minutes (See Addendum 152391). All tested items have been incinerated immediately afterwards (See Addendum 152391). Test # 3 - 12 All tests were done using different types of toys made by 1000000000000000 Degrees Fahrenheit Toys R Us as well as various other companies that sell dangerous children's toys such as [REDACTED]. Results show that all tested items had no anomalous properties whatsoever besides causing harm or death if played with by any human being for more than 5 minutes (see Addendum 152391) . All tested items have been incinerated immediately afterwards (See Addenda 152390, 131232 and 131233) . + View Interview Log - Close <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr ████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview took place shortly after Dr ████'s encounter with a toy made by 1000000000000000 Degrees Fahrenheit Toys R Us during his visit to Site 19 while doing research on the company during his free time. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr <br><br><b>█████: </b>So what happened exactly? You just walked into the store like normal? Dr <br><br><b>████: </b>Yeah I just walked in like normal…then I saw some really weird stuff there…and then I saw something really weird…I don't know how else to explain it…it looked like a doll house but there wasn't anything inside except for some kind of structure made out of wood..I don't know what it is called but you put your kids inside so they can learn how to walk properly without hurting themselves..anyway when I went up closer I could hear something coming from inside..it sounded like people talking but they weren't saying anything at first so I just stood there listening until eventually someone spoke up..but whoever it was sounded really muffled so i couldn't make out what they were saying at first until eventually they started yelling <i>"Help me! Help me!"</i> over and over again…and then suddenly everything went quiet again….so i waited around a bit before trying to open up whatever door thingy there is inside these things because i thought maybe someone got locked in accidentally or something but when i opened it up nothing happened….so i tried looking around everywhere else before going outside because maybe whoever yelled earlier ran outside while my back was turned but nobody seemed suspicious at all….so yeah thats pretty much everything…..i think im gonna go home now though because its getting late …maybe ill come back tomorrow morning …or maybe ill just stay away from here altogether…..Dr <br><br><b>█████: </b>Okay well we will talk about this more later okay? Just go home now okay? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It should be noted that shortly after this interview took place, reports came in stating several children dying due to playing with various toys made by 1000000000000000 Degrees Fahrenheit Toys R Us despite them not attempting to play them at all . It seems these reports are related somehow due to each child having died under similar circumstances according examination reports although their cause of death varies between each child depending on which toy they played with . Investigation about possible connections between these incidents is still ongoing however none has yet been found yet .</div>
