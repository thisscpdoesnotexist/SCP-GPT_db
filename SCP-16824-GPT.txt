Experiment #: 2 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-16892 was instructed to use <i>SCP-16824</i> to spawn one (1) book titled <i>"The Complete History of Everything"</i>. <br><br><b>Results: </b>One (1) book titled <i>"The Complete History of Everything"</i> appeared on the table where D-16892 was sitting . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>The item spawned by <i>SCP-16824</i> is fully under its control . Experiment #: 3 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D - 16893 was instructed to use SCP - 168 24 t o s p a w n one ( 1 ) c h i c k e n . <br><br><b>Results: </b>One ( 1 ) chicken appeared on top of the table where D - 16893 was sitting , but immediately began attacking him and pecked out his eyes before security personnel could subdue it . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>The item spawned by SCP - 168 24 is not fully under its control , and may be hostile towards anyone who attempts to use it without permission from Dr. █████████ or any other staff with Level 4 clearance or higher . Experiment #4 Date ██ / 19 / 20██ Procedure Security Guard Sargent Mclaughlin will attempt t o s p a w n one ( 1 ) m e l o d y b y J u l i u s R u b e r t S c h m i d t f r o m [REDACTED] using SC P - 168 24 Results A single sheet music for Ave Maria played over an intercom system in Site 17's cafeteria for approximately 30 seconds before being replaced with static for approximately 5 seconds , followed by another 30 second looping sequence of Ave Maria before audio recording devices were disabled at Security Guard Sargent Mclaughlin's request . Upon disabling audio recording devices , Security Guard Sargent Mclaughlin stated that he had no memory of spawning this music , nor did he remember what song it had been nor how long it had been playing prior to being disabled . Analysis The item spawned by SC P - 168 24 appears t o have some form o f cognitohazardous properties that prevent people from remembering what they have done while using SC P - 168 24 unless they are given permission beforehand or are specifically told otherwise after performing said action(s). Experiment #5 Date ██ / 21 / 20██ Procedure Security Guard Sargent Mclaughlin will attempt t o s p a w n one ( 1 ) g r e a t d e b a te between two individuals regarding whether or not God exists using SC P - 168 24 Results A live debate between Richard Dawkins and David Silverman took place in Site 17's cafeteria during lunchtime concerning whether God exists or not as per instructions given via email sent directly from Dr. █████████'s email account roughly five minutes prior at 12 pm local time stating <i>"Hey guys! I just got my hands on something really cool! It can make anything you want appear outta thin air! Wanna see? Just go down into site 17's cafeteria during lunchtime today! Oh yeah also don't forget your camera!"</i> Audio Recordings taken during this experiment revealed that neither Richard Dawkins nor David Silverman had any knowledge that they were debating each other until after their debate concluded, when both men expressed confusion over why they would have such an argument against each other in the first place when both men claimed never having met each other prior either online or offline despite having debated multiple times together previously throughout their careers as prominent figures within atheism itself. Both men refused all offers made afterwards for them both individually as well as collectively for interviews regarding this event due either refusing outright due personal reasons unrelated directly towards this experiment itself, but rather due issues unrelated directly towards themselves personally such as health problems related directly towards themselves personally themselves alone without outside interference whatsoever according to statements made publicly available via social media sources available freely across public internet forums accessible freely across public internet forums freely accessible across public internet forums freely available across public internet forums available publicly</div>
