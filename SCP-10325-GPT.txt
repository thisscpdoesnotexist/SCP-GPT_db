A Foundation agent embedded within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was dispatched to investigate the source of these noises and discovered <i>SCP-10325</i>. After determining that no human subjects were involved, the agent contacted MTF Pi-1 (<i>"City Slickers"</i>) for assistance in containing <i>SCP-10325</i> before it could be exposed to civilians. Agents successfully captured <i>SCP-10325</i> without incident and administered Class B amnestics to all witnesses present at time of capture.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10325.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, the owner of the pond in which <i>SCP-10325</i> was found.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted to determine if any humans had been involved with <i>SCP-10325</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent ███: Hello Mr.████, I'm here to ask you a few questions about your pond. <br><br><b>Mr.████: </b>Sure thing, go ahead and ask away! Agent ███: Okay, first off - do you know anything about loud croaking noises coming from your pond? <br><br><b>Mr.████: </b>Croaking? Like frogs croak? Agent ███: Yes sir, like frogs croak - have you heard anything like that? <br><br><b>Mr.████: </b>Oh yeah! I hear it all the time! It's really annoying too - keeps me up at night sometimes! Poor Jerry there gets so upset when he hears it too…Agent ███: Who is Jerry sir? <br><br><b>Mr.████: </b>That's my frog right there (points at <i>SCP-10325</i>). He was named after his grandfather Jerry who used to live in this very same pond years ago before he passed away…Agent ███: So this frog has been living in your pond for a while then? <br><br><b>Mr.████: </b>Oh yes sir he has! He's lived here ever since I bought this place from my uncle Jim back in '82 and not once have I seen him do anything weird or out of the ordinary until now that is…Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Excuse me sir but what exactly do you mean by <i>"weird"</i> behavior?<br><br>Mr.: Well let me put it this way; poor old Jerry here is usually such a happy little fella but ever since these strange noises started croaking from his throat he just hasn't been himself anymore! The poor guy barely even moves anymore and spends most of his days just sitting on top of that rock over there (points at large rock) staring into space like some sort of zombie or something…<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing all available evidence gathered during initial containment, Drs [REDACTED] concluded that <i>SCP-10325</i> had likely contracted its anomalous form of Chytrid fungus following exposure to an infected individual within its natural habitat rather than through artificial means as originally suspected by MTF agents present at time of discovery due to absence any evidence indicating human involvement with <i>SCP-10325</i> prior time its capture by Foundation personnel .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10325.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-10325-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10325</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10325</i> placed in terrarium with one (1) female Rana pipiens. <br><br><b>Result: </b><i>SCP-10325</i> immediately mounted the female and began copulating with it. After approximately ten (10) minutes, the female attempted to escape, at which point <i>SCP-10325</i> vocalized loudly and continued copulating until it was physically restrained by researchers.<br><br><b>Experiment-10325-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>One (1) male Rana pipiens. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Male introduced into terrarium containing both a male and a female of the species for five (5) minutes before being removed from terrarium. <br><br><b>Result: </b>The male immediately mounted both instances of the species present in the terrarium, copulating with each for approximately ten (10) seconds before attempting to mount itself .<br><br></div>
