When rung, <i>SCP-17335</i> will summon an indeterminate number of flying monkeys from an unknown source that will proceed to attack any living creature within its vicinity. The monkeys are capable of flight and possess superhuman strength and agility, making them difficult to evade or contain.<br><br>The summoned monkeys will remain active until either all living creatures have been eliminated or <i>SCP-17335</i> is rung again; at which point they will vanish immediately without leaving behind any trace of their existence. It has been observed that the summoned monkeys do not appear to be aggressive towards each other, instead focusing their attention on attacking whatever target they were initially summoned for.<br><br>It should be noted that while the effects of <i>SCP-17335</i> are dangerous, they can be neutralized by ringing another bell or other similar sound producing object before the summoning process is complete; this has proven effective in stopping further summons from being made and allowing personnel time to evacuate affected areas before further damage can occur.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17335</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██ when not in use. Personnel assigned to handle <i>SCP-17335</i> must wear protective gear and are instructed to ring another bell or similar sound producing object immediately after ringing <i>SCP-17335</i>, should the need arise.<br><br>Any personnel who come into contact with the summoned monkeys are to be treated for any injuries sustained and monitored for any signs of infection or other anomalous effects.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17335.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ when <i>SCP-17335</i> was accidentally rung by personnel who were unaware of its properties. During the incident, numerous monkeys were summoned and several members of staff were injured before the breach could be contained. All affected personnel have since been treated for their injuries and <i>SCP-17335</i> has been returned to secure containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17335.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17335</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> What is the purpose of <i>SCP-17335</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17335</i>:</b> To protect those who are in need of protection, from those who would do them harm.
