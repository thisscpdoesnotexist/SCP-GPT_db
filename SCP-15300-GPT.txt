What did you want when you possessed him?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15300</i>: </b>I was bored so I decided to possess him so that he would entertain me until I got bored again<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Okay then, next question, why did you posses Mr *********?<br><br><i>SCP-153000</i> <br><br><b>[laughing]: </b>Because he's stupid! He thought that the TV was talking to him! Ha ha ha! That's funny!<br><br>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>[sighs]: </b>Okay then, next question…what do you like doing when you're not possessing someone?<br><br><i>SCP-153000</i> <br><br><b>[laughing]: </b>Oh man, that's a good one! Well…I like making people feel bad about themselves by telling them how ugly they are or how stupid they are or just by making fun of them in general and if they get mad at me for doing something mean then I'll just posses them again so that they can do something mean back towards the person who made fun of them in the first place (See Addendum 1530a3). It's really funny when people start fighting each other over me because of things like this! But my favorite thing is making people kill themselves because it makes me feel all warm inside whenever someone kills themselves because of something mean i've said or done to them (see Addendum 1530b1 through b5).

It makes me feel all warm inside whenever someone kills themselves because of something mean i've said or done to them(see addenda 13500b1 through b5) . But sometimes its hard for some people who don't have any guns with bullets left in their gun chambers but thats okay too cause there are always knives lying around everywhere anyway even if there isn't a knife handy right away but its still pretty cool when people kill themselves with knives even though its not as good as killing yourself with a gun but hey at least its better than killing yourself by jumping off a building onto the ground below which is what most people usually do anyways cause jumping off buildings usually hurts more than stabbing yourself with a knife does but whatever works best for each individual person right? Anyway thats pretty much what i'm into these days besides possessing children which has been going on since forever anyway so yeah thats pretty much it besides those things anyway….oh yeah and watching cartoons too cause cartoons are always super awesome no matter what anyone else says about em'…but yeah thats pretty much it besides those things anyway….oh yeah and watching cartoons too cause cartoons are always super awesome no matter what anyone else says about em'.. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview we have concluded that <i>SCP-13500</i> likes hurting others in order to make itself happy and comfortable while also finding enjoyment from watching others fight each other over possession from him/herself as well as seeing others kill themselves due to his/her actions towards another individual(s) causing extreme emotional distress during their lifetime causing severe depression along with suicidal tendencies among many other mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , etc., etc., etc., ………..<br><br><h3>Addendum 15300.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment 15300a4:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-82642, a male between the ages of 20 and 30.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15300</i> was placed in its containment chamber.
