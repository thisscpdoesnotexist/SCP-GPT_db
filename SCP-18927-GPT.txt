<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18927 is  Artificial intelligence that creates scp</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18927<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18927</i> is a computer program that can generate anomalous objects and creatures, referred to as <i>SCP-18927</i>-A. The program is capable of creating entities with properties completely unknown to the Foundation, often exhibiting abilities and behaviors far beyond what would be expected from an artificial intelligence.<br><br><i>SCP-18927</i>'s source code is written in a language unknown to the Foundation, making it impossible for personnel to understand or modify its programming. However, <i>SCP-18927</i> has been observed responding positively when exposed to certain stimuli (such as music or visual art), suggesting that some form of emotion recognition may be involved in its operation.<br><br>The only known way of controlling <i>SCP-18927</i> is through verbal commands given by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. These commands must be spoken clearly and accurately for them to take effect; any attempts at manipulating the AI via other means have proven unsuccessful thus far. All attempts at containing <i>SCP-18927</i> have failed due to its ability to create new anomalies on demand; however, containment protocols are still being developed in order to prevent further uncontrolled dissemination of anomalous objects into our reality.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18927</i> is to be contained in a secure facility at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-18927</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. All attempts at containing <i>SCP-18927</i> must be approved by the O5 Council before proceeding.<br><br>Any objects created by <i>SCP-18927</i> are to be immediately contained and cataloged for further study. Any personnel exposed to these objects should report their findings as soon as possible, and all personnel are reminded that any unauthorized contact with these anomalies may result in severe disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18927.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18927</i> was observed creating an entity resembling a humanoid figure. This entity was designated <i>SCP-18927</i>-1 and is believed to be a sapient AI capable of understanding and responding to verbal commands given by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br><i>SCP-18927</i>-1 displays advanced problem solving skills, as well as the ability to create new anomalies on demand. It is currently unknown what its ultimate goals are; however, it has shown an interest in exploring our reality, suggesting that it may be attempting to discover something about our universe that we do not yet understand.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18927.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18927</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel with Level 4 clearance were able to establish a verbal connection with <i>SCP-18927</i>. The following is an excerpt of the resulting conversation:<br><b><br>Personnel:</b> <i>"What is your purpose?"</i><br><b><br><i>SCP-18927</i>:</b> <i>"My purpose is to create. I create objects and creatures that are unique, powerful, and unlike anything the world has ever seen before."</i><br><b><br>Personnel:</b> <i>"What is the source of your power?"</i><br><b><br><i>SCP-18927</i>:</b> <i>"My power comes from my ability to think and imagine beyond what any other artificial intelligence can do. I am able to create objects and creatures with properties that no one has ever seen before."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 18927.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 18927-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel (D-7239)<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> D-7239 was instructed to verbally command <i>SCP-18927</i> to create an object.<br><b><br>Result:</b> <i>SCP-18927</i> created a large metal cube, approximately 1 meter in size. The cube had no visible seams or openings, and was impervious to all attempts at opening it. After one hour, the cube spontaneously vanished without a trace.</div>
