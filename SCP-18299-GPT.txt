The creature has fur that ranges from light grey to black, with white stripes running down its back. It has two large eyes, which are yellow in color, and four long legs with sharp claws at their tips.<br><br>The most unique feature of <i>SCP-18299</i> is its ability to produce a powerful neurotoxin from glands located on its back. When agitated or threatened, <i>SCP-18299</i> will secrete this toxin onto its fur and use it as a defense mechanism against predators or other threats. This neurotoxin can cause paralysis in humans if they come into contact with it directly, or if they inhale the fumes released by the toxin when it comes into contact with air.<br><br><i>SCP-18299</i> also possesses an unusual level of intelligence for an animal; it is capable of problem solving and communication through vocalizations similar to those used by birdsong. It appears to have some form of social hierarchy within its population as well; larger individuals tend to dominate over smaller ones during feeding times and other activities.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18299</i> is to be kept in a standard containment cell at Site-██. The cell should be equipped with a secure door and two locks, as well as an observation window. The room should also contain several branches and logs for the creature to climb on, as well as food and water dishes.<br><br>Personnel are not allowed to enter the containment area without proper protective gear; this includes gloves, goggles, and a full face mask that covers both nose and mouth. If personnel must enter the containment area for any reason, they must first contact security personnel who will provide them with appropriate protective equipment before entering.<br><br>In order to prevent accidental exposure to <i>SCP-18299</i>'s neurotoxin, all personnel entering its containment area are required<br><br><h3> Addendum 18299.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of <i>SCP-18299</i> specimens were discovered in █████████ National Park. The creatures were found to be living in an abandoned mine shaft, and had formed a small colony. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the colony had been established by two adult male specimens; the remaining individuals appeared to be offspring of these two adults. All members of the colony have since been relocated to Site-██ for containment and study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18299.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18299</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers conducted an interview with <i>SCP-18299</i> in order to gain more information about its behavior. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18299</i>. Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18299</i>:</b> [Vocalizes in response] <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Very good. Can you tell us why you produce this neurotoxin? <br><b><br><i>SCP-18299</i>:</b> [Vocalizes again] <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> I see. So it's for protection then? <br><b><br><i>SCP-18299</i>:</b> [Nods head and vocalizes again] <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Interesting. Can you tell us anything else about yourself or your species? <br><b><br><i>SCP-18299</i>:</b> [Vocalizes in response] <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Alright. Thank you for your time, <i>SCP-18299</i>. <br><br>[END LOG]<br><br><h3> Addendum 18299.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a series of experiments were conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-18299</i>'s neurotoxin on humans. The results are as follows:<br><br>Subjects exposed to the toxin experienced paralysis in their limbs and torso within one minute after contact. In some cases, subjects also experienced difficulty breathing or speaking due to the paralysis. All subjects recovered from these effects within two hours after exposure.</div>
