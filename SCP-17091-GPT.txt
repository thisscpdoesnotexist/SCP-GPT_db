<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-17091</i> is  Murder mittens</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17091</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17091</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██. The locker must be monitored 24/7 and any attempts to open it without authorization will result in immediate termination of the individual responsible.<br><br>Any personnel found wearing <i>SCP-17091</i> are to be immediately restrained and placed into solitary confinement until further notice. Any victims or witnesses of homicide or attempted homicide caused by <i>SCP-17091</i> are to be administered Class A amnestics and released with no memory of the incident.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17091</i> is a pair of red and black mittens, made from wool and cotton. The mittens are approximately 25 cm in length, with the palm area measuring 15 cm in diameter.<br><br>When worn by any living organism, <i>SCP-17091</i> will cause an uncontrollable urge to murder any living creature within its vicinity. This effect extends up to 20 meters from the wearer of <i>SCP-17091</i>. The only way to prevent this effect is for the wearer to remove <i>SCP-17091</i> from their body immediately after putting them on.<br><br>When not being worn, <i>SCP-17091</i> does not exhibit any anomalous properties. However if left untouched for more than 24 hours it will become animate and begin searching for a new host to wear it on. It has been observed that once a subject wears <i>SCP-17091</i> they become unable to take them off due to an unknown force preventing them from doing so until they have committed at least one act of homicide or attempted homicide while wearing it. Subjects who have successfully managed to remove themselves from the influence of <i>SCP-17091</i> report having had no recollection of events that occurred while under its effects other than feeling compelled towards violence when wearing it; however all victims found dead near subjects wearing SCP 1791 show signs consistent with homicide even if no witnesses were present at the time of death or during the attack itself; suggesting that some form memory alteration may be occurring as well as physical compulsion towards violence when wearing it . <br><br>Once removed, subjects appear unharmed physically but are often found in states of extreme distress due psychological trauma caused by their experience withSCP 1791 .  All attempts at destroying or containingSCP 1791 have failed thus far , leading researchers believe that some formof extradimensional origin may be responsible for its existence .<br><br><h3>Addendum 17091.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of individuals wearing <i>SCP-17091</i> were seen entering Site-██. The group was quickly subdued and detained by security personnel. After interrogation, it was revealed that the individuals had been sent to retrieve <i>SCP-17091</i> by an unknown entity referred to as “The Voice”. All members of the group were administered Class A amnestics and released with no memory of their mission or the events leading up to it.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17091.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-17091</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Can you tell me about yourself?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17091</i>: </b>I am a pair of red and black mittens, made from wool and cotton.
