This includes clothing that once belonged to <i>SCP-9628</i> himself, so he is always required to wear a jacket at all times during transfer or testing procedures. If an individual comes within this range, it will begin showing symptoms similar to that of paranoid schizophrenia for three (3) days afterward; after which they will return to normal function for three (3) days. The subject will believe that their loved ones are attempting to kill them and/or their friends by any means necessary including death threats, tampering with food supplies or weapons around them and physical assault.<br><br>If an individual has been exposed before however, they are immune from these affects until next exposure; regardless if they have come into contact since last exposure or not. After this point only becoming re infected is possible through direct skin contact with <i>SCP-9628</i>'s blood stream through cuts in his skin caused by scratching as well as biting him on the neck (however biting him on other parts such as hands can cause infection without being covered in blood). Re infecting someone causes all previous symptoms experienced via SCP 9628's anomalous properties again but has been found to increase intensity slightly each time it occurs up until five hundred and eighty six thousand four hundred twenty nine exposures between the same two individuals have occurred where the victim suffers complete brain damage after which they die from shock trauma upon viewing what appears out be [DATA EXPUNGED] . Once death occurs however one day later [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9628</i> was discovered by the Foundation after reports of events similar to those caused by <i>SCP-9628</i>'s anomalous properties were reported in ██████, Washington.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9628.1 :</h3> Interview Log.<br><br>+<br> Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log D-8802: Ok so we're gonna try this again… [D-8802 enters room]<br> <i>SCP-9628</i>: What do you want?<br> D-8802: Where did you come from?<br> <i>SCP-9628</i>: I'm not telling that to a stranger.<br> D-8802: You will tell me what I need to know!
