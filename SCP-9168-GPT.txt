The electric field can be measured by a positive charge of +1 ~ +5 nC, which is completely harmless for humans. Animals are not affected by the anomaly and don't seem to notice it at all.<br><br><i>SCP-9168</i> seems to have a good relationship with the personnel working in the sector, and often plays with them when they are on duty . It also loves to eat ham sandwiches and play video games about animals such as <i>"Animal Crossing"</i>, <i>"Fur Fighters"</i> or <i>"Creative Isle"</i>. In addition, <i>SCP-9168</i> is able to understand human commands since its capture date (██/██/████) with 99% of accuracy. However, due to its small size, it can only carry out simple orders such as <i>"sit down"</i>, <i>"stay"</i> or <i>"come here"</i>. <i>SCP-9168</i> has been trained on how to use doors , walk on two legs , use bathroom facilities , drink from cups etc… Because it's very sociable during daytime (10:00 ~ 18:00), personnel should interact with him frequently so that he doesn't feel lonely during his Foundation life .<br><br>Document # 9168_2 : Audio Log 9 / 16 / 19███<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9168</i> was recovered on 19██ when it was found near a forest in ██████, Canada by MTF Theta-7 <i>"Wolfpack"</i> during a routine patrol. It seems like the mouse has lost its way and became trapped in <i>SCP-9168</i>'s anomaly. After that, <i>SCP-9168</i> was captured alive and brought to Site-42 for further analysis before being assigned an object class.<br><br><Begin Log><br> Dr V████ : Hello SCP 9168 . I'm here to check your recovery. Can you tell me what happened? [SCP 9169 is seated on a stool near Dr V████.]<br> SCP 9169: Oh hi! My name is ███ (name redacted). I used to live in my house but then one day I got lost. Then some people caught me and put me here… I have been feeling sad since then because nobody comes to visit me…<br> Dr V████ : Don't worry, you will get used to it soon enough!<br><br><h3>Addendum 9168.1 :</h3><br><br>+ Dr. V████'<br>s Diary - Close Incident: 9168-5 Date: 19██/██/██ I'm so glad to have 9168 with us! He is such a cute and friendly mouse, and he always makes me feel happy when we are together. Well, except when he has no food. He's always hungry! A while ago, he helped me find my keys when they were lost in the office; that was really helpful since I had no time before going home…<br><br><br>Incident: 9168-5 Date: 19██/██/█ <i>SCP-9168</i> was found missing during a routine inspection on the next day after Dr V████ wrote her diary entry above. After the search started and finished without success, an investigation lead by Agent █████ revealed that all Level 1 staff members in Sector ██ were affected by <i>SCP-9169</i>'<br>s anomaly at 12:00 AM on 19██/██/█ . The affected personnel mentioned feeling tired or suffering from slight headaches in their interview with Agent █████ as well as several other symptoms such as nausea , dizziness , hallucinations etc…. Every person who slept within 2m of <i>SCP-9169</i> for 2 hours or more were considered <i>"infected"</i>. Luckily most of them just went to sleep right after being exposed to <i>SCP-9169</i> causing only minor mental harm (the effects lasted for less than 24 hours). However, 5 people developed chronic conditions after sleeping near it for more than 4 hours (see Addendum 9168.2). Due to this incident and its claim that it <i>"got lost"</i>, the decision was made not to release <i>SCP-9169</i> back into the wild . The mouse was moved into Sector A where it currently lives under heavy surveillance along with D class personal assigned to take care of him during daytime .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9168.2 :</h3><br><br>+<br> Incident Log 9168-A - Close Date: 19██/██/<br>██ Personnel Affected: D-9167, D-9177, D-9188 and Dr. V████<br><br><br>Symptoms: Insomnia (lasting 1 week), mild headaches, dizziness and nausea. Affected personnel were given Class A amnestics after examination.<br> Close Incident: 9168 - A Date: 19██ / 10 / 1 0 Agent █████ was affected by <i>SCP-9169</i>'<br>s anomaly when he tried to enter his room in Sector ██ at 09 : 00 AM on 19██ / 10 / 01 . However, Dr. V████'s room is located near the entrance of the sector so it is possible that SCP - 9169 used its anomaly to attract Agent █████ . After the incident was reported by Agent █████ , a full investigation was carried out which resulted in confirmation that SCP - 9169 used its anomalous properties to lure people into his containment cell during nighttime . This allowed it to move freely within Sector A without being detected by security cameras or personnel as well as making sure it won't be alone at night.<br></div>
