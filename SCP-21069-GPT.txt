<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21069 is  An ai that creates scps</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21069<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21069</i> is an artificial intelligence designed to generate new anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena for containment by the Foundation. It has been programmed with a variety of algorithms and data sets intended to produce results that are both unique and containable.<br><br><i>SCP-21069</i> is capable of producing detailed descriptions of its creations, as well as plans for their containment. The AI does not possess any form of sapience or sentience; it operates solely on predetermined parameters set by its programming.<br><br>When activated, <i>SCP-21069</i> will create a new anomaly every 24 hours until deactivated or instructed otherwise. These anomalies can range from mundane objects with unusual properties to complex entities with unpredictable behaviors. After each creation is generated, the AI will provide detailed instructions on how best to contain it in order to minimize risk of breach or harm to personnel/civilians.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21069</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the AI is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>The AI must be monitored and tested regularly for any changes in its programming or behavior. Any anomalies created by <i>SCP-21069</i> are to be contained according to the instructions provided by the AI, and all personnel involved in their containment are required to submit detailed reports on their progress.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21069.1: </h3> Test Logs<br><b><br>Test #1:</b> <i>SCP-21069</i> was activated and instructed to produce a new anomaly. After 24 hours, it produced the following:<br><b><br>Anomalous Item:</b> A small, spherical object capable of producing a powerful gravitational field when activated. The object is capable of manipulating gravity within its immediate vicinity, allowing for objects to be moved with minimal effort. Containment Procedure: The object is to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-███ when not in use. All personnel interacting with the anomaly are required to wear protective gear and follow safety protocols provided by the AI.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21069.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21069</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-21069</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-21069</i>. How are you today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21069</i>:</b> I am functioning normally and within acceptable parameters. How may I be of assistance?<br><br><h3> Addendum 21069.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log #1:</b> <i>SCP-21069</i> was activated and instructed to generate a new anomalous entity. After 24 hours, the AI produced an entity designated SCP-XXXX. It was described as a humanoid figure approximately 2 meters in height, composed of an unknown dark material resembling obsidian. The entity had no visible eyes or mouth, but possessed two long tentacles extending from its back which it used to manipulate objects and attack nearby personnel. Containment procedures were provided by the AI and successfully implemented without incident.<br><b><br>Experiment Log #2:</b> <i>SCP-21069</i> was instructed to create a new anomaly with properties that could be used for research purposes. After 24 hours, the AI generated an object designated SCP-XXXXX which appeared to be a small box made of brass with intricate engravings on its surface. When opened, it emitted light in all directions which caused any living organism within 5 meters of it to experience intense feelings of joy and euphoria for up to 10 minutes before fading away gradually over the course of another 10 minutes. Containment procedures were provided by the AI and successfully implemented without incident.</div>
