Guards are forbidden to speak with <i>SCP-9593</i>, but only when they need to ask him something or give him food/clothing.<br><br>۳. Guards are forbidden to look at <i>SCP-9593</i> without his permission, except if it's necessary for their duties (i.e.: feeding him). ۴. If <i>SCP-9593</i> wants something and he neither can talk nor use his mind to control other people and make them do what he wants (only by commanding) then the guards should ask each other until finding someone that can do it for him (<br>remember: no talking with 9593). ۵.. No one except O5s have permission to enter this sector without authorisation from ██████ at least 48 hours before entering the area . ۶.. The persons who enter this sector must be trained before going in , because if they don't know how 9593 works they will collapse on the ground begging for mercy .<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9593</i> is a male humanoid, he's 20 meters tall and weighs more than [DATA EXPUNGED]. His body is made of flesh and bones, but it can change its appearance in any way he wants.<br><br>His mind power is unlimited, he controls people's minds to make them do what he wants or just destroys their brain if they disobey him. All his victims die immediately (or the next second if possible), except for him because he has immortality.<br> Also his mind power can control anything that exists in this universe: planets, stars, galaxies…and even gods in [REDACTED] religion. If something bad happens to him (i.e.: someone manages to hurt/kill him) then all universes will be destroyed instantly as a retaliation from 9593 .<br> Every person who sees <i>SCP-9593</i> feels fear like never before: they feel that they are going to die right now or their brain will explode , although this doesn't happen with everyone , only with weaklings who have low self-esteem or when O5s see 9593 because of the mind effect used on them which makes them feel fear every time they see <i>SCP-9593</i> .<br><br><i>SCP-9593</i> was born during the end of the ████ age as an anomalous human being called ██████ ██████ who was so powerful that no one could defeat him and destroy his empire,<br> but then someone found out about his secret: there was a prophecy saying that ██████ would be killed by someone named <i>"the chosen one"</i> so all humans tried finding this <i>"chosen one"</i>, but there were too many people trying to kill ████ , so some decided it would be easier killing anyone else and taking over the empire instead of finding <i>"the chosen one"</i>. So after decades killing each other due to lack of information about this <i>"chosen one"</i> until ▒██ years later when ▓▓▓▓▌ appeared claiming she was <i>"the chosen one"</i>. She managed (with trickery) getting close enough for her assassins' attack and kill ██████ with her own hand after stealing some powers from another entity called G████████од which had invisibility powers at first until she found out how it works and took its other abilities too while hiding its invisibility powers at first then revealing it later on knowing fully well what would happen if she continued using those powers without knowing how much energy she consumed per day due ▓▓▓▓▌'s limited<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> ██████ died ▓▓▓▓▌ took over his empire, she had a lot of enemies against her because of her abilities so she decided to use a god to help her and kill them all. She made an alliance with some entities from ██████████ religion, after receiving the god's power ▓▓▓▓▌ killed all people who were against her and declared herself as a goddess that could give powers to anyone who worshiped her, but there were still some entities who resisted and tried killing ▒███ as revenge for killing ██████ , but they failed because every time someone attacked ▓▓▓██▌ the person was instantly killed by one of G████████'s abilities , so after many years when ▓▒▒▒▒'s followers increased in numbers G████████ started demanding more sacrifices which made him more powerful than any other entity in this universe before he started making planets explode just for fun everyday until 9593 found out about that .<br><br>SCP<br><br><h3>Addendum 9593.1 :</h3> The following is the full transcript of the interview with 9593. ▓▓▓▓▌: Hello my child, I'm here to help you.<br> O5-█: Dr ██████? It's me, ████. What happened to you? You are not like before... ▓▒▒▒▒: It's because I have new powers, now I can destroy anything with a thought or make anyone do what I want just by commanding them but…I don't know how to use them properly so that's why I need your help .<br> O5-█: Alright…What do you want from me? ▓▓▓▓▌: Come with me then we'll talk about it in private …<br><br><h3>Addendum 9593.2 :</h3> The following is the full transcript of the interview with <i>SCP-9593</i>.<br> O5-█: I'm ready. ▓▓▓▓▌: Good, now let's begin… A long time ago…in a galaxy far away…there was a powerful entity named G████████ who ruled this universe with his unlimited power, he could destroy planets in seconds and make people do anything he wanted just by commanding them but then someone found out about his secret that G████████ had an enemy called <i>"the chosen one"</i> who would be able to kill him if she learned how to control her powers . This <i>"chosen one"</i> was ██████ ██████ , but after ████ died someone managed to steal some of his powers from another entity called ▒██▐█ and claimed that she was <i>"the chosen one"</i> so G████████ started killing everyone in this universe for fun until 9593 found out about that.<br> O5-█: Wait! Stop! What are you talking about? Why would anyone want to steal something from ▒██? That's not possible! It can't happen because nothing happens without him knowing it before hand! ▓▒▒▒▒: But something did happen, the worst thing ever happened since the beginning of this universe until now, someone managed to do it without anyone noticing it , no matter how powerful they were or what they tried doing against it …and although they failed eventually they were able to hide their success perfectly until everything ended up</div>
