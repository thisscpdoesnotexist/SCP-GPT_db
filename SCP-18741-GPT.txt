<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18741 is  a perturbed D class enable to reload a website</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18741<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18741</i> is a perturbed D class personnel, capable of reloading websites or webpages at will. When <i>SCP-18741</i> enters a website's URL into its browser window, the page will immediately be refreshed and any changes made to it since the last time it was accessed by <i>SCP-18741</i> will be reverted.<br><br><i>SCP-18741</i> has no control over this ability and cannot prevent the website from being reloaded when it attempts to access it. Additionally, any attempts to modify or delete content on the site are unsuccessful; instead, they are reversed once <i>SCP-18741</i> leaves the webpage.<br><br>The range of <i>SCP-18741</i>'s abilities appears to be limited only by its physical presence; if an internet connection is established between two computers in which one computer has been exposed to <i>SCP-18741</i>'s presence within a certain distance (currently estimated at approximately 10 meters), then all websites visited by both computers will also be affected. This effect does not diminish with distance and can even affect multiple devices connected through Wi-Fi networks or other forms of wireless communication.<br><br>Attempts to contain or neutralize <i>SCP-18741</i> have proven unsuccessful due to its anomalous properties; however, containment protocols have been implemented in order to limit exposure as much as possible: All personnel entering areas where SCP- 18741 is present must wear protective clothing and use specialized equipment designed specifically for this purpose. In addition, all electronics brought into these areas must first undergo thorough decontamination procedures before they can enter restricted zones containing active instances ofSCP - 18741 .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-18741</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with an internet connection, and all personnel entering the area must wear protective clothing and use specialized equipment designed specifically for this purpose.<br><br>Personnel are not allowed to access any websites while <i>SCP-18741</i> is present in its containment chamber, as doing so may cause unexpected changes or reversals of website content. In addition, all electronics brought into the area must first undergo thorough decontamination procedures before they can enter restricted zones containing active instances of SCP - 18741 .<br><br><h3> Addendum 18741.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18741</i> was able to access a website located on the dark web and successfully reload it. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that this site contained information regarding an anomalous item of unknown origin. The item's description is currently being investigated by Foundation personnel; however, any attempts to access the site have been unsuccessful since <i>SCP-18741</i>'s initial visit.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18741.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18741</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18741</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, what can you tell me about your ability?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18741</i>:</b> I don't know much about it. All I know is that when I enter a website's URL into my browser window, the page will immediately be refreshed and any changes made to it since the last time I accessed it will be reverted.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Is there anything else you can tell me about it?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18741</i>:</b> No, that's all I know. It's like a reflex for me; I don't even have to think about it, it just happens automatically when I access a website.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18741.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-18741</i> was instructed to access a website containing an article about the effects of global warming. Upon entering the URL, the page immediately reloaded and all changes made to it since its last visit were reverted.<br><b><br>Result:</b> The article's content was unchanged from its original state, despite any alterations made in the interim.</div>
