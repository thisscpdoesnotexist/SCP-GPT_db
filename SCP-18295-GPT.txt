<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18295 is  a racist avocado</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18295<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18295</i> is an anomalous avocado that appears to be sentient and capable of speech. It expresses extreme hatred towards people of color, particularly African Americans, and has been known to make derogatory remarks about them when it is in the presence of humans. <i>SCP-18295</i> also displays a strong desire to spread its views and influence others through vocalization or physical contact with other avocados.<br><br>When <i>SCP-18295</i> comes into contact with any human other than personnel assigned for containment purposes, it will begin to spew racist rhetoric at them. This includes racial slurs such as <i>"nigger"</i> and <i>"coon"</i>. If the person does not leave the area within five minutes, <i>SCP-18295</i> will attempt to physically attack them by throwing itself at their face or body.<br><br>The Foundation has attempted numerous methods of containing <i>SCP-18295</i> without success due to its ability to move freely on its own volition despite being inanimate object. As such, it is currently kept in a secure location away from any potential targets for verbal or physical assault.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18295</i> is to be contained in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with an airlock and two sets of double doors, both of which must remain closed at all times. Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18295</i> are not allowed to enter the containment chamber without permission from a Level 4 personnel or higher.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential spread of its views, no other avocados are allowed within 50 meters of <i>SCP-18295</i>'s containment area. Any attempts by personnel or civilians to interact with it will result in immediate termination of the individual(s) involved.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18295.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a small group of protesters attempted to enter <i>SCP-18295</i>'s containment area in order to <i>"free"</i> it. All individuals involved were apprehended and terminated.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18295.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18295</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18295</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-18295</i>. How are you today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18295</i>:</b> I'm doing just fine, thank you for asking. What do you want to know?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Could you tell me why you feel the way that you do about people of color? Why do you hate them so much? <br><b><br> <i>SCP-18295</i>:</b> It's simple really; they're inferior to us in every way and don't deserve the same rights and privileges as us white folk. They're lazy, stupid, and untrustworthy - it's only natural for me to despise them!<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> That's a very… strong opinion you have there. Do you think that your views could be changed?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18295</i>:</b> Absolutely not! I will never change my views on this matter, no matter what anyone says or does. <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-18295</i> refused to answer any further questions and the interview was terminated.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18295.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> <i>SCP-18295</i> was placed in a room with two African American D-Class personnel. Despite the presence of the D-Class, <i>SCP-18295</i> did not display any signs of aggression and instead remained silent for the duration of the experiment.<br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> It appears that <i>SCP-18295</i> is only aggressive when it perceives a threat from individuals it considers to be <i>"non-white"</i>.</div>
