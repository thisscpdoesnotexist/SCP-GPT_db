It has been observed consuming volumes equivalent to that contained within the Atlantic Ocean at least once per month. <i>SCP-17161</i> does not appear to have any other observable behavior patterns or objectives besides this activity.<br><br>Attempts to communicate with <i>SCP-17161</i> have thus far been unsuccessful; it does not respond to any forms of communication from Foundation personnel or other sources.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17161</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Any attempts to approach <i>SCP-17161</i> must be approved by the Site Director.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-17161</i> from consuming too much liquid, a containment protocol has been established wherein a large quantity of soda or other carbonated beverages are placed within its vicinity every month. This is done in order to limit its consumption and avoid any potential damage that could result from it drinking too much liquid.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17161.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17161</i> was observed consuming a large quantity of liquid from the Atlantic Ocean. Analysis of the liquid revealed that it was composed of various organic compounds and metals which were not present in any known terrestrial environment. Further analysis is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17161.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17161</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation research team attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-17161</i>. The following is an excerpt from the resulting transcript:<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17161</i>. Can you understand us?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17161</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> We just want to talk. Is there anything you can tell us?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17161</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><b><br>Research Team:</b> We understand that you are drinking a large quantity of soda. Is there any reason why?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17161</i>:</b> [Silence]<br><br><h3> Addendum 17161.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17161</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> A large quantity of soda was placed within <i>SCP-17161</i>'s vicinity.
