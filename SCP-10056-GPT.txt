Testing with D-Class personnel is currently prohibited until further notice.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10056</i> is a DVD copy of the Karate Kid trilogy. The anomalous properties of <i>SCP-10056</i> manifest when a subject views any one of the films contained on it. Subjects who view <i>SCP-10056</i> will become convinced that they are Daniel LaRusso and that they must travel to an area in Japan known as Miyagi Prefecture to train under the tutelage of Mr. Miyagi, despite having no prior knowledge about either character or location.<br><br>Subjects who view <i>SCP-10056</i> will also believe that they have been transported back in time to 1984, despite all evidence suggesting otherwise, and will make several comments regarding their surroundings as if they were actually in 1984. This effect extends to all individuals within line of sight with the subject; however, only one individual can be affected at a time by this property. If another individual views <i>SCP-10056</i> while an affected individual is present, then both individuals will believe themselves to be transported back in time along with the first subject viewing it; however, neither subject's perception or memories are altered by this process until after viewing has ceased . In addition, subjects do not require direct line of sight with each other for this effect to occur but instead simply need visual contact with each other at some point during exposure .<br><br>After viewing <i>SCP-10056</i> once , subjects become increasingly agitated and distressed over their inability to return <i>"home"</i> until such time as they have traveled to Miyagi Prefecture and trained under Mr . Miyagi's tutelage . Subjects may attempt various methods for returning home , including traveling great distances on foot or attempting intercontinental travel via aircraft; however , these attempts invariably fail due to circumstances outside their control ( e . g., lack of funds , inability to secure transportation ) preventing them from reaching their destination . Subjects typically express extreme frustration over these setbacks but continue attempting them regardless ; repeat attempts appear more likely than not due primarily due subjects' belief that there is something preventing them from returning home which can only be overcome through perseverance and determination ( see Addendum 10056 - 1 ) rather than any actual desire on their part for success . As such , repeated failures do not appear sufficient enough cause subjects cease trying altogether after a certain number of attempts ; instead , most appear resigned into believing failure inevitable until such time as they manage succeed through some unknown means ( see Addendum 10056 - 2 ) . In addition, repeated failures seem less likely if subjects are allowed access beforehand information about how difficult reaching Japan<br><br><h3>Addendum 10056.1 : </h3> ████ ███████, a D-Class personnel who viewed <i>SCP-10056</i> and subsequently attempted to travel to Miyagi Prefecture on foot, was interviewed after his capture by Foundation agents. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>████ ███████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr . <br><br><b>██████: </b>So , why did you decide to walk all the way from [REDACTED]?<br><br><i>SCP-10056</i> prior to containment.

It's like…it's like there's something holding me here that I can't get rid of no matter how hard I try . It's not like this place is so bad or anything; but there are times when I just feel really homesick for my real house and my real friends at school…and then other times where I'm pretty sure that if only Mr . Miyagi were here , he could help me out somehow… Dr . <br><br><b>██████: </b>Do you think you'll ever manage find your way home? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>No way man ; not unless Mr . Miyagi shows up or something first — which doesn't seem likely at all right now — but even then, who knows how long it'll take him before he helps me out? And until then, well , what else am I supposed do while waiting around for him besides keep trying ? ( subject pauses ) Oh yeah ! You know what ? Maybe if we got a bunch of people together who also want their homes back , maybe they could help us figure out some way of getting there! We could form our own team or something ! That'd be awesome !

In addition, subjects appear less likely attempt travel alone if given access beforehand information about how difficult reaching Japan would be without assistance from others ( see Addendum 10056 - 4 ).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10056.2 : </h3>Interview with  ████ ███████, a D-Class personnel who viewed <i>SCP-10056</i> and subsequently attempted to travel to Miyagi Prefecture via airplane.
