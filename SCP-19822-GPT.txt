<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19822 is  a tree with blood on leaves</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19822<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19822</i> is a large white oak tree (Quercus alba) located in ████████, Pennsylvania. The leaves of the tree are covered in a thin layer of blood and have an anomalous property. When touched by any living organism, they will cause the organism to experience a feeling of intense fear and dread.<br><br>The origin of this effect is unknown, but it has been observed that when the leaves are removed from <i>SCP-19822</i>, they lose their anomalous properties and become normal oak leaves. It is also unknown how long these effects last after contact with the leaves or if there are any other anomalies associated with them.<br><br>The tree itself appears to be in good health and shows no signs of damage or disease; however, it does not appear to produce new leaves as often as normal trees do. Attempts to transplant <i>SCP-19822</i> have failed due to its apparent inability to take root outside its original location.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19822</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber at Site ██. Access to the tree is restricted and personnel must wear protective gear when handling it. All leaves removed from <i>SCP-19822</i> must be stored in a secure container and disposed of properly.<br><br>Any personnel experiencing fear or dread after contact with the leaves are to be monitored for any further anomalous effects and treated accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19822.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a small group of researchers attempted to collect samples from <i>SCP-19822</i>. All personnel involved experienced the effects described above and had to be removed from the area.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19822.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> So, what can you tell me about this tree?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> <i>SCP-19822</i> is a white oak tree located in Pennsylvania with leaves that cause intense fear and dread when touched by any living organism. We are unsure of the origin of these effects or how long they last after contact with the leaves, but it appears to be permanent for those affected. We have also been unable to transplant the tree, as it appears to be unable to take root outside its original location.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19822.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> A D-Class personnel was instructed to touch one of the leaves on <i>SCP-19822</i>. The subject reported feeling an intense fear and dread that lasted for approximately 10 minutes before dissipating.<br><b><br>Test 2:</b> A live rabbit was placed near <i>SCP-19822</i> and allowed to approach the tree at its own discretion. The rabbit immediately ran away from the tree after touching one of the leaves, exhibiting signs of distress for several minutes afterward.</div>
