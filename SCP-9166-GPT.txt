The cadaver should weigh no less than 40kg, and be of healthy physical condition. If 9166 becomes agitated, it should be provided with two (2) live humans from D class personnel for feeding instead. Any personnel working with 9166 are advised to avoid taking the lives of others unless there is no choice.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9166</i> is a humanoid creature resembling an elderly Chinese man. It has a height of around 2.1m, and weighs approximately 120kg. <i>SCP-9166</i> is extremely strong and resilient, able to survive multiple gunshot wounds to vital areas with little injury, despite having no defensive capabilities against its attackers other than its strength. 9166's only anomalous property appears to be its ability to manipulate space in order to move between locations at speeds of up or over 150km/h with the correct motions and gestures (See Addendum 9166-2). Although it does not require oxygen for sustenance, it does seem to experience physical discomfort when deprived of food for extended periods of time (See Addendum 9166-3). See document #9016 for more information regarding <i>SCP-9166</i>'s origins.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9166</i> was first captured by the Foundation after reports of a large, anomalous creature appearing in the ██████████ region of China. The entity was found to have taken up residence in a large cave near [DATA EXPUNGED]. <i>SCP-9166</i> appears to have made its home in the cave by entering through a natural opening and altering space within it to make living quarters. The alterations were crude at best, and did not appear sufficient for long term survival without further assistance, suggesting that it is incapable or unwilling to create more permanent structures using this method.<br><br><br>Document #9016: Interview Log 9166-1 Close document Interviewer: Dr. ████████<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9166</i><br><br><br>Foreword: First interview with 9166 following arrival of object at Site 19<br><br><Begin Log> Dr.<br> ████████ : Good afternoon 9166, how are you today?<br> <i>SCP-9166</i> : I am well thank you doctor,<br><br><h3>Addendum 9166.1 :</h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 9166.2 :</h3><br><br></div>
