<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18870 is  a website that turns people into lemons</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18870<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18870</i> is a website located at www.turnpeopleintolemons.com, which when accessed will cause any human that visits it to be transformed into a lemon. The transformation process takes approximately 3 minutes and is irreversible. Following the transformation, the individual's consciousness remains intact, though their physical form has been altered to that of a lemon in every respect except for size; individuals remain at their original height but are now composed entirely of lemon matter.<br><br>The website appears to have no other purpose than to transform humans into lemons; there are no links or other content on the site aside from an image of a large lemon with text reading <i>"Turn people into lemons!"</i> beneath it. Attempts to access the source code or modify any part of <i>SCP-18870</i> have proven unsuccessful as any changes made are reverted once the page refreshes or after several seconds have passed.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-18870</i> is to be kept offline and blocked from public access. Any attempts to access the website are to be monitored and immediately reported. All personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18870</i> must undergo psychological evaluation prior to assignment, as well as weekly evaluations thereafter.<br><br>Any individuals affected by <i>SCP-18870</i> are to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with appropriate accommodations for their new form. Personnel interacting with these individuals must wear protective gear at all times due to the acidic nature of lemon juice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18870.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a new page was added to <i>SCP-18870</i> which allows users to enter the name of an individual they wish to transform into a lemon. The page appears to have no other purpose than this, as there are no links or other content on the page aside from an image of a large lemon with text reading <i>"Enter the name of someone you want turned into a lemon!"</i> beneath it. This feature has been disabled since its discovery and is currently being investigated by personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18870</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18870.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18870</i>-1<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-18870</i>-1, formerly known as ██████ ████.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello, Mr. ████.

It seemed too good to be true so I decided to check it out and see if it actually worked… and it did! The next thing I knew, my body had changed into a lemon and here I am now.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Do you remember anything else about the website or how it worked? <br><b><br><i>SCP-18870</i>-1:</b> No, not really. It was just a plain page with an image of a lemon and some text underneath saying <i>"Turn people into lemons!"</i> That's all I can remember.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18870.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 18870-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-9072, a volunteer from the Foundation's D-Class pool.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> D-9072 was instructed to access <i>SCP-18870</i> and remain on the page for three minutes.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After three minutes had passed, D-9072 was transformed into a lemon with no apparent ill effects.
