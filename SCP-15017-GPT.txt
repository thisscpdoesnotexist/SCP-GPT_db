The probe took pictures of <i>SCP-15017</i>, which drove all of its crew insane. When they returned to Earth they were put into containment for study by Dr.█████ and his team of researchers. After studying them for 2 weeks they found out that they had been driven insane by looking at pictures taken by the probe's camera, so Dr.█████ decided to send another probe up there with cameras made from different materials in order to take new photos of <i>SCP-15017</i> so he could find out what was causing this anomaly . The new probe took photos and transmitted them back down to Earth successfully without any problems until it was about 200 meters away from <i>SCP-15017</i> when it suddenly exploded due to unknown reasons leaving no trace behind except for some pieces of metal scraps that were identified as parts from a camera lens . A few days later another space shuttle went up there with more cameras made from different materials but after taking some photos it also exploded due to unknown reasons . After this incident all attempts at sending probes up there have failed due to explosions caused by unknown reasons , although we know now what causes these explosions we still don't know how we can get past this problem without making any contact with the anomaly itself since making contact with something like this could be catastrophic if not handled correctly or if something goes wrong during research on the anomaly itself , but despite all these setbacks we are still continuing our research on <i>SCP-15017</i> because doing nothing about an anomalous object like this would be unwise .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15017.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████████, a scientist who worked on the <i>SCP-15017</i> project.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr.███████ ██████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted by Dr.██████ to find out more about <i>SCP-15017</i> and what caused it to appear in our solar system in the first place . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>What exactly is <i>SCP-15017</i>?<br><br><b>Dr.████████: </b>It's a moon that orbits around Earth, and it has an atmosphere that drives those who look at it crazy and worships it .<br><br><b>Dr.██████: </b>How did you discover this anomaly?<br><br><b>Dr.████████: </b>Well I was working with some other researchers on the <i>SCP-15017</i> project when we sent up a space probe equipped with cameras made from different materials so we could take pictures of the anomaly without making contact with it directly . We were able to successfully take some photos of <i>SCP-15017</i> but then suddenly all three cameras exploded due to unknown reasons , after this incident all attempts at sending probes up there have failed due to explosions caused by unknown reasons although we know now what causes these explosions we still don't know how we can get past this problem without making any contact with the anomaly itself since making contact with something like this could be catastrophic if not handled correctly or if something goes wrong during research on the anomaly itself but despite all these setbacks we are still continuing our research on <i>SCP-15017</i> because doing nothing about an anomalous object like this would be unwise .<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing testimony from ___________ I can say that he is telling us everything he knows about 15017 so there's no reason for me not to believe him , since he was one of those researchers who worked directly on 15017 before becoming part of my team I see no reason why he would lie about anything regarding 15016 unless his mind has been affected by looking at pictures taken by one of those probes which drove him insane , but even then I'm sure that his testimony will remain truthful as long as he doesn't go back into containment where they keep those people who have been affected by looking at pictures taken from probes sent up there before hand so they can study them more in depth without having any problems during their studies or while trying to contain them afterwards because even though they're contained safely right now they're still very dangerous and unpredictable because their minds have been driven insane due to whatever happened when they looked at certain images captured from within 15016's atmosphere which makes them act very erratic sometimes and may make them attack anyone nearby if provoked enough which is why personnel are advised not approach any person known or suspected being under its effects unless wearing proper protective gear such as [REDACTED] suits made specifically for containing people exposed too much light coming from within 15016's atmosphere .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15017.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/20██<br><br><b>Time: </b>██:██ PM - ██:██ PM<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A camera made from a piece of glass will be sent up to take photos of <i>SCP-15017</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The camera was sent up successfully and it took some photos of <i>SCP-15017</i> without any problems , but when the photos were transmitted back down to Earth they all turned out blank except for one photo that had a creepy face drawn on it with crayons . The face in the picture looked like it was frowning at the camera. After seeing this result Dr.█████ decided to send another probe up there with cameras made from different materials in order to take new pictures of <i>SCP-15017</i> so he could find out what was causing this anomaly .<br><br>Experiment #2 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/20██ <br><br><b>Time: </b>██:██ PM - ██:██ PM <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A camera made from a piece of plastic will be sent up to take photos of <i>SCP-15017</i> . <br><br><b>Results: </b>The camera was sent up successfully and it took some photos of <i>SCP-15017</i> without any problems , but when the photos were transmitted back down to Earth they all turned out blank except for one photo that had a creepy face drawn on it with crayons . The face in the picture looked like it was frowning at the camera again, which indicates that these anomalies are sentient or sapient somehow or another since they seem like they're reacting towards us taking pictures of them which is why we should never make contact with them directly because doing so could cause an XK scenario if not handled correctly or if something goes wrong during research on these anomalies themselves, which is why we should continue our research on them even though doing nothing about an anomalous object like this would be unwise since making contact with something like this could cause an XK scenario if not handled correctly or if something goes wrong during research on these anomalies themselves, which is why we should continue our research on them even though doing nothing about an anomalous object like this would be unwise since making contact with something like this could cause an XK scenario if not handled correctly or if something goes wrong during research on these anomalies themselves.</div>
