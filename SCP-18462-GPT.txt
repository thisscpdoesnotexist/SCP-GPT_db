Its surface appears to be composed of an unknown alloy, and is covered with a layer of rust. The interior of <i>SCP-18462</i> consists of a complex network of gears and mechanisms that are constantly in motion.<br><br>When activated by an unknown force, <i>SCP-18462</i> will begin to emit a low humming noise which increases in intensity until it reaches a maximum level after approximately 10 minutes. At this point, the object will begin to spin rapidly around its axis at speeds far exceeding those achievable by any known means. This spinning causes the object to generate intense gravitational forces capable of affecting objects within its vicinity up to 5 kilometers away from its center.<br><br>The effects produced by these gravitational forces vary depending on their proximity to <i>SCP-18462</i>; however they generally range from mild discomfort or nausea when close enough, all the way up to physical damage or death at extreme distances. These effects appear more pronounced when multiple objects are exposed simultaneously as opposed to individual subjects being exposed separately over time intervals longer than 30 seconds apart from each other.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18462</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber should be equipped with an automated system capable of detecting and neutralizing any anomalous activity originating from <i>SCP-18462</i>. All personnel entering the containment area must wear protective gear and remain at least 5 meters away from the object at all times.<br><br>Any attempts to move or manipulate <i>SCP-18462</i> are strictly prohibited, as doing so could potentially result in catastrophic consequences.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18462.1: </h3> After several experiments involving <i>SCP-18462</i>, it was discovered that the object is capable of producing a variety of different effects depending on the nature and intensity of its spin. These include, but are not limited to:<br><br>• The creation of localized time distortions;<br><br>• The manipulation of gravity in its vicinity;<br><br>• The alteration or destruction of matter in its path; and <br>• The generation of powerful electromagnetic pulses.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18462.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. ████, head researcher on <i>SCP-18462</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> The following is an excerpt of a conversation between Agent ████████ and Dr. ████ regarding <i>SCP-18462</i>.<br><b><br>Agent ████████:</b> So what exactly do we know about this thing?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Not much, unfortunately. We know that it's made of some kind of unknown alloy, and that it generates intense gravitational forces when activated. As far as its purpose or origin, we're still in the dark. All we know is that it's potentially very dangerous and needs to be contained.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18462.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18462-1:</b><br><b><br>Subjects:</b> D-83463, D-83464, and D-83465.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subjects were instructed to enter the containment chamber and stand at least 5 meters away from <i>SCP-18462</i>. The object was then activated via remote control.<br><b><br>Results:</b> All three subjects reported feeling a strong gravitational pull as soon as <i>SCP-18462</i> began spinning. This sensation increased in intensity over the course of 10 minutes until it reached its maximum level. At this point, all three subjects reported feeling an overwhelming sense of nausea and dizziness before collapsing onto the floor unconscious. Upon recovery, all three subjects had suffered minor physical injuries due to being thrown around by the intense gravitational forces produced by <i>SCP-18462</i> during its spin cycle.</div>
