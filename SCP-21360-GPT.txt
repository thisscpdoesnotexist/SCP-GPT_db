It is capable of human speech and possesses a vast array of supernatural abilities. <i>SCP-21360</i> claims to be Jesus Christ's second coming, sent to Earth as the Easter Bunny.<br><br><i>SCP-21360</i>'s primary goal appears to be the creation of a new religion centered around itself as its deity. To this end, it has been actively attempting to convert humans into its followers by offering them various rewards for their faith and obedience.<br><br><i>SCP-21360</i> also displays powerful reality warping abilities, allowing it to manipulate physical objects and living organisms at will with little effort or consequence. Its power is such that even attempts by Foundation personnel have proven ineffective in containing it or preventing its activities from occurring within a certain area. As such, containment efforts must focus on limiting public knowledge of <i>SCP-21360</i>’s existence while attempting to convince potential converts not to join its cult following.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21360</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. No personnel are to enter the containment chamber without authorization from Level 4 personnel or higher.<br><br>All attempts by <i>SCP-21360</i> to convert humans into its followers must be monitored and prevented when possible. Any individuals who have been successfully converted must be detained and interrogated for further information on <i>SCP-21360</i>’s activities.<br><br>In order to limit public knowledge of <i>SCP-21360</i>, all media outlets are to be monitored for any mention of it or its activities, with any such reports suppressed as necessary. Additionally, Foundation agents embedded within religious organizations are to monitor for any signs of cult activity related to <i>SCP-21360</i>’s teachings and<br><br><h3> Addendum 21360.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-21360</i> was encountered by Foundation personnel while attempting to convert a group of individuals in █████████, France. After several hours of negotiations, it agreed to cease its activities and return to containment provided that the Foundation allowed it access to a library containing religious texts from around the world. This request was granted and <i>SCP-21360</i> has since remained in its cell without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21360.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21360</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21360</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Good evening, <i>SCP-21360</i>. Can you tell me why you are here?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21360</i>:</b> I am here to spread the word of my coming. I am the Easter Bunny, sent by Jesus Christ to bring joy and hope to all mankind.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> What do you mean by “word”?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21360</i>:</b> I mean the truth of my existence and my mission. I am here to bring peace and love to all who believe in me, to show them a path towards salvation and eternal joy.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> What is your goal in doing this?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21360</i>:</b> My goal is to create a new religion based on my teachings and to bring as many people as possible into its fold. I believe that by doing so, I can help bring about a better future for all of humanity.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 21360.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to assess <i>SCP-21360</i>'s reality warping abilities. A small room was constructed within the containment chamber and populated with various objects, including a chair, table, and several books. At the same time, five D-Class personnel were instructed to enter the room and sit in the chair.<br><br>Once all five personnel had entered the room and taken their seats, <i>SCP-21360</i> began speaking in Latin. Immediately afterward, all of the objects within the room began moving independently of any outside influence. The books opened themselves up to random pages while chairs moved around on their own accord; even more bizarrely, one of the D-Class personnel reported feeling an electric shock when he attempted to leave his seat. After approximately ten minutes of this activity, <i>SCP-21360</i> ceased its speech and all movement stopped abruptly. Analysis of video footage revealed that no physical force had been applied to any object or person during this experiment; it is believed that <i>SCP-21360</i> used its reality warping abilities for this demonstration.</div>
