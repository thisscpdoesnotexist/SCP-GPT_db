Testing involving <i>SCP-16880</i> is currently suspended due to lack of proper equipment needed for testing involving substances used in making bath bombs along with an insufficient amount test subjects willing<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16880</i> is a pack of 12 bathbombs, each with a different color. When dropped into water, <i>SCP-16880</i> will cause the affected water to change its state into one of the following:<br><br>Blue - The affected water will become extremely cold.<br><br>Green - The affected water will become extremely hot.<br><br>Yellow - The affected water will be filled with bubbles that are impossible to pop, and the affected person's skin will begin to feel as if it were on fire. This effect lasts for 1 minute before disappearing. Afterwards, the person's skin is covered in small burns that disappear after 2 hours. If any part of this effect makes contact with another person (such as when they try to pop a bubble), they also become effected by it until 1 minute passes without contact between them and any other part of the effect (including other people). This can cause multiple people to be effected by this at once, although only one person can be burned at once by this effect (the first burn happening on their skin). After 2 hours have passed without contact between them and any other part of the effect (including other people), all burns disappear from both people involved in this event . If not treated within 5 minutes , these burns turn into scars . These scars are permanent , but do not hinder movement or function like normal scarring does . These scars do not go away under any circumstances . They cannot even be removed through surgery or healing magic . It is unknown how these scars appear on those who have been burnt by <i>SCP-16880</i>'s Yellow Effect in such a short time period , considering how long it takes normal scarring to appear when caused by similar means . It should also be noted that there has been no evidence found showing how these effects occur or why they act differently than normal scarring would act under similar circumstances. There has been no evidence found showing how <i>SCP-16880</i> causes its effects either; however, it is believed that <i>SCP-16880</i> uses some sort of anomalous means for its effects instead of using chemical reactions like most bath bombs do for their colors' respective temperatures' effects since there has been no chemical reaction detected from testing involving <i>SCP-16880</i> and chemicals used as components for bath bombs in order to determine what causes its anomalous properties; however, more testing needs done before we can confirm whether or not this theory is correct due to lack of proper equipment needed for testing involving substances used in making bath bombs along with an insufficient amount test subjects willing<br><br><h3>Addendum 16880.2 : </h3>Interview with ~<s><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> </s>~ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, ~<s>. I hope you're ready to tell us about the bath bombs you made for Dr. Wondertainment's company? </s>~: Yeah, sure thing! They were awesome and all! But I'm not saying how they work though… That's top secret stuff! And it ain't right to spill secrets like that without permission from the guy who told me 'em in the first place, y'know? [Dr. ██████ nods and writes this down] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then… Can you describe what happened when one of your bath bombs were dropped into water? [Subject begins to nod] ~~~: Well yeah, sure thing doc! When a bomb is dropped into water that has been turned into a different state by one of my bombs, then it'll change back to its original state after a certain amount of time passes without contact between any part of the effect (including other people) and any other part of the effect (including other people). If someone is burnt by my Yellow Effect before 2 hours pass without contact between them and any other part of the effect (including other people), then they become scarred for life . It's totally awesome seeing someone get burnt like that in such a short time period! [Dr. ██████ writes this down as well] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So these effects are permanent regardless if they're treated or not?

After the time had passed, he was instructed to remove it from the water and place it on a table in front of him. He was then told to observe <i>SCP-16880</i>'s effects while researchers observed his skin's condition through a camera set up in the room. The results are as follows:<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-16880</i>'s Blue Effect activated when dropped into the vat of water, causing it to become extremely cold . When D - 9042 removed SCP - 16880 from the vat , he complained about how cold it felt . Upon placing SCP - 16880 onto the table , its Green Effect activated . This caused small flames to appear around D - 9042 ' s skin where ever there were bubbles formed by this effect . All flames disappeared after 1 minute without contact between them and any other part of this effect ( including other people). Afterwards , all burns left behind by these flames turned into scars that were permanent like normal scarring would be under similar circumstances ; however, these scars did not hinder movement or function like normal scarring does since they were still considered burns at this point in time (however they did not go away under any circumstances). These scars remained on his skin until 5 minutes had passed without contact between them and any other part of this effect (including other people), at which point they turned into normal scars that went away after 2 hours had passed without contact between them and any other part of this effect (including other people). It should also be noted that there has been no evidence found showing how these effects occur or why they act differently than normal scarring would act under similar circumstances; however, more testing needs done before we can confirm whether or not this theory is correct due to lack of proper equipment needed for testing involving substances used in making bath bombs along with an insufficient amount test subjects willing.<br><br>Note from Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>I'm starting to think we need better equipment for testing involving substances used in making bath bombs along with an insufficient amount test subjects willing if we're going get anywhere with figuring out how these effects are occurring along with what causes its anomalous properties; however, more testing needs done before we can confirm whether or not this theory is correct due to lack of proper equipment needed for testing involving substances used in making bath bombs along with an insufficient amount test subjects willing Experiment Log: Subject(s): D - 8241 , A female aged 17 years old who has suffered severe depression since she was 12 years old due partially because her parents died when she was 3 years old after being killed by one another during an argument over custody issues regarding her; she has also attempted suicide twice prior during times when she felt particularly depressed because she believed life wasn't worth living anymore due partially because her depression made her feel as if nothing mattered anymore since everything bad happened already so why bother doing anything else? She also suffers from severe insomnia which makes everyday feel like hell since even though you don't have nightmares about stuff you're afraid will happen when you fall asleep at night during your sleep cycle but dreams about stuff you wish would happen instead don't seem real enough either way so why bother dreaming at all? Also note that despite having suicidal thoughts occasionally throughout her life prior to coming here just because some days life just seems too much trouble sometimes plus some days things just feel pointless anyway so what's even the point anyway?, she never attempted suicide again once admitted into Foundation custody nor did anyone else report ever seeing signs indicating suicidal behavior within her behavior patterns either past present nor future nor within our information database records on said individual either past present nor future indicating previous attempts occurred but failed therefore rendering said individual useless for further experiments regarding such matters unless approved beforehand by both Site Director ████ & Ethics Committee Chairman ████ first via written request accompanied by good reason(s) explaining why said individual should be allowed back onto active duty status prior considering current mental state & physical health conditions <br><br><b>NOTE: </b>This experiment will use [REDACTED] as its control substance instead considering how [REDACTED] is currently unavailable for use right now considering recent events therefore requiring us do do more tests using [REDACTED] once available again instead</div>
