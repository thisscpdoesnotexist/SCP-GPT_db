No personnel are allowed to use <i>SCP-9719</i> without O5 approval.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9719</i> is a black backpack with an endless internal volume. It was discovered in █████████, ████████, after reports of a man who had been carrying it around for several days and had not run out of space to carry things.<br><br>When the object is being used by someone, all items placed inside will disappear from the outside world as long as they are within <i>SCP-9719</i>'s interior. The objects will continue to exist inside <i>SCP-9719</i> until removed from it by its user or until the user dies. If another person attempts to place an item in <i>SCP-9719</i> while it is being used by someone else, that person will experience a brief period of unconsciousness before regaining consciousness again with no memory of what happened during their unconsciousness (see Addendum 9719-2).<br><br><i>SCP-9719</i> can be used to store any type of object without affecting its anomalous properties. Attempts to put living creatures into <i>SCP-9719</i> have failed due to their inability to fit through its opening (see Experiment Log 9719). When multiple objects are placed inside simultaneously, they appear arranged in order from smallest dimensions first; however, if one or more objects are removed before others are added back into the backpack then those remaining rearrange themselves randomly upon reinsertion (see Experiment Log 9719). This effect does not occur when placing only one object at a time into <i>SCP-9791</i>; instead all other items previously stored within it will disappear and be replaced with that single item. Objects removed from <i>SCP-9791</i> do not return when another object replaces them; however they reappear if all objects currently stored within are removed at once and then new ones put back in afterwards (See Experiment Log 9711). The wearer has full control over which items come out first when removing multiple items at once using this method; however this does not seem possible when removing only one item at a time (See Experiment Log 9709). There appears no limit on how many times an individual can place something into or remove something from SCP -9791 . However if too many different types of objects have been placed inside simultaneously then some may become impossible for anyone but the owner/original creator(s) of those particular types of objects to retrieve again . See Addendum 9710 for more details about retrieving specific types of nonliving materials from within 9791 . See Addendum 9709 for details about retrieving living creatures and human beings specifically .<br><br></div>
