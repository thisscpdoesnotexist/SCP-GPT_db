The problem is he mistakes honey with human blood.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9101</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> █ 3 cm of honey should be placed in <i>SCP-9101</i>'s containment chamber at all times.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9101</i> is a bear that loves honey. He will attack anyone who walks by his containment chamber if he does not have any honey.<br><br><i>SCP-9101</i> was discovered in ██████, Canada after reports of a bear attacking people and drinking their blood. <i>SCP-9101</i> was brought in for questioning and it revealed that he was thirsty because of the <i>"honey"</i> they had given him which turned out to be human blood. The Foundation then took over control of the town <i>SCP-9101</i> had been living in and set up a new population under the guise of being RCMP officers from ██████, Canada. The citizens were given amnesiacs before leaving so they would forget about what happened to them when <i>SCP-9101</i> attacked them/their friends/family members etcetera…<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9101</i> was sent to the nearest town and told to attack anyone who came near his containment chamber.<br><br><br><i>SCP-9101</i>: Honey pleeeease! (beginning to cry) Dr.<br> ███: I'm sorry but we can't give you any honey right now because we need it for other SCPs.<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>: But what am I supposed to do without any honey? Dr.<br> ███: Try eating something else besides honey like humans for example (shoots a man behind <i>SCP-9101</i>).<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>: Ohhh… I didn't know that people tasted good! (laughs) This is gonna be fun!<br><br><h3>Addendum 9101.1 :</h3><br><br>Not sure if this is a joke or not but here it goes…<br><br><br><i>SCP-9101</i>: Honey? Dr.<br> ███: No…<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>: I want honey! Dr.<br> ███: What about people?<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>: People? They're full of honey aren't they? Dr.<br> ███: Yes but they also taste bad.<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>:(laughs) You are so funny doctor!<br><br><h3>Addendum 9101.2 :</h3><br><br>Testing of <i>SCP-9101</i> will continue until further notice.<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9101</i> Interviewer: Dr.<br> ███ Foreword: The following interview was conducted after Doctor ███ gave honey to <i>SCP-9101</i> as a reward for his cooperation. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ███: So what do you think about that new guy?<br> <i>SCP-9101</i>:(laughs) He tastes good! Dr.<br> ███: I see… So can you tell me a bit more about him? How did you meet him and why did he come here?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9101</i>:(laughs) I met him when he walked by my containment chamber and told me his name was <i>"John Smith"</i>. And then I said <i>"Hi, my name is John Smith too!"</i>. He laughed for some reason and started walking away but then turned around again and asked if there were any other John Smith's in the town (there aren't). When I told him no he proceeded to enter my containment chamber (he didn't know it was locked at the time because the lock only came out after 5 minutes had passed). After that we talked for like an hour or so about how much we loved honey before he asked if there were any bears like us in our town (that's when I knew what this freak actually was). Then he tried to fight me but failed miserably… Even though i'm much bigger than him, at least in height xD After that all hell broke loose</div>
