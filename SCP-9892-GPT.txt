Access to <i>SCP-9892</i> is strictly forbidden unless approved by Level 3 or higher personnel and only for testing purposes .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9892</i> is a small (2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm) cube constructed of a material that has yet to be identified by the Foundation. It has been shown to be indestructible, and is capable of emitting a powerful electromagnetic field when activated. <i>SCP-9892</i>'s anomalous properties become apparent when it is placed within 10 meters of any human being for more than 5 minutes, at which point the subject will begin to feel an overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom, as well as several other emotions that vary from person to person in intensity and effect depending on their personality .<br><br>Subjects report feeling happy, sad, angry or confused before becoming extremely depressed with thoughts such as <i>"What's the point in living?"</i>, <i>"I'm not good enough"</i>, or <i>"I don't belong here"</i>. The emotions felt by subjects are reported to be similar in nature to those felt during depressive episodes caused by mental illness such as depression or anxiety disorders. Subjects have also been noted experiencing symptoms similar to those experienced during panic attacks caused by anxiety disorders such as shortness of breath , rapid heartbeat , nausea , sweating , trembling hands , numbness/tingling sensations in limbs and chest pain .<br><br>After 30 minutes exposed <i>SCP-9892</i> subjects will begin experiencing auditory hallucinations consisting mainly of incoherent whispering voices that often attempt to convince them into committing suicide via violent means such as hanging themselves or jumping off buildings . After 60 minutes exposed subjects will experience violent muscle spasms accompanied by feelings of extreme paranoia where they believe someone is trying kill them through various methods including poisoning their food or injecting them with poison while they sleep . This can last up until 3 hours after exposure whereupon all physical symptoms disappear but subjects continue reporting auditory hallucinations for up until 8 hours after exposure before finally returning back into normalcy . Once removed from <i>SCP-9892</i>'s presence these symptoms do not return even if subject is reexposed later on down the line which suggests that there may be some sort of immunity acquired over time; however this theory has yet been proven correct due lack amount research done on this matter thus far .<br><br><i>SCP-9892</i> was recovered from [REDACTED] High School located in ██████ California after reports were sent out about students suffering from mass hysteria causing many teachers and students alike present at school at time time affected resulting in ██ casualties before school was closed down indefinitely due inability staff keep order among student body who were attempting commit mass suicide via jumping off nearby<br><br><h3>Addendum 9892.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ██████, a student who was present at [REDACTED] High School during the incident.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Subject was one of the few students who were not affected by <i>SCP-9892</i>'s anomalous properties during Incident 9892-1. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello Mr.████, I'm going to be asking you some questions about what happened at school today and your experience with <i>SCP-9892</i> .
