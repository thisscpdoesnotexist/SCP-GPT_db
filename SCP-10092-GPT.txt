All personnel who have consumed any item produced by ████ or one of its subsidiaries are required to submit themselves for testing on a biweekly basis in order to ensure that they have not been affected by <i>SCP-10092</i>'s cognitohazardous properties.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10092</i> is a cognitohazardous entity which affects the minds of individuals who have consumed any item produced by the fast food chain known as ████, or any of its subsidiaries. <i>SCP-10092</i> will manifest in the mind of an affected individual as a large, humanoid caricature with elongated arms and legs. <i>SCP-10092</i> has been observed to possess various anomalous properties in order to remain undetected by those around it, including:<br><br>The ability to change its shape and size at will.<br><br>The ability to move silently while not being observed by others.<br><br>The ability to manipulate objects within a 15 meter radius without directly touching them.<br><br><i>SCP-10092</i> has been seen using these abilities in order to prey upon individuals affected by <i>SCP-10092</i>'s cognitohazardous properties; generally targeting children under the age of 12, but occasionally targeting adults if no suitable children are available nearby. When an individual is targeted for attack, <i>SCP-10092</i> will wait until they are alone before approaching them from behind and wrapping one arm around their neck while placing their other hand over their mouth (in cases where they were able to approach said individual from behind). After this occurs, <i>SCP-10092</i> will begin whispering into the ear of said individual before forcibly inserting an object into their mouth; usually in the form of small pieces or parts taken from previously consumed items produced by ████ or one of its subsidiaries (see Addendum 10092A). Once this occurs, <i>SCP-10092</i> will release said individual before walking away at a casual pace; leaving victims confused but otherwise unharmed physically speaking. However upon regaining consciousness after being attacked by <i>SCP-10092</i> , victims often report feelings of extreme hunger no matter how much they have already eaten that day; even if it was only minutes prior . These feelings persist for approximately 1 month after initial exposure , after which time victims report feeling full despite having only consumed small amounts food throughout each day . This effect eventually subsides completely once all portions taken from previous consumption have been fully digested . The majority ( 98% )of subjects exposed to these effects do not seek medical attention due [REDACTED] . The remaining 2% do so out fear that something may be wrong with them physically speaking , though these fears are unfounded as testing reveals nothing abnormal about subjects' bodies except for slight weight loss ; most likely caused due [DATA EXPUNGED] .

After consuming said meal, subject was placed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██ and monitored for signs of <i>SCP-10092</i>'s anomalous properties. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Approximately 1 hour after consuming the aforementioned meal, D-3979 began showing symptoms similar to those experienced by other subjects exposed to <i>SCP-10092</i>'s cognitohazardous properties; specifically feelings of extreme hunger despite having just eaten . Approximately 5 minutes later, <i>SCP-10092</i> manifested within the cell and immediately approached D-3979 from behind before wrapping its arms around his neck and placing its hand over his mouth; all while whispering into his ear . After this occurred, <i>SCP-10092</i> forcibly inserted several small pieces of food into D - 3979 's mouth before releasing him and walking away at a casual pace as it had done with previous victims. Results were consistent with other instances where individuals have been exposed to SCP - 10092 's cognitohazardous properties . Test #: 10092 - 2<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Researcher Dr. A█████ , a 45 year old Caucasian female who has never consumed any item produced by ████ or one of its subsidiaries prior to experimentation. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to consume one (1) Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal produced by ████ in order determine if any anomalous effects occur when an individual who has not previously consumed items produced by ████ or one of its subsidiaries is exposed to them for the first time . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Approximately 1 hour after consuming the aforementioned meal , Researcher Dr . A█████ began showing symptoms similar to those experienced by other subjects exposed to SCP - 10092 ' s cognitohazardous properties ; specifically feelings of extreme hunger despite having just eaten approximately 10 minutes prior . Approximately 5 minutes later , SCP - 100 92 manifested within the cell and immediately approached Researcher Dr . A█████ from behind before wrapping its arms around her neck while placing its hand over her mouth ; all while whispering into her ear as it had done during previous experiments involving exposure through consumption . After this occurred , SC P - 1 009 2 forcibly inserted several small pieces of food into R ese archer Dr A████' s mouth before releasing her and walking away at a casual pace as it had done during previous experiments involving exposure through consumption . Results were consistent with other instances where individuals have been exposed t o S C P - 10 0 9 2' s c o g n i t o h a za rdou s p ro p e rt i e s through consumption only ; no additional anomalous effects were observed beyond those caused directly via said consumption alone throughout testing period which lasted approximately 3 hours in total following initial exposure (see Addendum 100921). Note From Dr <br><br><b>M████████: </b>This suggests that there is no risk associated with accidentally ingesting these foods provided you do not become aware that they are tainted beforehand; however I would advise against doing so regardless due [REDACTED]<br><br></div>
