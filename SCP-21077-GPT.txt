<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21077 is  an STI that turns you into a walrus</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21077<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21077</i> is an infectious sexually transmitted infection (STI) that causes the infected individual to slowly transform into a walrus. The transformation begins with the growth of fur over the body, followed by a gradual increase in size and weight, and eventually full metamorphosis into a walrus.<br><br>The infection can be spread through any form of sexual contact, including oral sex or anal sex. It is unknown how long it takes for symptoms to manifest after initial exposure; however, it has been observed that the transformation progresses rapidly once it has begun.<br><br>Once fully transformed, <i>SCP-21077</i> will exhibit typical behavior associated with walruses in their natural environment; however they are capable of understanding human language and communicating with humans using vocalizations similar to those used by other species of marine mammals. Additionally, they possess some degree of intelligence which allows them to understand basic commands given in English or other languages spoken by humans.<br><br>Currently there is no known cure for <i>SCP-21077</i>; however research is ongoing in order to find one before more individuals become affected by this anomalous STI.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Individuals infected with <i>SCP-21077</i> are to be contained in a standard aquatic containment tank, equipped with appropriate filtration and heating systems. The tank should also be large enough to accommodate the full transformation of the individual into a walrus.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of <i>SCP-21077</i>, all individuals who have come into contact with an infected person must be monitored for signs of infection and tested regularly for any changes in their physiology or behavior. Any individuals found to have been exposed must immediately be quarantined until it can be determined whether or not they are infected.<br><br>Any attempts at communication between humans and <i>SCP-21077</i> instances must only take place under the supervision of personnel trained in dealing with anomalous organisms<br><br><h3> Addendum 21077.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, an infected individual was discovered in a small fishing village near the coast of [REDACTED]. The individual had been living there for approximately two months and had been engaging in sexual activities with multiple partners during that time. All individuals who had come into contact with the infected person were tested and found to be free of infection; however, all individuals have since been placed under observation as a precaution.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21077.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21077</i>-1<br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel at Site-██ conducted an interview with <i>SCP-21077</i> instance designated as <i>SCP-21077</i>-1. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-21077</i>-1. How are you feeling today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21077</i>-1:</b> [Vocalizations similar to those of a walrus]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> I'm sorry, can you please try to communicate in English? Do you understand what I'm saying? <br>Yes. [Walrus vocalizations]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Alright. Can you tell me how long ago you were infected with <i>SCP-21077</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21077</i>-1:</b> About two months ago. [Walrus vocalizations]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you remember how you were infected?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21077</i>-1:</b> Yes. I had unprotected sex with someone who was already infected. [Walrus vocalizations]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any advice for people who may be at risk of becoming infected?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21077</i>-1:</b> Yes. Always practice safe sex and get tested regularly. [Walrus vocalizations]<br><br><h3> Addendum 21077.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-2345, a male human subject with no prior history of infection.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-21077</i> via unprotected sexual contact with an infected individual. Subject was monitored for signs of infection and tested regularly for any changes in their physiology or behavior. <br><b>Results:</b> After two weeks, the subject began exhibiting symptoms associated with <i>SCP-21077</i>; within three months, the transformation into a walrus had been completed. The walrus instance exhibited typical behavior associated with its species and displayed basic understanding of English language commands given by personnel.</div>
