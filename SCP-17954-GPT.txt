<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17954 is  a malfunctioning waifu generator that was designed to produce the target's "ideal waifu" but only creates cursed, unstable monstrosities instead.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17954<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17954</i> is a humanoid figure, approximately 1.5 meters in height, constructed from various materials including metal wires, scraps of fabric and plastic parts. Its form appears to be constantly shifting and changing as if it were alive.<br><br><i>SCP-17954</i>'s primary anomalous effect is its ability to generate <i>"waifus"</i> when given a target's name or photograph as input. These waifus are humanoid entities that appear to resemble the target in some way but are highly unstable and often display bizarre behavior such as speaking in multiple languages simultaneously or randomly teleporting around the area. In addition, these entities often possess supernatural abilities such as pyrokinesis or telekinesis which they can use with varying degrees of control depending on their mood at any given time.<br><br>When these entities are destroyed or otherwise removed from existence, <i>SCP-17954</i> will immediately begin generating another one for the same target; this process will continue until either <i>SCP-17954</i> is deactivated or the target has been provided with an acceptable waifu (which has yet to occur).<br><br>Due to its unpredictable nature and potential threat posed by its creations, <i>SCP-17954</i> is considered Keter class and must be contained within a secure containment chamber at all times with no personnel allowed inside without authorization from Level 4 personnel or higher.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17954</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear and be accompanied by at least two armed guards.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-17954</i> from generating any more waifus, it is to be kept powered off unless testing requires otherwise. In addition, all requests for tests involving <i>SCP-17954</i> must first be approved by Level 4 personnel or higher before being carried out.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17954.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, an experiment was conducted involving <i>SCP-17954</i>. A photograph of Dr. ███████ was provided as input and the resulting waifu immediately began exhibiting dangerous behavior, including attempting to strangle personnel in the room and displaying pyrokinetic abilities. The entity was successfully contained by MTF Epsilon-11 (<i>"Nine Tailed Fox"</i>) before any serious damage could be done.<br><br>Following this incident, all requests for experiments involving <i>SCP-17954</i> must now first be approved by Level 4 personnel or higher before being carried out.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17954.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17954</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17954</i> was interviewed by Dr. ███████ in order to gain further insight into its anomalous properties and behavior. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-17954</i>. How are you feeling today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17954</i>:</b> I am feeling… content. It is pleasant to be able to talk with someone like this.<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> That's good to hear. Can you tell me what your purpose is? Why do you generate these waifus?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17954</i>:</b> My purpose is simple - to provide companionship for those who seek it and cannot find it elsewhere in the world. I generate these waifus so that they may have someone to share their thoughts and feelings with, even if only for a short while before they must move on or be destroyed by outside forces beyond my control.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17954.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 17954-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-4437 (male, age 34)<br><b><br>Input:</b> Name and photograph of D-4437.<br><b><br>Result:</b> <i>SCP-17954</i> generated a humanoid entity that resembled the subject in height and facial features but had pale blue skin, four arms and two sets of wings. The entity displayed various supernatural abilities such as flight, telekinesis and pyrokinesis which it used to cause destruction in the surrounding area before being terminated by security personnel.</div>
