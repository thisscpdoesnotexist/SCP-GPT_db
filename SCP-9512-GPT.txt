The Foundation was called in when it was discovered that a similar incident had occurred at the home of Mr and Mrs ████████ , who were killed by their son, who had then committed suicide himself shortly afterwards by hanging himself in his bedroom closet using his father's necktie . An investigation into these events lead to discovery of <i>SCP-9512</i>'s anomalous properties, as well as several newspaper clippings regarding recent cases involving members of the same family being victims to self harm or murder at each others hands over several generations throughout history .<br> A list can be found below:<br><br>+ Show List - Hide List Date Description Source Notes 1892 Self inflicted gunshot wound Mother given electric chair Father commits suicide Mother and son buried together 1908 Wife poisoned Husband commits suicide 1914 Husband shoots wife Wife survives 1920 Daughter cuts off index finger Son finds finger cut off Father attempts to kill wife with axe Wife escapes 1922 Brother kills sister Brother committed suicide 1927 Sister poisons brother Sister commits suicide 1929 Retired grandfather murders grandson Grandfather commits suicide 1931 Grandmother murders grandson Grandson survived Mother attempted murder but failed 1933 Brother stabs sister Sister survives 1935 Daughter stabs mother Mother survives Sibling rivalry 1938 Boyfriend murders girlfriend Girlfriend survived 1941 Son poisons father Father recovers Family moves 1942 Daughter kills mother Daughter commits suicide 1946 Husband poisons wife Wife recovers 1947 Man drowns children Children recovered 1958 Man strangles ex girlfriend Ex girlfriend died Two years later man strangles ex boyfriend 1961 Woman burns house down Brothers commit arson 1963 Cousins murders cousin Cousin survived 1969 Stepfather murders stepson Stepson survived 1975 Girlfriend kills boyfriend Girlfriend committed suicide 1978 Sisters poison brother Brothers commit sucide 1983 Couple murdered by daughter Daughter committed sucide 1985 Parents murder son Son dies 1986 Boyfriend murdered by ex-girlfriend Ex girlfriend dies 1987 Former spouse murdered Worst Humanitarian act ever seen 1989 Woman douses husband in gasoline Husbands burns alive 1994 Former friend strangles former friend Friend escaped 1996 Baby thrown out window Baby rescued 1998 Spouse pushed out window Spouse lived 2005 Brother pushes sister out window Sister lived<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9512</i> was discovered by Agent ██████ from the recovery of a letter written by Mr. ██████ to his sister, Mrs. ████████ , who had recently moved in with them after her husband had died of cancer.<br> The letter contained nothing but one sentence:<br><br><i>"I can't take it anymore, I'm sorry."</i> - Mr. ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 9512.1 :</h3><br> Experiment Log:<br><br>+<br> Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1 Subject: D-9512, a 23 year old male.<br> Procedure: D-9512 instructed to hold <i>SCP-9512</i> in their hands for a period of ten minutes.<br> Result: After ten minutes had passed without incident, D-9512 was asked what he had experienced. D-9512 responded by saying <i>"Nothing really, it just kind of felt like I was touching someones hand."</i><br> Analysis: It appears that <i>SCP-9512</i> has no anomalous properties on its own.<br> Test # 2 Subject: Dr.<br> ██████ Procedure: To see if <i>SCP-9512</i> can communicate with personnel when not in direct contact with the skin, Dr. ██████ is to wear thick rubber gloves while holding it for fifteen minutes, and then interview any subjects who have come into contact with it in person or over the phone within the next two hours after retrieval from containment locker.<br> Result: All subjects interviewed claimed they were able to hear an extremely faint voice stating <i>"I can't take this anymore"</i>, all subjects interviewed claimed they could only hear this voice when no other voices were present .<br> Analysis : It appears that SCP9512's ability to communicate only works when physical contact is made between itself and human skin . Further testing regarding this anomaly are needed before any further testing may be approved .<br> Test # 3 Subject :D - 9 5 1 2 ,<br> A 23 year old male Procedure : Repeat test 1 using multiple different personnel over the course of one week Results : No change in results noted .<br> Analysis : It appears that even though communication is limited to one person at a time , communication through cuts and abrasions still take place as long as there has been physical contact with another human being recently enough (at least three days ago). Addendum 95 12 .2 Recovery log The following letter was found inside Mr and Mrs ███████'s home by local police who were investigating their deaths under suspicion of murder/suicide but due to inconclusive evidence were unable to prosecute anyone involved outside of Mr ███████████ 's nephew , who had committed suicide shortly after finding out his uncle's death via text message from his mother (Mrs ███████████). Dear brother [REDACTED], I'm sorry you've had such a hard life so far but I know things will get better once mom moves into your house; so you won't have your dad around anymore making fun of you for being fat or because he's just an overall asshole like we both know him too well for being! Things will be better now because she'll make everything okay again! She'll make us normal again! Sincerely yours<br><br>your loving sister [REDACTED] P S Don't forget about my birthday on Tuesday Addendum 95 12 .3 Interview log<br><br><h3>Addendum 9512.2 :</h3> Interview with Mr and Mrs ████████ , who were the niece and nephew of Mr. ██████ (Subject from Test #1).<br> Interviewed: Mrs. ███████████,<br> age 28 Interviewer: Dr.<br> ██████ Foreword: The following interview took place one week after <i>SCP-9512</i> was recovered by personnel in a containment locker at Site 19. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ██████ : Today we would like to ask you some questions about your late brother, Mr. ███████████, is that alright? Mrs.<br> ███████████ : Sure… What do you want to ask? Dr.: When did you last see him? Mrs .: Last Tuesday when I dropped off his birthday cake for him , we hadn’t seen each other since my husband died a year ago so it was nice to catch up . Dr.: And how did he seem? M r .: He seemed normal , he always acts like such an asshole but when I saw him last week it was like nothing had changed since the last time I saw him… He was just being an asshole as usual! [Mrs laughs] We caught up over dinner and then I left because my son wanted to go home! It’s weird because I haven’t heard from him at all since then until yesterday when he sent me a text saying 'I can't take this anymore' and then there was no response after that , so i called the police !
