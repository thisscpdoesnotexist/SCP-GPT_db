The officer then proceeded to shoot himself in the head with his service weapon, which was later determined to be done by order of <i>SCP-15228</i> itself via telepathy. A team consisting of Drs. ██████ and ████ were sent out to retrieve <i>SCP-15228</i> after this incident occurred and they successfully did so without any major complications occurring while doing so.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15228.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-15228</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to determine the origin of <i>SCP-15228</i> and how it came to be sentient. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-15228</i>, my name is Doctor ██████. I'd like to ask you a few questions about yourself if that's alright with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15228</i>: </b>Go ahead Doc, I don't mind answering your questions at all. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then, first question is what are your origins? Where did you come from? <i>SCP-15228</i> laughs uncontrollably for a few seconds before responding back to the doctor in an amused tone of voice. <br><br><b><i>SCP-15228</i>: </b>You really want to know where I came from huh? Well…I'll tell ya! See this hat used to belong to this guy named Steve Johnson who worked as a janitor at Site-[REDACTED] and one day he decided that he wanted something more out of life than just cleaning up after people so he asked me for help in getting what he wanted and well…here we are today! Drs. ██████ and ████ both appear unamused by the story given by 15228 which is shown on their faces as they stare blankly at it while writing notes down on their clipboards about its response given during the interview . Drs. <br><br><b>██████: </b>Very well then, next question; why do you have these abilities that allow you control over other people's actions? What makes them possible exactly? (<i>SCP-1528</i> remains silent for several seconds before responding back): Very well then, next question; why do you have these abilities that allowcontrol over other people's actions? What makes them possible exactly? (<i>SCP-1528</i> remains silent for several seconds before responding back) Please answer the question 1528! If not we will be forced t o terminate thi s intervie w right now ! It responds again after being threatened by one of the doctors present during its interview . SCP - 15 28: Hey man , jus t calm down alright ? There's no need t o get violent here ! Anyway , seein g as y'all seem pretty interested in how my powers work , I'll tell ya ! The reason why my powers work is because when Steve put his head inside me , it made him go insane . He started hearing voices telling him things like <i>"Put your head inside me"</i> or <i>"You should kill yourself"</i> or even <i>"Go kill those cops!"</i> After hearing some of these voices enough times , his brain started believing them and eventually turned him into an insane killer who killed everyone around him without mercy or remorse until finally killing himself with his service weapon which was later found lying next t o hi m when they recovered my body from where they found hi m dead outside Site-[REDACTED]. That was pretty much how everything happened but hey , if y'all want anymore details just ask away okay ? Those doctors look unamused by its response once again but decide not say anything else about it since there isn't any point in doing so since it has already answered all their questions anyways . They proceed onto asking another question instead since there isn't any need in wasting time doing so when nothing else needs saying anyways . Drs . + + +: Alright then…next ques tion ; can yo u please tell us what yo u plan on doing wi th us here ? We're not going anywhere anytime soon so feel free t o just take your time answering our questions whenever y'all are ready please… (SCP - 15 28 remain s silent fo r several second s before respond ing ): Alright then…next ques tion ; can yo u please tell us what yo u plan on doing wi th us here ? We're not going anywhere anytime soon so feel free t o just take your time answering our questions whenever y'all are ready please… (SCP - 15 28 remain s silent fo r several second s before respond ing ) Okay Docs …I guess I'll start off by saying this; don't worry guys because I'm not planning on hurting either one of ya 'll or anyone else for tha matter! In fact, let me prove myself right now by putting this hat down over here beside me okay guys ? The two doctors look at each other briefly but agree upon letting it put itself<br><br><h3>Addendum 15228.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15228-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15228-1 (Male, 36)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15228-1 was instructed to put on <i>SCP-15228</i>. After doing so, he was instructed to do a series of tests that would determine the effects of <i>SCP-15228</i>. He was then told to take off <i>SCP-15228</i> and put it back in its containment locker.<br><br><b>Results: </b>While wearing <i>SCP-15228</i>, D-15228 reported hearing voices in his head telling him that they were going to kill him and make it look like a suicide. He then proceeded to shoot himself with his service weapon after removing <i>SCP-15228</i> from his head. The bullet entered through the left temple and exited through the right one, killing D-[DATA EXPUNGED]. Autopsy report showed that no traces of [DATA EXPUNGED] were found inside D-[DATA EXPUNGED]'s body after death occurred.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It is safe to say that any individual who wears this hat will be killed by an instance of SCP-[REDACTED]. It is also safe to say that these instances are capable of telepathy as well as mind control over individuals who wear them or are within close proximity of them while they wear them (See Experiment 1528). These instances seem incapable of moving away from their host bodies if they have one attached themselves onto it or if they are too far away from said host body for whatever reason(see Experiment 1528). This can be explained by the fact that these entities seem incapable of leaving their hosts willingly due to how much mental trauma occurs when attempting this action(see Experiment 1528).</div>
