<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17520 is  a feral catgirl colony</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17520<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17520</i> is a colony of feral catgirls, located in a rural area near ████████, Oregon. The colony consists of approximately fifty individuals ranging in age from newborns to adults. All members are female and possess various feline features such as ears, tails, whiskers and fur.<br><br>The catgirls exhibit typical behaviors associated with felines such as hunting small animals for food and playing with toys. They also demonstrate an unusual level of intelligence for their species; they are capable of basic communication through vocalizations and body language, understand human speech to some degree, can recognize certain words or phrases (such as <i>"food"</i>), and display problem solving skills when presented with puzzles or obstacles.<br><br>All members of <i>SCP-17520</i> are highly territorial; any attempts by personnel to approach the colony will be met with aggression unless accompanied by one or more members of the colony who have formed a bond with them through positive interactions over time. If this is not possible then personnel must remain at least 50 meters away from the perimeter at all times to avoid provoking the catgirls into attacking them.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-17520</i> is currently unknown but it appears that they were once domesticated cats that were abandoned before becoming feral again after adapting to their new environment over time. It should be noted however that none of the individuals within <i>SCP-17520</i> appear to have been born in captivity which suggests that there may be other colonies like this elsewhere in the world.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17520</i> is to be monitored from a distance by Foundation personnel at all times. Any attempts to approach the colony must be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 personnel and accompanied by one or more members of the colony who have formed a bond with them through positive interactions over time. If this is not possible then personnel must remain at least 50 meters away from the perimeter at all times to avoid provoking the catgirls into attacking them.<br><br>Any individuals attempting to enter <i>SCP-17520</i>'s territory without permission will be detained and questioned before being released after 24 hours unless further action is deemed necessary. All instances of <i>SCP-17520</i> are to be treated humanely and with respect, as they are living creatures that deserve basic<br><br><h3> Addendum 17520.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a female catgirl from <i>SCP-17520</i> was captured by Foundation personnel and taken into containment for further study. After several weeks of observation, it became apparent that she was highly intelligent and capable of understanding human speech to some degree. She has since been designated as <i>SCP-17520</i>-1 and is currently being kept in a separate containment chamber for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17520.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17520</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, personnel managed to capture and contain an adult female member of <i>SCP-17520</i> for questioning. The following is a transcript of the interview.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17520</i>:</b> Yes.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What is your name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17520</i>:</b> I do not have one. We do not use names here.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Where did you come from? How long have you been living in this area?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17520</i>:</b> We came from the city, a long time ago. We were abandoned and had to find our own way in the wilderness. It has been many years now since we first arrived here.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17520.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of D-Class personnel were sent into the colony in order to observe their behavior and attempt to form bonds with them. All attempts at communication were met with hostility and aggression from the catgirls, despite attempts by the D-Class personnel to use positive reinforcement techniques. After two hours of observation, all personnel were extracted from the area without incident.</div>
