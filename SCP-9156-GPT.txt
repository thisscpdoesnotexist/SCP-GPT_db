No incoming calls have been received from this number either. It is unknown if the SIM card contained within <i>SCP-9156</i> belongs to a person or entity outside of this test log; as such,<br> any tests that may use its functionality will be documented below:<br><br>Test 1 - ██/██/<br>2014 Subject: D-8671 Procedure: D-8671 was instructed to place <i>SCP-9156</i> on his right ear and close his eyes.<br> Results: A black screen appeared on the display of <i>SCP-9156</i> for approximately 5 seconds before displaying the following message: <i>"Are you ready?"</i> After 10 seconds without response from D-8671, he was instructed again to place the device on his right ear and close his eyes once more; upon doing so, he fell into a deep sleep state (see Addendum 9156b). Three minutes later upon entering REM sleep stage 2 (according to EEG readings), D-8671 began experiencing vivid hallucinations relating events surrounding an individual named 'Hannibal'. The subject reported that these hallucinations were similar in nature as dreams he used to experience when younger; however currently there are no known cases relating these symptoms being caused by anomalous means (see Addendum 9156c). Approximately three hours after beginning testing with <i>SCP-9156</i>, Dr Johnson decided it would be best if they woke him up using standard methods and moved onto another test objective; though due to falling asleep during Stage 2 sleep cycle (a condition normally associated only with older individuals), waking him up proved difficult due not only waking up at all during REM Sleep Stage 2 but also because after three attempts were made it took an additional five minutes before Dr Johnson was able successfully wake D-8671 back up again via manual stimulation including poking him repeatedly on both sides of his body with two fingers along each side until eventually being manually woken back up into consciousness at 1143 hrs local time . Upon conclusion of testing session at 1210 hours local time , subject reported feeling slightly groggy and disoriented afterward but did not<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> On ██/██/2014, <i>SCP-9156</i> was found on the desk of Dr. A████ S████████ upon returning to his office after a short meeting with other members of Site-19's senior staff; however, there are currently no records of anyone giving or dropping the object in his office prior to discovery. The current whereabouts/identity of Dr S████████ are currently unknown.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9156.1 :</h3>  Incident Report<br><br>On ██/██/2014, after D-8671 was instructed to lay down during the second test, a series of loud knocks were heard from outside <i>SCP-9156</i>'s containment cell.  After approximately 4 minutes passed with no further activity from outside the door and cell, Dr Johnson opened the door to find one (1) unidentified humanoid entity standing in front of him at approximately 1.5 meters away from his position.  The entity was wearing a grey business suit and black tie similar to that worn by Dr S████████; however it is believed that this entity may have been an impostor due to its lack of facial features and body heat detected within its bodily structure. No physical signs relating to any injury were found on or around <i>SCP-9156</i>'s storage cell afterward; as such it is assumed that they both left together at some point between 1209 hrs local time and 1233 hrs local time . The whereabouts of both individuals are currently unknown (see Addendum 9156a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9156.2 :</h3>  Autopsy Report<br><br>During the autopsy of Dr S████████, a small grey device (slightly larger than the size of a fingernail) was found implanted in his head.  This object appears to be similar in nature to certain types of deep-brain stimulation devices used for treating Parkinson's disease and depression; however this particular device contained only two wires that were connected by an unknown substance (believed to be completely organic), which penetrated his brain and spinal cord. Further investigation is currently underway.<br></div>
