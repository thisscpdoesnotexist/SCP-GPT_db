Anyone who hears the singing will experience extreme feelings of joy and comfort, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof; this effect has been observed in both humans and animals alike.

This resulted in a massive influx of personnel requesting to be assigned to the containment area, resulting in several breaches before the signal could be shut down. All personnel affected by <i>SCP-17508</i>'s song have since been treated for their symptoms and returned to duty without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17508.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17508</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17508</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me why you sing?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17508</i>:</b> I sing because it is my purpose.
