Testing of <i>SCP-15009</i> requires approval from at least one Level 3 personnel.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15009</i> is a standard spoon, made of stainless steel. <i>SCP-15009</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is used to stir a liquid that contains any psychoactive drug. When stirred in this manner, the drug will be completely dissolved into the liquid after approximately three minutes.<br><br><i>SCP-15009</i> was discovered in ████████, France after reports of an unidentified man stirring drinks with a spoon at local bars and restaurants. He was apprehended by Foundation agents and administered amnestics before being released.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15009.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, the man who discovered <i>SCP-15009</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after the discovery of <i>SCP-15009</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So, Mr. ███████, can you tell me about what happened? <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>Well, I was at this bar in Paris and I ordered a drink from this really pretty waitress and she brought it out to me with a spoon in it and I thought that was kind of weird so I took the spoon out of my drink but then there wasn't enough room for all the ice in my glass so I put it back in but then it started to overflow so I tried stirring it with the spoon again and that's when all these bubbles came out of nowhere! And then there were more drinks on top of mine! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Did you know anything about chemicals or physics before this event? <br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>No sir, not at all. <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That's very interesting… Can you tell me how much money you made from selling your story to tabloids? Mr.: Oh no sir! This is my first time selling stories like that! It was just an accident! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject showed no signs of deception during interview; he has been given amnestics and released into civilian life under his original identity as per standard protocol for Foundation personnel involved with public exposure events such as this one .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15009.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log <i>SCP-15009</i> Experiment <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/2017<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9011, a 32 year old Caucasian male. Subject is not a drug user, and was administered Class B amnestics after testing. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9011 is instructed to stir a cup of water with <i>SCP-15009</i>. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately three minutes, the cup of water turns clear and smells faintly of alcohol. Analysis reveals that the water now contains approximately 0.2g/L of ethanol (the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages). Experiment <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/2017<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9011, same as previous experiment Subject is not a drug user, and was administered Class B amnestics after testing. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9011 is instructed to stir a cup containing 2g (approximately 1mL) of methamphetamine dissolved in 10mL of water with <i>SCP-15009</i> <br><br><b>Results: </b>After stirring for one minute twenty seconds, the liquid turns clear and smells faintly of alcohol. Analysis reveals that the liquid now contains approximately 0.2g/L methamphetamine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in methamphetamine). Experiment <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/2017<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 9012 , A 28 year old caucasian male . Subject has used both methamphetamines and alcohol on multiple occasions . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous experiments . <br><br><b>Results: </b>After stirring for two minutes , the liquid turns clear , smelling strongly like methanol or ethanol . Analysis reveals that the liquid now contains approximately 0 g / L amphetamine base ( The active ingredient in methamphetamines ) and 0 g / L ethanol ( The active ingredient in alcoholic beverages ) Experiment <br><br><b>Date: </b>██ / 10 / 2017 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Dr . T████ C████ , A 46 year old caucasian male who has previously used amphetamine recreationally on multiple occasions <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One gram each of cocaine hydrochloride , heroin hydrochloride , MDMA base , LSD tartrate salt & psilocybin were dissolved separately into 100 mLs each of distilled water or ethyl alcohol respectively before being poured into separate beakers along with 100 mLs each beakers containing only distilled water or ethyl alcohol respectively before being stirred for 3 minutes using SCP - 15 009 <br><br><b>Results: </b>All solutions turned completely clear after stirring for 3 minutes & smelled strongly like their respective solvents except when it came to psilocybin which instead smelled vaguely floral despite still turning completely clear . Analysis revealed that all solutions contained either no trace amounts or very low concentrations (<0 g / L ) Of their original ingredients while also containing trace amounts (<0 g / L ) Of other chemicals such as methanol & acetone which are present during synthesis but are removed from final products during purification processes</div>
