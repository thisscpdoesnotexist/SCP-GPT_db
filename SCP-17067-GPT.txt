Access to <i>SCP-17067</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective clothing and gloves at all times, as contact with <i>SCP-17067</i> can result in rapid shrinking.<br><br>Any subjects that have been shrunken by <i>SCP-17067</i> are to be monitored closely and provided with appropriate medical care if necessary. Research into reversing the effects of <i>SCP-17067</i> is ongoing, and any progress made should be reported immediately.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17067</i> is a wooden dollhouse approximately 1.5 meters in height and width, with four rooms arranged in a square pattern. <i>SCP-17067</i> appears to be an ordinary dollhouse, but any human that comes into contact with the object will begin to shrink rapidly until they are small enough to fit inside the house.<br><br>Once inside <i>SCP-17067</i>, subjects will find themselves unable to leave as the size of the doorways and windows are too small for them to pass through. Subjects can still move around within <i>SCP-17067</i>, but all attempts at communication or escape have been unsuccessful thus far. The interior of <i>SCP-17067</i> appears normal, although it has been observed that some objects such as furniture and toys may change position when no one is looking.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17067</i> appear permanent; subjects who have been shrunken by it remain so even after leaving its confines. Attempts at reversing this effect have met with failure thus far; however research is ongoing in order to find a way to restore subjects back their original size.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17067.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a small group of personnel entered <i>SCP-17067</i> in an attempt to explore its interior. All personnel were equipped with video and audio recording devices, as well as communication equipment. After approximately one hour of exploration, all personnel began to shrink rapidly until they were unable to exit the house.<br><br>After further investigation, it was determined that <i>SCP-17067</i> is inhabited by a family of miniature humanoids who appear to be living normal lives within the confines of the dollhouse. These entities are capable of speech and have been observed engaging in various activities such as cooking meals and playing games. The entities do not appear hostile towards outsiders but will refuse any attempts at communication or escape from their home.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17067.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/████, personnel were able to capture one of the entities living within <i>SCP-17067</i>. The entity, designated <i>SCP-17067</i>-1, was interviewed in order to gain further information about its home and inhabitants.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17067.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/████ - A volunteer subject was placed into <i>SCP-17067</i> in an attempt to communicate with the entities inhabiting it. The subject reported that they were able to understand the entities, but could not communicate with them due to the difference in size. After several minutes of attempting to communicate, the subject began shrinking rapidly and had to be removed from <i>SCP-17067</i> before becoming too small.</div>
