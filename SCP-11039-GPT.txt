It is a</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-11039</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-11039</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Personnel are not to smoke from <i>SCP-11039</i> unless given explicit permission by Dr. ██████.<br><br>Experiment Log 11039:<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11039</i> is an ornate brass pipe, approximately 30 cm in length. It has a silver mouthpiece, and a small red gemstone embedded in the bowl.<br><br><i>SCP-11039</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is used to smoke tobacco products. When smoked by any human being, <i>SCP-11039</i> will transport its user to a pocket dimension where they will be surrounded by other individuals who are smoking <i>SCP-11039</i>. All individuals present will be dressed as 19th century English gentlemen and ladies of varying social classes . Individuals using <i>SCP-11039</i> are referred to as <i>"users"</i>.<br><br>In this pocket dimension, users are able to interact with one another normally; however physical contact between users does not occur unless both parties have been smoking from <i>SCP-11039</i> for at least 5 minutes . Users may converse with one another normally; however if two or more users have been smoking from <i>SCP-11039</i> for less than 5 minutes , they will only be able to communicate through pantomime . If two or more users have been smoking from SCP- 110 39 for at least 5 minutes , they may verbally communicate with one another in their native languages. Users cannot hear the speech of non -users while interacting within the pocket dimension , but can hear sounds produced by non -users outside of the pocket dimension (See Addendum 110 39 -1).<br><br>When not being used, all effects caused by exposure to SCP -1 10 39 cease immediately . However once exposed again , these effects resume immediately without requiring further exposure time (see Experiment Log 110 39 ). These effects also do not seem dependent on whether or not the subject was aware that he/she had previously interacted with other subjects using an instance of SC P -11 0 3 9: subjects who were exposed unknowingly were still capable of communicating verbally after having smoked from an instance of SC P -11 0 3 9 again (see Experiment Log 1 10 3 9). Subjects who were aware that they had previously interacted with other subjects using an instance o f S C P - 11 0 3 9 report no memory o f said interactions even under hypnosis (see Experiment Log 1 10 3 9).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11039.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-11039</i>-1, a Caucasian male in his late twenties. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted to determine the extent of <i>SCP-11039</i>'s anomalous properties. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, 11039 -1 . <i>SCP-11039</i> - 1: Morning to you too, doc! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>I'm going to ask you some questions about your experiences with 11039 . <i>SCP-11</i> 0 39 - 1: Sure thing, doc! Fire away! (<i>SCP-11</i> 0 39 -1 lights a cigarette from an instance of <i>SCP-11</i> 0 3 9) <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you tell me how long have you been smoking? (SCP 111 39 -1 inhales deeply from his cigarette and exhales.) <i>SCP-10</i> 139 - 1: Oh man… I don't even know anymore… it's been so many years… at least 20 or 30 years now… (Dr . ███ pauses for a moment.) Dr . ▒▐██▌: Do you remember when the first time was? How did it happen? (SCP 1113 9 1 takes another drag from his cigarette before responding.) SCP 11 03 9~1: Well , that's kind of hard to say actually … I mean , I can't really remember how it all started … but what I do remember is that one day , all o f a sudden , there were these people around me … and they were all smoking this pipe just like me … and we just started talking about stuff … It was pretty weird at first but then after while it got real comfortable being around them... y'know? It felt like we had known each other for ages already even though we just met moments ago.. And ever since then that became my daily routine .. y'know.. Hanging out with friends every day .. smoking this pipe.. 'till one day they disappeared on me ...and haven't seen them since then…. (Dr . ▒▐██▌ pauses for a moment before continuing.) Dr . ▒▐██ ▌: Do you know where they went ? Who are these people ? What are their names ? Why did they disappear on you ? What happened next? Are there more people like them somewhere else ? Are there more pipes like this somewhere else as well ? Why are those people dressed in 19th century clothing anyway ? Can any other person use this pipe as well or is it only limited to users who have previously interacted with others using an instance of SC P - 11 0 3 9 ??? For God ' s sake man ! Tell us something ! Anything ! Just please give us something here!!! We've been trying t o figure out what the hell is going on here for weeks now !! You're our last hope !!!!!! PLEASE !!!!!! Just tell us anything !!! ANYTHING AT ALL!!! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Prior history of substance abuse and violent behavior.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to smoke from <i>SCP-11039</i> once every hour for 8 hours. He was then instructed to describe his experiences while using <i>SCP-11039</i>. After each interaction with other subjects, he was also asked to describe any new subjects that he came into contact with . This experiment took place at Site 19 on ██/██/20██ . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please state your name for the record D - 101 9: [REDACTED] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Thank you, please begin your report after smoking from the pipe for the first time . D - 101 9: I'm in a pub, it's dark and gloomy looking , but there are people here dressed like they're from Victorian England or something like that. There's a lot of wood everywhere and everyone is smoking pipes just like this one… oh hey! There's another guy here who has one just like mine! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you describe him? D - 1 01 9: Well he looks pretty much exactly like me except his clothes are different… wait no they aren't actually… hmm weird.. anyway he has a pipe in his mouth too so I guess we're both smoking this thing right now? He looks pretty normal though, nothing special about him aside from the clothes really… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you ask him if he knows why you are both here? D - 1 01 9: Oh yeah sure thing doc (5 minutes pass) Hey dude do y o u know why we're h e re ? The subject points toward himself with one hand while holding <i>SCP-11039</i> in the other hand . Nonverbal response received indicating confusion (see Addendum 1103 9 -1 ). 5 minutes later Nonverbal response received indicating understanding (see Addendum 110 39 -1). <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Based on Experiment 10 39 – 1 , it appears that nonverbal communication is possible between users who have had at least 5 minutes of exposure time together regardless of how long ago they were exposed to SCP – 11 0 3 9 . Further testing is required to determine what factors affect said communication ability; however it seems likely that longer periods of exposure will increase its effectiveness as well as overall clarity and speed of communication between users (See Experiment Log 1103 9). It should be noted that all subsequent experiments carried out by personnel have confirmed these results; however further experimentation may be required due to discrepancies between reports given by different test subjects regarding their experiences within the pocket dimension created by SCP – 11 0 3 09 (See Experiment Logs 1103 2 through 11 03 7).</div>
