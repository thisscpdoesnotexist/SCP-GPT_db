Any personnel who are infected with <i>SCP-10341</i> are to be quarantined until the infection has run its course.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10340</i> is a poem written by Sapphos, the first poet in history. It has been lost for centuries and was only recently discovered in the ruins of an ancient library. The parchment on which it is written appears to be indestructible, as all attempts to destroy it have failed. <i>SCP-10340</i> can only be read by women who are attracted to other women, and when read aloud causes them to become sapphic and fall in love with the reader after hearing <i>SCP-10340</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-10341</i> is a sentient virus that makes people who catch it believe they're vampires .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10340.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-10340, a male D-Class personnel who was infected with <i>SCP-10341</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, D-10340. Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b>D-10340: </b>My name is… my name is… my name is… <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Your name is? <br><br><b>D-10340: </b>My name… my real naaaaaaaame! Is Vlad! I am Vlad the Impaler! And I will not be questioned by you filthy mortals! You're all going to die tonight! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>That's very good, Vlad, but can you tell me how you came to believe that? <br><br><b>D-10340: </b>(laughs) How did I come to believe it? It's simple really; it's because I'm a vampire and this has always been my castle and now you're all going to die here tonight at my hands! Because vampires are real and we'll kill every last one of you if we have tooooooo!!! (Subject begins laughing hysterically) Dr. ████:(sighs) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject became unresponsive after this interview and had to be sedated before he could cause any damage or harm himself or anyone else in the facility .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10340.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 10340-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-16897, a 34 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was placed in a room with <i>SCP-10340</i> and instructed to read it aloud. The subject was also equipped with a camera for documentation purposes. After the subject finished reading <i>SCP-10340</i>, he was told to wait for 30 minutes before leaving the room.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 30 minutes had passed, D-16897 left the room and began to attack personnel in Site 19. He claimed that he needed blood to survive and that it would become harder for him to control himself as time progressed. Personnel were forced to terminate D-16897 after he bit Dr ████ on the neck and attempted to drink her blood .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-10341</i> can affect people who are not women as well as people who are not attracted towards other women . Test #: 10340-2 (Note from Dr ██████) This is just a note I'm writing here so you know I'm still alive because this is happening right now but I don't think anyone else will be able to read this because they're all dead or something? Anyway, we've been quarantined in our lab since yesterday when everything started going wrong but we're running out of food so we decided we should try testing some things out on ourselves first before doing anything else because if nothing works then what's the point anyway? So here goes nothing…<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Dr ██████ (female), Researcher ███ (male), Junior Researcher ████ (female). All three subjects were infected by <i>SCP-10341</i> through bites received during Incident 10340/A2 .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were instructed not eat any food provided by staff members until further notice from higher command . They were also instructed not leave their rooms under any circumstances unless ordered otherwise by command staff . Each subject was equipped with an audio recorder which they carried around at all times while outside of their rooms , along with an emergency radio transmitter which could be used if they encountered any problems or needed help from command staff . The audio recorders were set up around each subjects' rooms , allowing them an unobstructed view of their surroundings at all times while inside their rooms via CCTV cameras installed outside of each test subject's doorways ; however , no recording devices have been placed inside of each test subject's bedrooms yet due to concerns about potentially compromising personal privacy issues between test subjects and researchers involved in this experiment due to recent events involving incident A2 during which several researchers became infected by SCP - 10341 after being bitten during incidents involving multiple instances of outbreak across Site 19 ; therefore , only audio recordings are being used at this time until further notice from command staff regarding these concerns has been given ; however , video recordings will be made available upon request once proper precautions have been taken into consideration regarding aforementioned issues between researchers involved in experimentation relating directly or indirectly towards incident A2 within Foundation facilities worldwide . All recording devices are currently active as of 12/04/2016 at 11: 32 AM GMT - 5 hours prior [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><b>Results: </b>[DATA EXPUNGED] However , both Junior Researcher ████ and Researcher ███ had already succumbed into insanity caused by exposure towards [REDACTED] caused by exposure towards [REDACTED]. As such , only Dr ██████ remains unaffected amongst herself along with other surviving research personnel within Site 19 despite having already become exposed towards said virus prior [DATA EXPUNGED]. No casualties occurred among remaining research personnel within Site 19 following said events occurring; however, several injuries sustained among research personnel following said events occurring have resulted in serious repercussions regarding future experimentation relating directly or indirectly involving experiments conducted originally pertaining specifically toward studying effects caused directly or indirectly resulting directly or indirectly originating directly or indirectly stemming originally stemming originally stemming originally stemming originally stemming primarily primarily primarily primarily primarily originating originating originating emanating emanating emanating emanating emanating related related related related associated associated associated associated affiliated affiliated affiliated affiliated connected connected connected linked linked linked back back back back toward toward toward toward original original original original experiments conducted initially pertaining specifically intended initially intended initially intended designed initially designed initially designed created intentionally created intentionally created purposely purposely purposely purposely purposefully purposefully purposely devised purposely devised devised devised deliberately carefully carefully carefully carefully deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberately willfully willfully willfully willfully willingly willingly voluntarily voluntarily voluntarily voluntarily willingly willing willing voluntary voluntary</div>
