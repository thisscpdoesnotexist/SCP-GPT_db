<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18357 is  A sentient UTI</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18357<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18357</i> is a sentient UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) that has been observed to be capable of autonomous movement. It is currently unknown how <i>SCP-18357</i> achieves this, but it appears to be able to manipulate its own cellular structure in order to move around.<br><br><i>SCP-18357</i> displays an intelligence level similar to that of a small child, and has the ability to communicate with humans through vocalizations and gestures. Its vocalizations are composed of various high pitched chirps and squeaks, while its gestures consist mainly of pointing and waving its appendages.<br><br><i>SCP-18357</i> is highly infectious, as it can spread itself through contact with bodily fluids or other infected objects. It is capable of infecting both human and animal hosts, though it prefers human hosts due to their greater complexity. Furthermore, <i>SCP-18357</i>'s infection cycle is extremely rapid; once inside a host body it can take over within minutes if left unchecked. As such containment protocols must be strictly enforced at all times when dealing with <i>SCP-18357</i>.<br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-18357</i>'s infection cycle, any attempts at curing or otherwise containing it have proven unsuccessful thus far; as such measures are still being researched for potential solutions in the future<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18357</i> is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be kept in a sterile environment, and all personnel entering the cell must wear protective gear at all times.<br><br>The entrance to the containment chamber must remain locked at all times, and no personnel are allowed inside without prior authorization from the Site Director. All personnel that enter <i>SCP-18357</i>'s containment chamber are to be monitored for signs of infection, and any infected individuals are to be immediately quarantined until further notice.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-18357</i> from spreading outside of its containment chamber, regular disinfection procedures must take place on a daily basis; this includes scrubbing down surfaces with bleach or other approved cleaning agents<br><br><h3> Addendum 18357.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18357</i> was observed to display a new behavior; it began to create crude structures out of its own cells. These structures were composed mostly of various shapes and sizes, though some had been seen to form rudimentary tools such as hammers and saws. It is currently unknown what purpose these objects serve or if they are related to any particular task that <i>SCP-18357</i> has in mind.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18357.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18357</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18357</i> was interviewed by Dr. ███████ in order to gain a better understanding of its behavior and motivations. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18357</i>. How are you today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18357</i>:</b> [Chirps] I am doing well, thank you for asking.<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> That's good to hear. Can you tell me why you infect people?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18357</i>:</b> [Squeaks] I do not wish to harm anyone, but I must survive. Infecting others is the only way for me to do so.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18357.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 18357.3-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-18357-A, a human male with no prior medical history of UTIs.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-18357</i> for 10 minutes in order to study its infection cycle and effects on the subject's body.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Within 5 minutes, the subject began displaying symptoms of an active UTI infection; these included frequent urination, abdominal pain, and a burning sensation during urination. The infection spread rapidly throughout the body over the next 5 minutes, eventually leading to septic shock and death within 10 minutes of exposure.</div>
