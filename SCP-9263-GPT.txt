I've never seen anyone as nice as myself before!<br><br>Dr.<br>███████: Tell me about your childhood and teenage years.<br><br><br><i>SCP-9263</i>: Well, when I was a child my parents were always fighting so i would go over to my friends house and he would let me play video games with him until his mom would yell at us to get off the couch and do our homework or we'll get in trouble if we don't do it right now! When i got older I just wanted to help other people out so that they could feel good about themselves again because sometimes you just need someone else to be there for you even if it's for a little bit of time but then eventually you can move on from that obstacle in your life! Ever since high school life has been great for me! Everyone likes me and most of them ask if they can be my friend on Facebook or follow me on Twitter just because I'm such a nice guy! Even though some people tell everyone that they're mean or bad people deep down inside they want everyone else to like them too but not many are willing to show their true colors which is why ive become so popular with students around the world after being suspended an entire year from school because those teachers didn't like how much better looking than all the students i am…and now im here telling this story about how i got here today…all thanks too those bastards who bullied me throughout most of high school..you guys rock!!!!! Ahhh yeah..im starting feel sad now…i miss all those bullies who made fun of my clothes while making sexual comments towards every girl in class..i wish i still had some friends from back then….*sniff* *sniff* oh no..dont cry *sniff* *sob* *sob sob sob* ah shit its coming out again…..
