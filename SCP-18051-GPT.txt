The contents of the bottle appear to be a bright red liquid, and have an extremely high Scoville rating (measured at ████ SHU).<br><br>When <i>SCP-18051</i> is opened and consumed, it will cause extreme discomfort in any living organism that consumes it. This includes burning sensations in the mouth, throat, stomach and intestines. In addition to this physical pain, subjects have also reported experiencing intense psychological distress due to the sensation of heat emanating from within their bodies.<br><br>The most unusual property of <i>SCP-18051</i> is its ability to defy thermodynamic laws; despite being stored at room temperature (20°C), when opened and consumed by a subject its internal temperature will rise exponentially until reaching temperatures far beyond what would normally be considered possible for a liquid substance (measured up to ████°C). This increase in temperature does not appear to dissipate even after <i>SCP-18051</i> has been digested or expelled from the body; instead it remains constant until either naturally dissipating over time or being neutralized by an external force such as cold water or ice cubes. <br><br>It should be noted that while consuming <i>SCP-18051</i> can result in serious injury if not properly monitored/treated immediately afterwards, there are currently no known long term effects associated with exposure. It should also be noted that attempts at containing <i>SCP-18051</i> have proven unsuccessful so far; any attempt at doing so results in immediate containment breach as soon as the lid is removed due to its anomalous properties.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18051</i> is to be kept in a locked storage container at all times and only accessed by personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any attempts at containing <i>SCP-18051</i> must be approved by the Site Director prior to implementation.<br><br>In the event of a containment breach, personnel are instructed to immediately evacuate the area and contact MTF Epsilon-6 (<i>"Village Idiots"</i>) for assistance.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18051.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-18051</i> on inanimate objects. A standard steel cube (measuring 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) was exposed to <i>SCP-18051</i> for a period of 15 minutes. During this time, the temperature of the cube rose exponentially until reaching temperatures far beyond what would normally be considered possible for a solid object (measured up to ████°C). The cube then exploded violently, causing significant structural damage to the containment chamber and injuring several personnel in the process.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18051.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><br>On ██/██/████, Subject ████ was interviewed regarding their experience with <i>SCP-18051</i>. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell me what happened when you consumed <i>SCP-18051</i>? <br><b>Subject:</b> Well, at first it didn't seem so bad. It tasted like any other hot sauce I've had before, but then the heat started to build up and it felt like my insides were on fire. It was really intense and I thought I was going to die. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How long did this sensation last? <br><b>Subject:</b> It lasted for about an hour or so until eventually the pain subsided and I could feel my body cooling down. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any advice for anyone considering consuming <i>SCP-18051</i>? <br><b>Subject:</b> Definitely don't do it. It's not worth the risk. If you absolutely must, make sure to keep a glass of cold water nearby and drink it immediately after consuming the sauce.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18051.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18051-A:</b><br>Subject was instructed to consume one teaspoon of <i>SCP-18051</i>. Subject immediately began experiencing extreme discomfort due to the heat emanating from their body. Subject was treated with cold water and ice packs, which successfully reduced the temperature back to normal levels within 15 minutes. <br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> <i>SCP-18051</i> is capable of causing extreme physical and psychological distress in any living organism that consumes it, but can be neutralized with external forces such as cold water or ice packs.</div>
