<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18311 is  a McDonalds open 25 hours a day</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18311<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18311</i> is an anomalous McDonalds restaurant located in [REDACTED], Ohio. <i>SCP-18311</i> appears to be a normal McDonalds restaurant, however it has been observed to be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and never closes. The interior of the restaurant never changes regardless of how many customers enter or leave and no staff are ever seen inside.<br><br>The only personnel present within <i>SCP-18311</i> are two anomalous entities referred to as <i>SCP-18311</i>-1 and -2. Both entities appear human, with <i>SCP-18311</i>-1 being male and -2 female. They both wear uniforms that match those worn by McDonalds employees, but their faces remain obscured by what appears to be black cloth masks at all times. Neither entity speaks nor interacts with anyone other than each other, though they can understand basic commands when given them via writing on paper or spoken aloud.<br><br>When customers enter the restaurant they will find that all items on the menu are available for purchase at any time of day regardless of what should normally be available during certain hours; this includes breakfast items such as pancakes and eggs even if it is past noon or evening items such as burgers even if it is morning. All food served from the establishment tastes normal despite its anomalous origin, though no ingredients have ever been found in any dishes served fromSCP 18311 . <br><br>Any customer who attempts to leave without paying for their meal will find themselves unable to do so until payment has been made; this effect extends beyond simply leaving through one of the exits as customers have reported feeling an invisible force preventing them from exiting through windows or walls when attempting escape without paying first .  Additionally , any attempts made by personnel outside of SCP 18311 to breach its walls have proven unsuccessful due to an unknown force which prevents entry into the building . <br><br>It should also be noted that while no staff can be seen inside SCP 18311 , there have been reports from customers claiming they were served their meals by someone wearing a black cloth mask similar in appearance to those worn bySCP 183 11 - 1 & 2 . It is currently unknown how these masked individuals serve food without being detected within the premises . <br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18311</i> is to be monitored at all times by personnel stationed outside of the building. Any attempts made by personnel to enter the premises must be approved by a Level 4 or higher staff member. All customers entering <i>SCP-18311</i> are to be monitored and questioned upon exiting the restaurant, with any information regarding their experience inside being documented for further research.<br><br>Any individuals found attempting to leave without paying for their meal are to be detained and questioned as per standard protocol before being released.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18311.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a D-Class personnel was sent into SCP 18311 to investigate the restaurant further. Upon entering the premises, the D-Class reported feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and fear , claiming that he felt as if someone was watching him from within the shadows . After ordering his meal and attempting to leave without paying , he was unable to do so until payment had been made . <br><br>Upon exiting SCP 18311 , the D-Class reported feeling relieved but could not recall any specifics regarding his experience inside other than feeling scared . No further information has been gathered regarding this incident at this time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18311.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18311</i>-1 & 2<br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18311</i>-1 and -2 were interviewed by Dr. █████ in an attempt to gain more information regarding the anomalous nature of the establishment. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> Can you tell me why this restaurant never closes? <br><b><br>SCP 18311 - 1 & 2:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> Do you know who owns this place? <br><b><br>SCP 18311 - 1 & 2:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> How do customers pay for their meals here if there are no employees present? <br><b><br>SCP 18311 - 1 & 2:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> Do you know what happens to the customers who don't pay for their meals? <br><b><br>SCP 18311 - 1 & 2:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> Very well, I think that's all for now. Thank you for your time. <br><b><br>SCP 18311 - 1 & 2:</b> [No response]<br><br><h3> Addendum 18311.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18311-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a Level 3 personnel was sent into <i>SCP-18311</i> to observe the anomalous entities. Upon entering, the personnel reported seeing both <i>SCP-18311</i>-1 and -2 standing behind the counter. The entities did not acknowledge their presence in any way and remained motionless throughout the experiment. After ordering a meal from the menu, they were served by an unknown individual wearing a black cloth mask similar to those worn bySCP 183 11 - 1 & 2 . <br><br>The food tasted normal despite its anomalous origin and upon finishing their meal they attempted to leave without paying for it.
