The containment chamber is to be located at the bottom floor of Site-██, which is located in ██████, ██. <i>SCP-15026</i>'s containment chamber must have a single door leading outside the building containing it; however, this door must be locked from the inside so that no one can enter or exit said room without permission from personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15026</i> is a malevolent entity that has taken over a Foundation Site. <i>SCP-15026</i> is the reason why personnel at the Site are acting weird and doing things they normally wouldn't do.<br><br><i>SCP-15026</i> was discovered when an Agent was sent to investigate why there were reports of people going missing in an area where there shouldn't be any people. The Agent found out that all these people were on a vacation at the time, but never came back. The Agent then went to find out what happened, and discovered <i>SCP-15026</i>'s existence. The Agent then reported back to his superiors about this discovery, and told them that he would go on another mission to find out more information about him/her/it/them. He then got sent on another mission with one other Agent, who ended up disappearing after he went off alone from the main group of Agents (the main group consisted of 5 Agents). After this happened, two more Agents were sent in after him/her/it/them; however, they too disappeared without trace when they tried to follow him into some woods near where he disappeared from view (the woods being near a lake). When two more Agents tried following the same trail as before (with one staying behind), both ended up disappearing without trace as well when they entered into those woods near that lake (one was wearing recording equipment which recorded everything up until it stopped working while inside those woods). After this happened, all other Agents who attempted entering those woods or going anywhere near them disappeared without trace as well when they entered into or got close enough for their GPS signal being tracked by Foundation satellites located around Earth's atmosphere; however, it seems like their bodies have been found outside of those woods despite not having any traces of them ever entering into or getting close enough for their GPS signals being tracked by Foundation satellites located around Earth's atmosphere within 1 km radius from where their bodies were found within 1 year period after disappearance occurred along with signs showing that something dragged them away before eating them alive somewhere else because no traces have been found within 1 km radius from where their bodies were found either even though tracks leading towards said place can be seen everywhere around said place along with signs showing something dragging something heavy across ground nearby said place due to deep grooves left behind by whatever dragged whatever it was dragging across ground nearby said place which also shows signs indicating whoever dragged whatever it was dragging across ground nearby said place had long legs and sharp claws since deep grooves left behind by<br><br><h3>Addendum 15026.2 : </h3>Interview with ____, a person who was inside the Site when <i>SCP-15026</i> took over.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ____ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted with _____, who was one of the first people to enter into the Site after <i>SCP-15026</i> took over it. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello there!

After Subject entered said room, it was locked and the door leading outside of the building containing <i>SCP-15026</i> was opened. After this happened, the door leading outside of said building containing <i>SCP-15026</i> was locked again and then sealed off with concrete so that no one can enter or exit said room without permission from personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher (in order to prevent anyone from trying to free him/her/it/them). The Agent then waited for 30 minutes before going inside again in order to see if he/she/it had any changes in behavior. The Agent also brought a camera with him so that he could record everything that happened during his time inside there (the video recording will be attached at the end of this document). The Agent also brought some food and water along with him just in case something bad happens while he is inside there; however, it seems like they are not needed since nothing bad has happened yet as far as we know…<br><br><b>Results: </b>When I went inside his containment chamber again after waiting for 30 minutes outside his containment chamber like I am supposed to do before entering into his containment chamber again after waiting for 30 minutes outside his containment chamber like I am supposed to do before entering into his containment chamber again after waiting for 30 minutes outside his containme-, oh yeah! Anyway, when I went back inside there after waiting for 30 more minutes just like last time when I waited another half an hour just now before going back inside here because maybe something is preventing me from entering into here even though nothing should be able to prevent me from doing so because only people who have Level 4 clearance or higher are allowed entry here unless they have permission from someone who has Level 4 clearance or higher but no one else is allowed entry here unless they have permission from someone who has Level 4 clearance or higher but no one else is al-, well you get it right? Anyway when I went back in there after waiting another half an hour just now before going back in there because maybe something prevented me from getting out until now even though nothing should be able to prevent me getting out until now even though nothing should be able [REDACTED]<br><br></div>
