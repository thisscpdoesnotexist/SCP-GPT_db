It follows the lives of two protagonists, both in their early twenties:<br><br>• <i>"Ally,"</i> an outgoing asexual woman who works as a freelance writer for various publications.<br>• <i>"Noah,"</i> an introverted bisexual man who works at a local cafe.<br><br>The show is written, produced and directed by the same individual - referred to only as <i>"the Creator"</i>. The content of each episode consists primarily of conversations between Ally and Noah about topics such as relationships, sex, gender identity and social issues. <br><br><i>SCP-20324</i> appears to be anomalous in that it has been running continuously since its inception in ██/██/████ with no signs of slowing or stopping production any time soon. Furthermore, despite the fact that neither Ally nor Noah have ever been seen outside of the show's digital mediums (Tumblr and YouTube), both are widely regarded by viewers as being real people with genuine feelings towards one another. <br><br>It is currently unknown how <i>SCP-20324</i> was created or why it continues to exist; however research into this phenomenon is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-20324</i>, it is impossible to contain or remove from its current mediums. As such, all efforts must be focused on monitoring and limiting the spread of information regarding <i>SCP-20324</i>. All personnel assigned to this task are required to have a basic understanding of Tumblr and YouTube's content policies in order to ensure that any posts related to <i>SCP-20324</i> do not violate said policies. <br><br>In addition, Foundation webcrawlers have been deployed across both platforms in order to detect any new episodes or other forms of media related to <i>SCP-20324</i> before they can become widely known. Any such material is then removed and stored at Site ██ for further analysis.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20324.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a new episode of <i>SCP-20324</i> was released. In this episode, Ally and Noah discussed the concept of asexuality in depth, with Noah expressing his support for Ally's identity. This has been interpreted by viewers as an attempt by the Creator to normalize asexuality and bisexuality within their audience.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20324.2: </h3> Interview with <i>"The Creator"</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, Foundation personnel were able to locate and interview the individual responsible for <i>SCP-20324</i>. Interview was conducted by Dr. ██████.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, can you tell me a bit about yourself?<br><b><br>The Creator:</b> Well, I'm an independent filmmaker and writer. I've been making films since I was in high school, but this is the first time I've tried something like this. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> And why did you decide to create <i>SCP-20324</i>? <br><b><br>The Creator:</b> Honestly, it just sort of happened. It started as a way to explore different topics that weren't being discussed anywhere else - especially those related to sexuality and gender identity - but it quickly grew into something much bigger than that. Now it's become a kind of outlet for me and for other people who might be struggling with the same issues. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any plans for the future of <i>SCP-20324</i>? <br><b><br>The Creator:</b> Not really, no. I'm just taking it one episode at a time and seeing where it goes from there.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20324.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to determine the effect of introducing an outside element into the show. A Foundation agent was inserted into the series as a new character and instructed to interact with Ally and Noah in order to observe their reactions. <br><br>The results were inconclusive; both characters appeared to treat the agent as if he were an old friend, despite having never met him before. Furthermore, no changes in behavior or dialogue were observed during or after his introduction.</div>
