<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-23858 is  a phenomenon where someone becomes completely unrecognizable, even to people who knew them all their life, unless they're wearing a funny hat</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-23858<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-23858</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that affects individuals, causing them to become unrecognizable to even those who knew them all their life. The affected individual's physical features will remain the same, but their facial features and body language will be drastically altered in a manner that makes them appear completely different from their original appearance.<br><br>The only way for the affected individual to return to their original appearance is by wearing a funny hat. The exact type of hat does not matter, as long as it meets the criteria of being <i>"funny"</i>. Upon donning this hat, the affected individual will instantly revert back to their former self and can then be recognized by anyone who previously knew them.<br><br><i>SCP-23858</i> was first observed in ████████ on ██/██/20██ when several individuals reported seeing someone they had known for years suddenly change into an unrecognizable person without any visible cause or explanation. After further investigation, it was determined that these people were all wearing funny hats at the time of transformation and reverted back once they removed said hats.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-23858</i>, it is impossible to contain or prevent its occurrence. As such, containment efforts are focused on monitoring individuals who have been affected by <i>SCP-23858</i> and providing them with funny hats when necessary. Affected individuals must be monitored at all times in order to ensure that they do not lose their hat and remain unrecognizable.<br><br>In addition, any reports of people becoming unrecognizable due to <i>SCP-23858</i> must be investigated immediately in order to determine the cause and provide appropriate assistance if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23858.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a new instance of <i>SCP-23858</i> was observed in ████████. This time, the affected individual was not wearing a funny hat and remained unrecognizable until they were provided with one by Foundation personnel. It is currently unknown if this is an isolated incident or if it will be observed again in the future.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23858.2: </h3> Interview with D-88382<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-88382, an individual affected by <i>SCP-23858</i>.<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> D-88382 was interviewed in order to gain further insight into the phenomenon of <i>SCP-23858</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> How did you become affected by <i>SCP-23858</i>?<br><b>D-88382:</b> I was at a party and someone handed me a funny hat to wear as a joke.
