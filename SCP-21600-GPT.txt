<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21600 is  a stone that always kills exactly two birds every time it's thrown.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21600<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21600</i> is a medium-sized, grey stone of irregular shape. When thrown into the air, it will always kill two birds in its vicinity before returning to the ground. The type of bird killed is random, but has been observed to include both avian species native to the area and migratory birds.<br><br>The stone appears to be indestructible and cannot be moved more than a few meters away from its original location without triggering its effect. Attempts to contain it have failed due to its ability to teleport back into place after being removed from the area.<br><br>Research suggests that <i>SCP-21600</i>'s effects are not limited by distance or time; as long as there are two birds within range when it is thrown, they will be killed regardless of their location or how long ago they were present in the area.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21600</i> is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to the locker is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Personnel are not permitted to throw <i>SCP-21600</i> under any circumstances, and must take all necessary precautions when handling it. Any birds killed by <i>SCP-21600</i> must be disposed of immediately after being discovered.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21600.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a flock of birds was observed gathering around <i>SCP-21600</i>. After several minutes of observation, the birds flew away without incident. It is unclear why this behavior occurred and further research is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21600.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21600</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a remote interview was conducted with <i>SCP-21600</i>. The following is an excerpt from the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Why do you kill birds?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21600</i>:</b> I do not know. It is simply my nature to do so.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21600.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 21600.1:</b> Two birds were released into a contained area, and <i>SCP-21600</i> was thrown into the air. Upon impact, both birds were killed instantly.<br><b><br>Experiment 21600.2:</b> Two migratory birds were released into the same area as in Experiment 21600.1 and <i>SCP-21600</i> was again thrown into the air. Both of these birds were also killed upon impact with the stone.</div>
