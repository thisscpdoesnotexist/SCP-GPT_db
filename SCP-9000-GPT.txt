It has light blue feathers, and its eyes are of the same color. When observed closely, its eyes resemble those of a human's.<br><br>When it was first found by Agent ██████ , it was crying loudly in the middle of the field on his property. He tried to shoo it away, but when he touched <i>SCP-9000-GPT</i>, he found out that nothing happens when he touches it except for him feeling something warm on his finger tips.

I was just walking around my land, inspecting for any abnormalities when I heard a loud noise coming from behind me. So, naturally, I turned around to see what it is. And there it was… A crying chicken(SCP-9000). When I approached it, nothing happened except that my finger tips felt warm. At first, I tried to shoo it away from my property as fast as possible because there are too many weird things going on in this world and we don't need another one of them right now . But then again… What if this thing could be useful? So then (after 2 hours), after making sure no one would bother him anymore , he crawled under my bed and fell asleep . Later on (after 1 day), he stopped crying all together and fell asleep under my bed , so i decided to make a small aviary for him in Site ██ so that others won't be able to bother him anymore.<br><br><h5>Addendum9000.2:</h5> During a test conducted by Dr. ██████, SCP-9000 was exposed to a chicken carcass for 1 hour, and then observed closely afterwards. It was found out that the feathers on its right wing are slightly disfigured , and it only has an eye on its left eye socket .<br></div>
