He is very dangerous, and should be contained in a 5m x 5m room.<br><br><i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> has no physical body, but can posses any object that has been left alone for more than 2 hours. If it does this, and the object is capable of containing itself, then SCP-9000 will create a copy of itself inside of the object. SCP-9000 will not leave its host until it recieves knowledge on how to build an explosive device capable of destroying all solid matter in approximately 1 mile radius around it (this would kill all living beings). Once this knowledge has been obtained, SCP-9020 will leave its host and attempt to learn how to construct said device. Should this occur without containment measures being taken against SCP 9020's actions prior to his possessing knowledge on explosives construction methods then he will begin constructing said device at once by converting human beings into various components needed for explosive devices such as C4 or other explosive materials using a black colored substance produced by two unidentified organ(s) located within his body that are connected directly to his brain. This substance was found by Dr ********** when conducting an autopsy on SCP 9001's most recent victim; Dr ********** was turned into one component herself (explosives). So far there have been 8 victims who have lost their lives trying think up some kind if containment measure agaisnt what we now call 9001 but none have proved successful yet."<br><br><br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> <i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> was first discovered by the foundation on ██/██/████ when he was sighted entering a restaurant in █████████, Belgium. Some of the foundation's agents went into the restaurant and asked if they could use their bathroom. The owner of the restaurant allowed them to do so and said "Sure, it's right down that hall." SCP 9001 then possesed one of the agents who had just entered and began talking to another agent about how he could use him as a host. The other agent said "What? You mean you're not going to…." 9001 then threw his new host out of a window to his death and walked away (the possesed agent).<br><br><i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> was then contacted by an undercover operative after this incident which led him into an unmarked van in which they were taken back to site 19 for questioning. During questioning, SCP-9000 claimed that he has been here on earth since its creation 5 billion years ago but that nobody had ever seen him because he can only be seen when someone is alone otherwise he becomes invisible again. He also said that all matter in space attracts each other at all times (even light) which is why we have gravity too us even though there is no way for gravity waves or whatever they are called supposedly work because something can't push themselves towards something else without some kind of force pushing it there but I digress… Anyways.. After revealing this information Dr ********** escorted SCP 9020 back into her office after she informed everybody else about what had happened earlier today so she could ask any questions she wanted before making a report later on at night once everybody was gone from site 19 except for herself, Dr **********, Agent ████████ who arrived late due to traffic problems caused by road construction taking place near his house located somewhere in [DATA EXPUNGED] roughly 10 miles away from site 19 where most all employees live anyway so nobody cares where they live as long as they get their job done anyways…<br><br><br><br>Anyways.. Once inside her office Dr ************ closed the door behind her and made sure it was locked before asking any questions she wanted answered by 9001 himself including asking him what time it currently was (which turned out not be possible due to human beings being unable tp view time itself therefore making knowing what time anything exists impossible; apparently we don't observe time directly rather than indirectly through physical processes such as observing motion or change over time such as measuring how fast an object moves over some distance). After finding out everything important there is regarding 9001's existence during this encounter with Dr ********** , [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h5>Dr *******'s autopsy report:</h5><br><br><br><br><br><br><h5>Addendum 9000.1:</h5> Interview with SCP-9000<br><br><h5>Interviewed:</h5> <i>SCP-9000-GPT</i><br><br><h5>Interviewer:</h5> Dr ********** [BEGIN LOG] Dr ********** sits down in a chair and turns on the tape recorder. After making sure it works correctly she says "Hello Mr 9001, my name is Doctor ************* and I would like to ask you some questions now if that's okay with you." SCP 9001 responds by saying "That's fine." Dr ********** says "Okay then, first question on my list is what do you think of these containment measures we have over you?" SCP 9001 responds by saying "They're terrible! You guys are idiots!" Dr ********** saids "Well how do we improve them then?" Then 9001 just sort of stares at her for about 1 minute before answering her question. He finally says "I guess put me in a room made out of concrete or something along those lines" Dr ******* thinks for a moment before responding by saying "….. Okay, I'm going to put that into consideration but right now I have more questions I want to ask so if your not too busy could you please answer them?" She looks over at the tape recorder which was still running as well as a stop watch sitting next to it. The time on the stop watch read 3 minutes 32 seconds since this interview had begun…<br><br><br><br><br><br><h5>Addendum9000.2:</h5> SCP-9000's most recent discovery<br><br>SCP-9000 has recently been discovered by the foundation to have a piece of paper in his pocket labeled "Diagram of how to build an explosive device that can destroy all solid matter within 1 mile radius. When opened by two highly intelligent and skilled scientists working for the Foundation itself it was found out that all they needed to make this device was C4, a [DATA EXPUNGED] and a [DATA EXPUNGED] then they simply had to connect them together using some kind of thin rope or thread like substance known as [DATA EXPUNGED]. The first scientist than asked "But what should we do about those two unidentified organ(s) inside 9001's body that are directly connected too his brain? Should we put them back in after we're done with this experiment?" The other scientist responds by saying "No, I already got rid of them yesterday when I murdered him using SCP-████." Then he turns around towards the camera and says "And it worked!" And then he turns back around towards the first scientist and says "Okay now lets get started on constructing our device…"</div>
