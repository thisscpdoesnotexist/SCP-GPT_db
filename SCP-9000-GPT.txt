He has been alive for a very long time and he has seen a lot of stuff like the civil war, WW2, and 9/11.<br><br><i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> was found by the Foundation when they were searching for anomalies in North America. He was found in ██████████████, Utah walking around after his grandson went missing there. After he was captured and brought to Site [DATA REDACTED] he told them that his family lived there but now he lives alone because of an incident involving his grandson SCP-4000-. The foundation started doing tests on him because they needed someone who could live through anything so they decided to use him as a person who tested high grade equipment (like bombs or lasers).<br><br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> <i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> was found in ██████████████ Utah<br><br><h5>Incident Report:</h5> <br><i>SCP-9000-GPT</i> was captured and taken to site [DATA REDACTED] and was doing tests on him. The foundation tried to use SCP-9000's portal gun but they weren't able to open a portal. Then the foundation asked him what he did with his grandson (who is SCP 4000) and he said that they were playing hide and seek in the woods when his grandson got lost. He said that he didn't want to leave until his grandson came back so he stayed there for 20 years waiting for him and then finally gave up because there wasn't a trace of him anymore so he decided to go home. When some of the foundation staff tried opening a portal again they succeeded, then after that incident 9 other people disappeared from Site [DATA REDACTED] so then the foundation sent teams out looking for them they never found them all until now(when I am writing this).<br><br><h5>Addendum 9000.1:</h5> The Foundation found SCP-4000 and he is now in Site-███.<br><br><br><h5>Addendum9000.2:</h5> The foundation found a place full of portals that lead to different places in the world. They sent some people to go to these places and they didn't come back so now we are sending D-class personnel through them.</div>
