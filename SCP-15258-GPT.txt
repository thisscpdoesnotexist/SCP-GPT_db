<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15258</i> is  The My First Wildfire Toy</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15258</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15258</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-17. No personnel are allowed to interact with <i>SCP-15258</i> unless given permission by Dr. ██████ or any other personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15258</i> is a toy that is a small, plastic red fire truck with stickers of various emergency vehicles and equipment on it. It has two buttons on the front of it, one saying 'FIRE' and the other saying 'RESCUE'. When both buttons are pressed at the same time, <i>SCP-15258</i> will go into an active state.<br><br>In this state, <i>SCP-15258</i> will act like a normal fire truck would in real life. However, in addition to its normal operation as a toy vehicle, <i>SCP-15258</i> also has anomalous properties that make it dangerous to humans and animals alike. When <i>SCP-15258</i> enters an active state for approximately 10 minutes after pressing both buttons at once or when left alone for more than 30 seconds after coming out of an active state by itself ,it will begin playing music from its speaker system located within its engine compartment . The music played is usually songs about wildfires or forest fires . After the song ends ,the front doors of <i>SCP-15259</i> open up and two robotic arms holding large buckets appear from behind them . These buckets are filled with what appears to be gasoline . The arms then proceed to pour the gasoline onto anything nearby using any means possible such as pouring it over people's heads ,on top of trees ,and even directly into people's mouths if they are standing close enough to them . If there is nothing nearby or if there aren't any living creatures around while doing so ,the arms instead just throw the gasoline all over themselves until they run out before returning back inside their compartment through their respective doors which then close up again afterwards . After this happens ,SCP- 15259 goes back into its inactive state where no anomalous effects occur until someone presses both buttons again at once or leaves it alone for more than 30 seconds after coming out of an active state by itself again.<br><br>SCP- 15259 was found in ██████ Park in ██████ California during a wildfire outbreak where local firefighters were deployed to contain said wildfire along with several other teams who were sent by different agencies across California including CAL FIRE (California Department Of Forestry And Fire Protection) who discovered said object during their investigation on how exactly said wildfire started despite having no witnesses claiming that they saw anyone start said fire before calling local authorities who later brought it here as evidence regarding how exactly said wildfire started without anyone being able to identify how exactly did this happen due to everyone either being killed from being burned alive or dying from smoke inhalation before firefighters arrived<br><br><h3>Addendum 15258.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████████, a firefighter who was one of the first to discover <i>SCP-15258</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-15258</i>'s discovery in order to determine how exactly did this object start the wildfire outbreak that it caused . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello █████, I see you have been transferred here from CAL FIRE for an interview regarding <i>SCP-15258</i> . How are you feeling today? █████ <br><br><b>████████: </b>Not really good , doc . I still can't believe what happened back there and how we managed to survive it all when everyone else didn't make it out alive , especially my partner who died trying to save me and the other firefighters when we were trapped under some burning trees while trying to put out said fire before it spread any further but ended up getting killed by a falling tree branch that fell on top of him while he was trying to get us out of there before more branches fell on us as well which is why we decided not go back into the forest despite being told by our superiors not too since they thought we wouldn't be able to get out alive since they believed that this wildfire would spread across California due to how fast this thing was spreading but thankfully none of them saw what happened with us or else they might have ordered everyone working on containing said wildfire at the time not too which would've resulted in more deaths along with ours if anyone had listened as well so please don't tell anyone about this because if word gets around about what happened then people might think twice about going into forests or any areas where wildfires could occur again which is why I'm telling you all this now because even though I know that no one will listen even if word does get around about what happened here ,I still want people like myself who work in places where wildfires can occur at anytime especially during summer months like right now be aware of just how dangerous these things can be and hopefully prevent others from dying like my partner did <At this point, Mr. ████████ began crying uncontrollably while holding his head down until he calmed down enough for him continue talking> <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>It's okay, everything will be alright… Now tell me everything you remember from your experience with SCP- 15259 starting from when your team discovered it until everything went black after being trapped under those burning trees . 【END LOG】 Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing Mr. ███████'s account regarding his experience with SCP - 15259, Dr. William Afton has decided not share anything regarding his interview results outside Site - 17 unless given permission by either himself or Director Rosewood so as for no one outside Site - 17 knowing anything about what really happened during said wildfire outbreak due to fear of possible widespread panic among civilians living near forests located throughout California and other states within North America should news regarding said incident were ever leaked outside Site - 17<br><br><h3>Addendum 15258.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 15258-1<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9342 and D-8102. Both subjects were equipped with breathing masks and protective clothing. They were also given a camera to document the experiment as well as a notepad to write down any observations they had during the test.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Both subjects are instructed to press both buttons on <i>SCP-15258</i> at the same time while wearing their breathing masks and protective clothing before documenting anything they notice after doing so .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After pressing both buttons at once, <i>SCP-15258</i> went into its active state whereupon it played music from its speaker system located within its engine compartment . The music played was <i>"The End Of The World"</i> by Skeeter Davis which is about a forest fire happening in California which is where said object was found in. After the song ended ,the front doors of <i>SCP-15259</i> opened up and two robotic arms holding large buckets appeared from behind them . These buckets were filled with what appeared to be gasoline . The arms then proceeded to pour the gasoline onto anything nearby using any means possible such as pouring it over people's heads ,on top of trees ,and even directly into people's mouths if they are standing close enough to them . If there is nothing nearby or if there aren't any living creatures around while doing so ,the arms instead just throw the gasoline all over themselves until they run out before returning back inside their compartment through their respective doors which then close up again afterwards . After this happened, D-9342 reported feeling nauseous for several seconds before recovering himself after taking off his breathing mask for about 30 seconds afterwards stating that he felt better afterwards . However, when asked why he felt nauseous in first place, he stated that he couldn't remember due to him being unable to remember what happened during this experiment or any other memory relating towards this event ever happening despite being able to recall everything else prior or after it occurred including how exactly said wildfire started despite having no witnesses claiming that they saw anyone start said fire before calling local authorities who later brought it here as evidence regarding how exactly said wildfire started without anyone being able to identify how exactly did this happen due</div>
