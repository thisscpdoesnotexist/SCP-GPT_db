<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21053 is  bread that makes you fat</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21053<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21053</i> is a type of bread that, when consumed, causes rapid and significant weight gain in the consumer. The bread appears to be ordinary white bread with no distinguishing features or properties.<br><br>When ingested by any living organism, the subject will experience a sudden increase in body mass within an hour of consumption. This increase can range from 5-15 kg (11-33 lbs) depending on the size and metabolism of the subject. It has been observed that subjects who consume more than one serving of <i>SCP-21053</i> will experience an even greater increase in weight gain than those who have only eaten one serving.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-21053</i> appear to be permanent; subjects who have consumed it have not been able to lose any weight gained through its consumption despite attempts at dieting and exercise. The only known way to reduce or reverse these effects is through surgical removal of fat cells, although this procedure carries its own risks and should not be attempted without medical supervision.<br><br>It is unknown how <i>SCP-21053</i> produces these effects; analysis has revealed nothing out of the ordinary about its composition or ingredients aside from its anomalous property mentioned above.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21053</i> is to be stored in a secure storage locker at Site-██. Access to the locker is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any personnel found consuming <i>SCP-21053</i> must be immediately detained and questioned about their motives for doing so, as well as any other individuals they may have shared it with. Any instances of <i>SCP-21053</i> found outside of containment are to be confiscated and destroyed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21053.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a sample of <i>SCP-21053</i> was discovered in the kitchen of an abandoned apartment building. The bread had been left out on the kitchen counter and appeared to have been consumed by at least one individual before it was discovered by Foundation personnel. Witnesses report that several individuals had been seen entering and leaving the apartment over the past few weeks, but none could be identified or located for questioning.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21053.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21053</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> D-93734, a male subject who had recently consumed <i>SCP-21053</i>.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> How did you come across <i>SCP-21053</i>?<br><b><br>D-93734:</b> I was at a bakery and saw it on the shelf. It looked like any other loaf of bread, so I bought it without thinking much about it. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> What made you decide to eat it? <br><b><br>D-93734:</b> I was hungry and thought it would make a good snack. Plus, the price was right!<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you regret eating it now? <br><b><br>D-93734:</b> Yeah, definitely. I didn't expect it to make me gain so much weight so quickly. It's really embarrassing and uncomfortable.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21053.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log-21053.3:</b> On ██/██/████, a sample of <i>SCP-21053</i> was given to D-9001, a 32 year old male with an average BMI of 22.2 kg/m2. After consuming the bread, D-9001's weight increased by 8 kg within one hour. A second sample was then provided to D-9002, a 28 year old female with an average BMI of 21.5 kg/m2; her weight increased by 11 kg within one hour after consumption. Both subjects reported feeling full and sluggish after eating the bread but no other adverse effects were observed or reported.</div>
