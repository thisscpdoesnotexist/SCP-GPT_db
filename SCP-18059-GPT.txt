It displays no anomalous properties when observed through any conventional means, however, it has been awarded <i>"employee of the month"</i> for 12 consecutive months at [REDACTED], an office supply store located in [REDACTED].<br><br>The award is given out by an anonymous source that appears to be connected to <i>SCP-18059</i>. The award consists of a certificate and a small monetary bonus which is deposited directly into the employee's bank account each month. Employees have reported feeling more motivated and productive after receiving the award, though no physical or psychological changes have been observed as a result of this effect.<br><br>When questioned about their motivation for bestowing the award on <i>SCP-18059</i>, the anonymous source simply replied <i>"It seemed like something that needed to be done."</i> No further information has been obtained regarding this statement or its implications.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18059</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-18059</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>In order to prevent further anomalous activity, all employees of [REDACTED] are to be monitored for any changes in behavior that may indicate they have become aware of <i>SCP-18059</i>'s anomalous properties. Any such individuals are to be administered Class A amnestics and transferred away from the store if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18059.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18059</i> was observed to have moved from its containment locker to the office of [REDACTED], the manager of [REDACTED]. It is unclear how <i>SCP-18059</i> managed to move itself or why it chose this particular location.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18059.2: </h3> Interview with [REDACTED]<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> [REDACTED], the store manager of [REDACTED].<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, you've been giving <i>SCP-18059</i> employee of the month for twelve months now? <br><b>[REDACTED]:</b> Yes, that's right. It's a bit strange I know, but it seemed like something that needed to be done. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any idea why? <br><b>[REDACTED]:</b> No, not really. I just felt like it was important and wanted to do something nice for this…rod? I guess that's what it is? <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any idea who might be responsible for this? <br><b>[REDACTED]:</b> No, I'm sorry. I've never seen anyone around or heard anything about it. It's all very mysterious.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18059.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-18059-1<br><b>Procedure:</b> D-18059-1 was instructed to perform a series of tasks in order to test <i>SCP-18059</i>'s anomalous properties. The tasks included organizing office supplies, filing paperwork, and other mundane activities.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After completing the assigned tasks, D-18059-1 reported feeling more energized and motivated than usual. Upon questioning, they stated that they felt as though someone else was helping them complete their work faster than normal. No physical changes were observed in the subject during or after the experiment.</div>
