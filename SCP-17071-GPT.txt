It has no discernible gender or age, and its physical form appears to be constantly shifting between various clown-like forms.<br><br><i>SCP-17071</i>'s primary anomalous effect is its ability to consume the ghosts of deceased individuals by consuming their ectoplasmic residue left behind after death. Upon doing so, <i>SCP-17071</i> will gain access to the memories and knowledge of the ghost it consumed for up to 24 hours before reverting back into its original form.

The following is a summary of the interview:<br><br><b>Dr. ███████: </b>What can you tell us about yourself?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17071</i>: </b>I am Mischief, the shape shifting clown who eats ghosts! I have been around for as long as anyone can remember, but only recently have I come out of hiding to feast on the spirits of those who have passed away. It's my way of keeping their memories alive, even if they are no longer with us physically.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17071.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/<br><br><b>20██: </b><i>SCP-17071</i> was exposed to a deceased individual’s ectoplasmic residue and subsequently gained access to the memories and knowledge of the ghost it consumed. It was observed that <i>SCP-17071</i> displayed traits similar to those of the deceased individual, such as increased intelligence, increased physical strength, and enhanced combat abilities. Following this experiment, <i>SCP-17071</i> reverted back into its original form after 24 hours.</div>
