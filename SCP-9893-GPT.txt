Due to the nature of <i>SCP-9893</i>'s anomalous properties, it is currently impossible to contain <i>SCP-9893</i> itself and as such containment procedures are focused on preventing information regarding its existence from being leaked .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9893</i> is a phenomena by which the human population of earth is predetermined to circulate between Mars and Earth. The average time for an individual to spend on Mars is approximately 2 years, with the shortest recorded time being 1 month and the longest being 5 years.<br><br>Individuals who have spent time on Mars are known as <i>SCP-9893</i>-1, and are subject to a number of anomalous effects. Firstly, they will begin experiencing vivid dreams involving an alternate reality in which they reside in a colony on Mars. These dreams will become more frequent over time until they are experienced almost exclusively while awake, at which point individuals will believe that this reality has always been their own. They will also begin to exhibit physical changes in line with those expected from long term exposure to Martian conditions (see addendum). Individuals who return from mars after 5 years or longer experience no anomalous effects upon returning home, although all individuals who have returned report feeling <i>"at home"</i> when back on Earth.<br><br><i>SCP-9893</i> was discovered following reports of several missing persons cases originating in ████████████ , China . Upon investigation it was found that these individuals had all disappeared within close proximity of each other shortly before the launch date for China's first manned mission to mars (scheduled for █/██/20██). Further investigation revealed that these individuals were part of a larger movement by Chinese citizens wishing for political reform and greater autonomy from government control . It was later discovered that many members had joined this movement due to having previously spent time living abroad during their youth (typically 2 or 3 years), most commonly in Western countries such as Canada or Australia . This led researchers investigating <i>SCP-9893</i>'s properties towards hypothesizing that it may be related towards some kind of memetic effect caused by exposure to western culture during adolescence . Further research into this possibility has proven inconclusive as there does not appear any correlation between length spent overseas and likelihood of joining the movement despite similar age profiles between those involved with both groups (see addendum). However it should be noted that once exposed subjects do not appear able recall information regarding western culture nor do they display any desire beyond wanting freedom from government control , suggesting some kind of anomalous effect rather than simple indoctrination techniques used by foreign powers against Chinese nationals .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9893.1 : </h3>中国失踪人员档案<br><br>The following is a list of individuals who have disappeared in the last 15 years and are believed to be part of <i>SCP-9893</i>. The majority of these individuals were Chinese nationals who had spent time living abroad during their youth, typically in Western countries such as Canada or Australia .<br><br><b>Name: </b>████████ ██████████ <br><br><b>Date: </b>█/██/20██ <br><br><b>Location: </b>[REDACTED], China Cause of <br><br><b>Disappearance: </b>Unknown <br><br><b>Notes: </b>Subject was a member of the Chinese dissident movement prior to their disappearance.

The interview took place shortly after their return from Mars on 12/07/20██, approximately 2 years after they had disappeared with the rest of their group.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9893</i>-1 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an excerpt from an interview conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9893</i>-1's return to Earth on 12/07/20██, approximately 2 years after they had disappeared with the rest of their group . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning Mr… uh… what was your name again? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9893</i>-1: </b>I'm sorry? My name is ██████████ . I'm not sure what you mean by that though, we've been over this before haven't we? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Yes, yes we have but… well it's just that you've been gone for quite some time now and I was wondering if there was anything else you could tell me about your time there? Anything that might be relevant to our research here at Site 17 perhaps? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9893</i>-1: </b>Well no not really… it's all pretty much the same isn't it? We did some tests in the beginning but other than that it wasn't any different to being back home really…. wait a minute why are you asking me these questions anyway?! You're supposed to be helping us! You're supposed to get us out of here! Is this some kind of joke?! (<i>SCP-9893</i> -1 begins sobbing) <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Now now calm down Mr…. uh.. erm..

My name is [REDACTED] , why does everyone keep forgetting my fucking name!? It's not like I changed or anything! God dammit look at me! Do I look familiar or something!? Why can't anyone remember who I am!? Why won't anyone help us?! We just want our freedom back!! Please help us!!

Experiment #: 9893-1<br><br>Subject(s): D-9883, one (1) male subject born and raised in ████████████ , China who had spent two (2) years living abroad during their youth in Australia. Subject was chosen due to them having no connections with any known dissident groups or political organizations. <br><br><b>Date: </b>█/██/20██ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to read a series of documents regarding Western culture and history as well as basic information regarding human rights, democracy and other concepts that are typically taught as part of Chinese primary education . After this they were asked several questions relating towards these topics before being placed into an induced coma for three days using Class A amnestics . Upon awakening, subject was questioned regarding their dreams while under sedation and whether they felt any desire to return home or not . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon awakening, subject reported experiencing vivid dreams involving an alternate reality where they had been living on Mars since childhood alongside other Chinese nationals who had lived abroad during their youth . Subject claimed that this reality felt more real than his own life on Earth despite being aware that it wasn't real upon waking up each day . When questioned about his desire to return home after reading the documents given, subject claimed he felt <i>"at home"</i> when back on Earth but did not feel any particular desire towards returning home at all aside from wanting freedom from government control , suggesting some kind anomalous effect rather than simple indoctrination techniques used by foreign powers against Chinese nationals .<br><br>Experiment Log <br><br><b>9893-2: </b>The following is a list of experiments carried out in order to determine the nature of <i>SCP-9893</i>.

When questioned about her desires after reading these documents given , she claimed that she would prefer staying there instead if given option but otherwise would prefer going back if only because <i>"she misses her family"</i> although stated that she could live there if forced too although admitted missing certain aspects such as fresh produce available locally which can't be grown easily on Mars due limited space available for growing crops compared local farms found across Victoria island colony itself along with lack availability fresh seafood available locally compared fishing industry present across Victoria Island colony itself although stated fishing industry present there isn't nearly what it once used be prior depletion fish stocks present waters surrounding island itself sometime early twenty first century according to locals themselves although stated reasons behind why aren't clear beyond general consensus believed largely related global warming leading oceans temperatures rise significantly over past decade leading native species either die off entirely or migrate elsewhere leaving them unable catch fish like salmon anymore without resorting industrial fishing methods which have led deplete fisheries further causing prices rise dramatically forcing many small scale fishermen give up profession entirely forcing many seek work elsewhere putting further strain economy already struggling deal rising unemployment rates caused largely influx emigration back mainland China mainland something locals blame Communist Party themselves rather than climate change causing issue despite high levels corruption present within local government officials themselves resulting large numbers</div>
