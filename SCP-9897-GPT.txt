<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9897</i> is a small grey cat that never sleeps.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9897</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9897</i> is to be kept in a standard animal containment cell at Site-██. It is to be fed one live pig or sheep once per week, with the exception of during testing. <i>SCP-9897</i> has shown no signs of aggression towards Foundation personnel and will not attack unless provoked or threatened.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9897</i> is a small grey cat, approximately 15 cm long. It has no observable eyes, ears, or nose. <i>SCP-9897</i> has been observed to be able to move around its enclosure despite lacking appendages or any form of locomotion.<br><br><i>SCP-9897</i> is not capable of eating solid food and must consume blood from live animals in order to survive. This can be accomplished through the use of its anomalous properties as well as using an IV drip for sustenance when no animals are available for consumption.<br><br>If <i>SCP-9897</i> does not consume at least one liter of blood daily it will become listless and cease moving entirely until it receives sustenance again. If <i>SCP-9897</i> goes without feeding for more than three days it will die instantly . This process appears to be painful for the cat as it becomes increasingly agitated and vocal with each day that passes without feeding until death occurs . Testing on D-Class personnel confirms that this process is indeed painful; however, the exact nature of this pain is unknown due to lack of any sensory organs within <i>SCP-9897</i>'s body . It should also be noted that if <i>SCP-9897</i> dies while within a host animal's digestive tract , the host animal will die instantly as well regardless if they have consumed any part of the cat yet or not . This effect extends up through multiple hosts before stopping at species with no internal organs such as arthropods (e.g., crabs) or cephalopods (e.g., octopus). It should also be noted that these effects do not occur if an instance of <i>SCP-1830</i> consumes an instance of SCP 9857 prior to death . Further research into this phenomenon is ongoing but currently suspended due to lack of funding by O5 Command pending review after Incident 9857/02/██ in which [DATA EXPUNGED]. See Addendum 2 below for details about Incident 9857/02/██<br><br><h3>Addendum 9897.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████, former owner of <i>SCP-9897</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted on 2/4/20██, one day after Incident 9857/02/██. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Good afternoon Mr. ██████, I'm sorry for the loss of your cat but we have a few questions we would like to ask you about it if that's alright with you? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Sure, go ahead and ask away but I don't know what good it'll do ya'. My little Tommy was just a regular ol' kitty cat as far as I could tell and then he just up and disappeared one day . <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Yes sir, can you tell me what happened exactly? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Well Tommy had been acting funny lately , not eating or drinking much at all so I took him to the vet to see what was wrong with him . He said that Tommy just needed some fluids in him so he hooked up an IV drip right there in the office and gave him some blood from one of those bags they use for transfusions in hospitals . Then later when I came back to pick up my cat he was gone! The nurse told me that she found him behind her desk dead with his IV still attached! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Did anything unusual happen while your cat was at the vet's office? Any people or animals come into contact with your pet at all? Mr.. <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Just this guy who came in looking for his dog; said his name was [REDACTED]. He didn't say much else other than asking where his dog got sent after being treated by the vet here . That's when they told me that my kitty had died back there too! They were really nice about it though; gave me a big box full of tissues before sending me home… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Further investigation into this man revealed no records of any living relatives or known acquaintances matching any description provided by __________ during interview (see below). It is believed that this man may have been an instance of <i>SCP-1830</i> posing as a human being but further testing is required before any conclusions can be made on this matter .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9897.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 9897.2 - Close Experiment Log 9897.2 Test #: 9897-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9897</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One D-Class personnel is to be fed a meal of live sheep, with the exception of <i>SCP-9897</i> which will be fed from an IV drip. After feeding, D-Class personnel is to have his blood drawn and placed in a separate container for analysis . Analysis will determine if any anomalous properties are present within the blood sample. <br><br><b>Results: </b>All samples drawn from D class personnel showed no signs of unusual properties or anomalies after analysis by Dr ████████. Test #: 9899-1<br><br><b>Subjects: </b><i>SCP-9897</i> and one (1) adult male pig weighing approximately 200 kg . The pig was sedated prior to testing and restrained with standard leather restraints when not being tested on directly . Testing was conducted in the same manner as test #9897-1 above, with all samples being taken from the pig instead of D class personnel . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon injection into both subjects at 10 minutes after initial injection into subject 1, subject 2 began showing signs of distress including increased heart rate, elevated temperature and increased respiration rate consistent with symptoms seen in humans suffering from shock due to severe blood loss. This continued until death occurred at 15 minutes after initial injection into subject 1 at which point all vital signs ceased within subject 2 immediately upon death of subject 1 due to [REDACTED]. At this time it should also be noted that while subjects were alive they did not appear aware that they were connected via their circulatory systems and did not attempt to escape each other's presence despite their proximity during testing (see Addendum 9897/3/b). Further tests using multiple animals are pending approval by O5 Command following review by Ethics Committee following Incident 9857/02/██ in which [DATA EXPUNGED]. See Addendum 2 below for details about Incident 9857/02/██ Test #: 9900 - Close Test #9900 Subject(s): One (1) adult female sheep weighing approximately 60 kg Procedure(s): Same as previous test except that only one instance of SCP 9857 is used instead of two instances as per previous tests Results & <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Upon injection into both subjects at 10 minutes after initial injection into subject 1 , both subjects began showing similar symptoms including increased heart rate , elevated temperature , increased respiration rate consistent with symptoms seen in humans suffering from shock due to severe blood loss . These effects continued until death occurred at 15 minutes after initial injection into subject 1 at which point all vital signs ceased within both subjects immediately upon death as per previous tests but without any sign s of physical trauma or external influence on either body postmortem aside fr om what appeared t o b e a sever ed circ ulatory system between th e tw o subj ect s w hich had been cut cleanly through without leaving any type o f mark or wound behind on either subj ect ' s skin surface indicating use o f some form o f sharp implement such as a scalpel or knife during procedure while still alive but before termination via exsanguination.
