<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24092 is  a species of hadal zone mermaid</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24092<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24092</i> is a species of mermaid native to the hadal zone of the ocean floor. It is an aquatic humanoid, approximately 2 meters in length, with a fish-like tail and four flipper-like limbs. Its skin is covered in luminescent scales that vary in color from blue to green depending on its mood.<br><br><i>SCP-24092</i> has displayed sapience and intelligence beyond what would be expected from an aquatic creature of its size. It has been observed using tools made from rocks and shells found on the ocean floor, such as spears for hunting or sticks for manipulating objects. <i>SCP-24092</i> also appears to possess some form of telepathic communication, as it has been seen conversing with other creatures living in the hadal zone without making any vocalizations.<br><br><i>SCP-24092</i>'s behavior towards humans varies greatly; while it can be friendly when approached cautiously, it will attack if provoked or threatened. Its preferred method of attack is by using its powerful tail fin to knock victims unconscious before dragging them into deeper waters where they are never seen again.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24092</i> is to be monitored by a team of researchers stationed at the hadal zone research facility. The team is to observe and document any interactions between <i>SCP-24092</i> and other creatures living in the area, as well as any changes in its behavior or habits.<br><br>In order to prevent accidental encounters with humans, all personnel entering the hadal zone must wear specialized diving suits that are designed to mask their presence from <i>SCP-24092</i>'s senses. Additionally, no attempts should be made to capture or contain <i>SCP-24092</i>; instead, researchers should focus on learning more about its behavior and ecology.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24092.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a research team encountered <i>SCP-24092</i> while conducting an exploration of the hadal zone. The mermaid was initially friendly and allowed the researchers to observe it for several hours before swimming away.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24092.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24092</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, researchers were able to establish a telepathic link with <i>SCP-24092</i> in order to conduct an interview. The following is an excerpt from the conversation:<br><b><br><i>SCP-24092</i>:</b> Why are you here? <br>We are here to learn more about you and your species. We want to better understand your behavior and ecology so that we can protect you and your habitat.<br><b><br><i>SCP-24092</i>:</b> I understand. But why do you need to protect us? <br>We want to make sure that your species is safe and secure, so that it can continue to thrive in its natural environment. We also want to make sure that humans are not a threat to your species or the hadal zone ecosystem.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24092.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 24092.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers was dispatched to the hadal zone in order to observe <i>SCP-24092</i>'s behavior and interactions with other creatures living in the area. The following is an abridged log of their findings.<br><br>• <i>SCP-24092</i> was observed hunting small fish and squid using its tail fin as a weapon. It appeared to be able to accurately target its prey even at great distances.<br><br>• When approached by researchers wearing specialized diving suits, <i>SCP-24092</i> did not react aggressively or attempt to flee; instead, it seemed curious about the divers and interacted with them in a friendly manner. It even allowed one researcher to pet it on the head before swimming away when they left the area.</div>
