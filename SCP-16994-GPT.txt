Access to <i>SCP-16994</i> is restricted only to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, as well as authorized researchers from other organizations who have signed non-disclosure agreements with the Foundation.<br><br>Any attempts by unauthorized personnel to access <i>SCP-16994</i> must be reported immediately and dealt with accordingly. All data generated by <i>SCP-16994</i> must be stored securely and not shared outside of the Foundation without prior approval from O5 Command.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16994</i> is an algorithm developed by the Foundation to predict the next Bitcoin crash. The algorithm consists of a series of complex mathematical equations, which when applied to current market data can accurately forecast when and where a Bitcoin crash will occur.<br><br>The accuracy of <i>SCP-16994</i>'s predictions is currently estimated at 80%. It has been tested on historical data and has successfully predicted every major crash in the past five years with an average lead time of three months.<br><br><i>SCP-16994</i> is programmed into a computer system located in Site ██ and monitored by personnel assigned to Project ████. Access to <i>SCP-16994</i> is restricted only to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, as well as authorized researchers from other organizations who have signed non-disclosure agreements with the Foundation.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16994.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-16994</i> predicted a Bitcoin crash to occur on ██/██/20██. On the date of the predicted crash, Foundation personnel monitored global markets and observed a sudden drop in Bitcoin prices. The accuracy of <i>SCP-16994</i>'s prediction was confirmed by O5 Command.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16994.2 : </h3>Interview with  Dr. ████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Dr. ████, Project Lead for <i>SCP-16994</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████, O5 Command Liaison<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>The algorithm is designed to predict Bitcoin crashes with a high degree of accuracy, and it seems to be doing its job quite well so far. We've been able to successfully predict every major crash in the past five years with an average lead time of three months or less.<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What do you think are the implications of this? Could it be used as a tool for investors?<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Absolutely! With this kind of predictive power at our disposal, investors could use <i>SCP-16994</i> to make informed decisions about when and where to invest their money in order to maximize profits while minimizing losses due to market volatility. Of course, there's no guarantee that any investment will pay off—but having access to such precise predictions can certainly give investors a better chance at success than they would have otherwise had without it<br><br><h3>Addendum 16994.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/<br><br><b>20██: </b>The Foundation tested <i>SCP-16994</i> on ██ different markets, including the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. All predictions made by <i>SCP-16994</i> were accurate within a margin of error of 0.1%.</div>
