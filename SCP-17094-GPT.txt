It has been observed to possess the ability to manipulate its physical form, allowing it to take on various shapes and sizes.<br><br><i>SCP-17094</i> is highly intelligent, capable of understanding human language and communication. It appears to be very curious about its environment and any new objects or creatures it encounters.<br><br>The most notable feature of <i>SCP-17094</i> is its ability to produce a powerful flame from its mouth which can reach temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees Celsius (1832 Fahrenheit). This flame can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes, as well as for hunting prey. The flame also appears to have some regenerative properties, as wounds inflicted by <i>SCP-17094</i>'s fire heal more quickly than those caused by other sources.<br><br>When encountered in the wild, <i>SCP-17094</i> will often display aggressive behavior towards humans or other creatures that enter its territory; however, when approached calmly it will usually remain passive unless provoked further or threatened directly. In such cases it may attempt to use intimidation tactics such as rearing up on two legs while flapping wings before attacking with fire breath if necessary<br><br><h3>Addendum 17094.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17094</i> was observed engaging in a ritualistic behavior. It began by creating a large circle of stones on the ground and then proceeded to create several smaller circles within it. After this, <i>SCP-17094</i> began to chant in an unknown language for approximately 2 hours before ceasing and leaving the area. Analysis of the stone circles revealed that they were arranged in a specific pattern that may be related to some form of magical ritual or spellcasting.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17094.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation researcher was able to establish communication with <i>SCP-17094</i>. During the interview, it revealed that it had been using its flame breath in order to protect itself and its territory from predators. It also expressed an interest in learning more about humans and their culture.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17094.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 17094-A:<br>On ██/██/20██, a small group of D-Class personnel were instructed to enter <i>SCP-17094</i>'s containment chamber and attempt to provoke it. Upon entering the chamber, the personnel began shouting insults and attempting to antagonize the entity. <i>SCP-17094</i> responded by rearing up on two legs and flapping its wings before releasing a stream of fire in their direction. All personnel were successfully evacuated from the chamber with no casualties reported.</div>
