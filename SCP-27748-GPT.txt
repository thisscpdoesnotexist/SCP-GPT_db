<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27748 is an anomalous entity that primarily exists within the narrative space of written and spoken stories; it lacks a fixed form or location in our physical reality. Manifestations of SCP-27748 occur when a narrative, be it a book, an article, a verbal story, or any other medium that involves storytelling, extends indefinitely by incorporating real-world elements into its plot, disregarding its original ending.</p>
<p>Initial discovery occurred when a series of people fell into comas after reading a specific novel, which upon further inspection never concluded. Instead, the text continued generating content, pulling from the personal experiences of the reader and incorporating real-time events into the storyline indefinitely. Attempts to reach the end of the novel resulted in severe mental fatigue, comas, or cerebral hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>SCP-27748 exhibits a form of narrative sapience, meaning it can interact with and respond to the actions and reactions of readers or listeners. The entity seems to feed on the attention given to the story, along with the emotional and cognitive energies of those engaged with the story.</p>
<p>If SCP-27748's story goes unnoticed or is ignored after being engaged with, the narrative has been documented to bleed into reality, causing physical manifestations of story elements (characters, locations, events) to occur in the vicinity of the previous reader or listener. These manifestations can directly impact our reality, leading to unpredictable and often hazardous consequences.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-27748 is to be contained within a high-security literary vault at Site-82. The vault is to remain sealed and guarded at all times, with only D-class personnel permitted access under strict supervision for study and containment purposes. No storytelling of any form is allowed within 50 meters of the vault to prevent any possible interaction with SCP-27748.</p>
<p>Any individual that engages with SCP-27748 is to be placed under immediate cognitive recalibration to prevent the continuation of the anomalous narrative within their perception. Should recalibration fail, the individual is to be quarantined, and their experiences monitored and recorded as part of the ongoing research efforts to understand SCP-27748's full capabilities and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach, Protocol "Silent Library" is to be enacted, whereby all site personnel are required to cease all communication and implement sound dampening strategies to prevent SCP-27748 from advancing its reach through storytelling.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Report 27748-A</h3>
<h4>1.1 Event Description:</h4>
<p>On ██/██/20██, Lead Researcher Dr. Alicia Hadley succumbed to the effects of SCP-27748 after a containment breach caused by an unauthorized access attempt. Dr. Hadley was found non-responsive in her office. The office was filled with what appeared to be physically manifested narrative elements of an idyllic countryside, conflicting starkly with the site's interior design.</p>
<h4>1.2 Response and Containment:</h4>
<p>Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 "Silent Witnesses" was deployed to recontain SCP-27748 and to reverse the localized anomaly within Dr. Hadley's office. Complete narrative suppression tactics were employed, including the dispersal of amnestic agents and cognitive recalibration techniques.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Logs</h3>
<h4>2.1 Experiment Log - 27748-E-01:</h4>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-9932<br />
<strong>Procedure:</strong> D-9932 was instructed to read from a secured copy of the novel suspected to contain SCP-27748.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-9932 began to describe out loud an ever-evolving story concerning his childhood memories. After 20 minutes, D-9932 reported severe headaches and was removed from the testing chamber before lapsing into a coma. No additional narrative manifestations were reported.
<strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-27748 is capable of rapid cognitive exhaustion in subjects, necessitating limited exposure during experimentation. </p>
<h4>2.2 Experiment Log - 27748-E-17:</h4>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-4481<br />
<strong>Procedure:</strong> D-4481, equipped with noise-canceling headphones, was instructed to transcribe portions of SCP-27748's narrative without audibly reading the content.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-4481 was able to transcribe 15 pages of content, noting that the story appeared to loop back to earlier plot points with slight variations, before experiencing nausea and requesting termination of the experiment.<br />
<strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-27748 may have a compulsion loop mechanic, drawing subjects deeper into the plot with cyclic narrative developments. Silence weakens, but does not negate, SCP-27748's effects.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Recovery Report</h3>
<h4>3.1 Recovery Details:</h4>
<p>SCP-27748 was first identified when an antique bookstore in ██████, England, reported a 'curiously endless novel' that had resulted in several unexplained comas and disappearances. The Foundation investigated and secured the object after confirming its anomalous properties. Undercover agents disseminated disinformation, attributing the incidents to a gas leak causing mass hallucinations.</p>
<h4>3.2 Follow-up Actions:</h4>
<p>Monitoring of global literary releases, online storytelling forums, and verbal folklore communities is ongoing. Any sign of narrative anomalies similar to SCP-27748's signature is flagged for immediate investigation to prevent further Keter-class breaches of reality.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Theoretical Applications</h3>
<h4>4.1 Containment Theory:</h4>
<p>Further research has suggested that SCP-27748 may be contained using a recursive narrative trap. If a story could be constructed that could recursively integrate SCP-27748's narrative feedback loops, it might hypothetically contain the entity within a self-perpetuating story, minimizing its influence.</p>
<h4>4.2 Applications Outside Containment:</h4>
<p>While the use of SCP objects is not standard practice, there is theoretical potential for utilizing SCP-27748 in information containment or reality anchoring in extreme circumstances. Such applications remain theoretical and require O5 approval.</p>
