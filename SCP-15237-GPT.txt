The Foundation investigated and found <i>SCP-15237</i> in a house where it had been kept on top of the refrigerator for two years. When questioned about <i>SCP-15237</i>, the family said that they had no knowledge of it until one day when their son climbed up on top of the fridge and found <i>SCP-15237</i> on top. The family decided to keep <i>SCP-15237</i> because their son liked playing with toys and thought he could use it as a toy for his friends if he ever had any over to play at his house, but never did because nobody ever came over anymore since finding out about how much food they were wasting whenever anyone came over for dinner or lunch or breakfast or whatever meal you can think of .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15237.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>████████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. Lachlan<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15237</i> had been discovered. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Lachlan: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████, how are you? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>I'm doing okay, I guess… why am I here? <br><br><b>Dr. Lachlan: </b>We just wanted to ask you a few questions about <i>SCP-15237</i> and how it ended up in your house. Mr. ████████ sighs and slumps down in his seat before responding with the following statement; <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Fine… what do you want to know? Dr. Lachlan pulls out a copy of the sales receipt for <i>SCP-15237</i> that was found in the house where it was discovered and hands it to Mr., who then reads it over before responding with the following statement; Mr.: Well, we bought this toy at some store called [REDACTED] when our son was born two years ago because he liked playing with toys like this when he got bored of his other ones so we thought that maybe he would use this one if we ever had any friends or family over for dinner or lunch or breakfast or whatever meal you can think of . But nobody ever came over anymore since finding out about how much food they were wasting whenever anyone came over for dinner or lunch or breakfast or whatever meal you can think of . So now it's just sitting on top of our fridge collecting dust because no one wants to eat food that doesn't exist anymore… except me, but only sometimes because I'm hungry all the time now even though I just ate like an hour ago! And my wife is always yelling at me about wasting food even though she eats more than me! She says its not fair that she has to eat less than me! But its not my fault! Its not my fault!! It's hers!! She made me do this!!! She made us all do this!!! If she hadn't gotten pregnant then none of us would have eaten any extra food ever again!! And now look at us!!! We're all fat and ugly from eating too much food every day!!!! We're never going back there again!!!!! Never!!!! Never!!!! Never!!!! Never!!!!!!!! (Mr.'s wife enters room) <br><br><b>Mrs.: </b>What did they say?! Did they tell them?! Did they tell them what happened?! They have to tell them!!!!! They have to tell them!!!!! (Mrs.'s husband stands up) <br><br><b>Mrs.: </b>Tell them what happened!!! Tell them what happened!!! Tell them what happened!!! TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED TO USSSSSS!!!!!!!! (Mrs.'s husband grabs her by her shoulders) <br><br><b>Mrs.: </b>TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED TO USSSSSS!!!!!!!! HE MADE YOU DO ITTTTTT!!!! HE MADE YOU EAT MORE FOOD THAN YOU NEEDED TOOOOO!!!!! HE MADE US ALL EAT MORE FOOD THAN WE NEEDED TOOOOOOOOO!!!!! HE DID THISDDDDDDD!!!!!!!! He did thissssssssssssss!!!!!!!! He did thiiiiiiiiis s s s s s … (Mr.'s wife collapses onto the ground unconscious as her husband begins sobbing uncontrollably.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement:: After seeing his wife collapse onto the ground from exhaustion due to overexerting herself from screaming so loudly after accusing their son of making him eat too much food every day , which caused him severe physical discomfort due to being overweight , which caused his family members also being overweight , which resulted in their son having no friends come visit him anymore since nobody wanted ot see fat people , which resulted in <i>SCP-15237</i> coming into existence due to boredom resulting from lack off activity resulting from lack off social interaction resulting from lack off social interaction resulting form lack off friends coming over since nobody wanted ot see fat people , which led into making everyone overeat leading into everyone becoming overweight leading into their son having no friends come visit him anymore since nobody wanted ot see fat people leading into making <i>SCP-15237</i> come into existence due tot he fact that kids tend t o play w i th toys w h en t hey get bo r e d o f t h e ir o ther ones lea ding int o mak ing S CP - 1 5 2 3 7 4 c<br><br><h3>Addendum 15237.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Experiment-01: </b>D-15237 was instructed to place <i>SCP-15237</i> on a table in front of her.
