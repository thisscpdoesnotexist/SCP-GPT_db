Could you tell us why you created <i>SCP-18964</i>?<br><b><br>Mr. █████:</b> Well, I wanted to create a place where thaumaturgists could come together and share their knowledge and experiences in a fun and entertaining way. I figured that by creating memes related to thaumaturgy, it would be easier for people to digest the information and retain it better than if they were simply reading about it from a book or website.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Interesting. And did you have any idea that <i>SCP-18964</i> would have anomalous effects on its viewers?<br><b><br>Mr. █████:</b> No, I had no idea.

The entity was subsequently contained and neutralized without incident.<br><b><br>Test #2:</b> Subject was exposed to multiple memes from <i>SCP-18964</i> related to manipulating eldritch energies.<br><b><br>Result:</b> Subject successfully performed a spell that allowed them to manipulate energy on a large scale, creating localized storms and other weather phenomena within their vicinity.</div>
