When any part of the item is touched, it will transmit a radio signal in Morse code corresponding to the sequence of touches. This signal can be picked up on any device capable of receiving shortwave radio signals within a range of 5 kilometers from the object.<br><br>The signal consists of a series of dots and dashes which correspond to each touch made by an individual or object. The length and strength of each dot and dash varies depending on how hard it was pressed against the fruit's surface, with harder presses resulting in longer and stronger signals than softer ones.<br><br>When touched for more than three seconds, <i>SCP-24811</i> will emit a loud screeching noise before ceasing all transmissions until it is touched again. It has been observed that touching multiple points at once results in multiple simultaneous transmissions being sent out at once, but this does not appear to have any effect on its overall functioning or performance.<br><br>The exact purpose for which <i>SCP-24811</i> was created remains unknown; however, researchers believe that it may have been used as some kind of communication device by an unknown party prior to its discovery by Foundation personnel.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24811</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to the item is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Any attempts to tamper with, damage, or otherwise interact with the object must be reported immediately and dealt with accordingly.<br><br>In the event of a containment breach, all personnel are instructed to evacuate the area immediately and contact local authorities for assistance.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24811.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-24811</i> was discovered in a warehouse in ███████, France. It had been left behind by an unknown party who had apparently used it for some kind of communication purpose prior to its discovery. Foundation personnel were able to trace the signal emitted by the object back to a location approximately 5 kilometers away from the warehouse where it was found. Further investigation revealed that this location belonged to a small research facility which had been abandoned several months before <i>SCP-24811</i>'s discovery.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24811.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24811</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a researcher attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-24811</i> by touching it in various sequences. The following is an excerpt of the conversation that ensued:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Hello? Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24811</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> I'm here to help. Do you understand?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24811</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Please answer me. I'm here to help you.<br><b><br><i>SCP-24811</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> I'm sorry, but I can't help you if you don't communicate with me.<br><b><br><i>SCP-24811</i>:</b> [No response]<br><br><h3> Addendum 24811.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-24811</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> A series of tests were conducted in order to determine the range and strength of <i>SCP-24811</i>'s signal. The results are as follows:</div>
