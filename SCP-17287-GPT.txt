It has the ability to transform into any animal it wishes, and convince others that it is from the future.<br><br>When in its natural form, <i>SCP-17287</i> speaks with an advanced level of intelligence and knowledge beyond what would be expected from a normal turtle. When questioned about its origin or purpose, <i>SCP-17287</i> will explain that it was sent back in time by an advanced race of aliens as part of an experiment to study human behavior. It claims that these aliens are monitoring humanity’s progress through time and will eventually return to judge them on their accomplishments.<br><br><i>SCP-17287</i> often attempts to manipulate those around him into believing his story by providing detailed descriptions of events which have yet to occur or convincing people that he knows personal information about them which he could not possibly know unless he were actually from the future. However, these attempts usually fail due to the fact that most individuals do not take his claims seriously or find them too fantastic to believe. <br><br>When asked why it chose this particular form for its mission, <i>SCP-17287</i> states simply “It seemed like a good idea at the time” and then refuses further comment on the matter. <br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17287</i> is to be kept in a large aquarium with a temperature of 24°C and a salinity level of 1.023. The tank should contain enough water to provide <i>SCP-17287</i> with ample swimming space, as well as several hiding places for it to retreat into when it wishes to remain undisturbed. <br><br>The aquarium should also contain several rocks and other items which <i>SCP-17287</i> can use for camouflage or shelter if necessary. A single human caretaker should be assigned to the containment chamber at all times in order to monitor <i>SCP-17287</i>’s behavior and ensure its wellbeing. <br><br>No personnel are allowed within the containment chamber without permission from the Site Director, except in cases of emergency<br><br><h3> Addendum 17287.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████ <i>SCP-17287</i> was observed attempting to escape its containment chamber by transforming into a seagull and flying away. It was quickly recaptured and returned to its tank, but not before it had managed to fly out of the Site entirely. Foundation personnel were able to track <i>SCP-17287</i> down and return it safely, but not before it had caused minor panic in the surrounding area.<br><br>Since this incident, security around <i>SCP-17287</i>’s containment chamber has been increased and all personnel entering or leaving must be accompanied by at least one guard at all times.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17287.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17287</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-17287</i> <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████ <br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt <br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me more about the aliens who sent you here? What do they look like? <br><b><i>SCP-17287</i>:</b> They are tall and slender, with four arms and two legs. Their skin is a deep blue color and their eyes glow bright yellow in the dark. They communicate telepathically, so I never heard them speak out loud. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do they have any other abilities or powers?  <br><b><i>SCP-17287</i>:</b> Yes, they are quite powerful beings with many advanced technologies at their disposal. They can travel through time, manipulate matter and energy, and even control minds if they wish. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you know why they sent you back in time? <br><b><i>SCP-17287</i>:</b> They wanted to observe human behavior over a long period of time in order to better understand us. I think they are trying to decide whether or not we are worthy of their assistance in the future. <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt <br><b>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-17287</i> refused to answer any further questions about the aliens or their motives.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17287.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> <i>SCP-17287</i> was instructed to transform into a human and interact with personnel in order to test its ability to convince people of its story. <br><b><br>Result:</b> <i>SCP-17287</i> successfully convinced two personnel that it was from the future and provided detailed descriptions of events which had yet to occur. However, when asked for proof of its claims, it refused and eventually returned to its natural form. <br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> <i>SCP-17287</i> is capable of convincing people that it is from the future, but lacks the ability or desire to provide any tangible evidence for these claims.</div>
