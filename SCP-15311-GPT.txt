What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. _________: </b>Well first of all, can you please tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15311</i>: </b>My name is ██████ ████████████ ████████████ ████████████ ██████, but my friends call me Bill! <br><br><b>Dr. _________: </b>Okay then Bill, can you tell me where did it start? <i>SCP-15311</i> looks confused as if he doesn't understand the question asked by the doctor before replying with a simple answer <i>"no"</i>. The doctor sighs before continuing with his questioning while writing down notes on a piece of paper in front of him on the desk that separates him from 15311 . He writes down <i>"lack of understanding"</i> on said paper before looking up at 15311 again . <br><br><b>Dr. _______: </b>Can you please elaborate more about that question I asked earlier? How did this all start for you ? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15311</i>: </b>Well one day I was just walking around town when suddenly out of nowhere this guy comes up to me and tells me that I'm gonna be rich if I follow him into his house , so being stupid as I am ,I followed him into his house and then everything went black after that , next thing I know there's this really bright light shining right in my eyes and when it finally goes away there's a statue standing right in front of me! And it looked like myself! So naturally thinking back then ,I came up with an idea… (At this point in time 15313 started laughing hysterically) …that'll make millions ! (<i>SCP-15313</i> stops laughing) After a few minutes pass by without any interruptions or comments from either party involved in the interview process ,the doctor decided to speak up again .Dr.(Unintelligible mumbling): Excuse me but could we get back on topic here ? You were saying something about making millions off those statues ?(Dr.(Unintelligible mumbling)) At this point in time 1531 starts laughing hysterically once more .(SCP-(Unintelligible mumbling)) After another few minutes pass by without any interruptions or comments from either party involved in the interview process once more ,the doctor decided to speak up yet again .(Dr.(Unintelligible mumbling)): Excuse me but could we get back onto topic here ? You were saying something about making millions off those statues ?(Dr.(Unintelligible mumbling)) At this point 1531 stopped laughing for good and gave an answer which seemed very well thought out at first glance but actually made no sense whatsoever upon further inspection (or lack thereof ) <i>"Yeah man ! It was easy too ! All i hadda do was go into town every night after dark walk around until i find someone who looks like they're alone then turn them into stone!"</i> At this point even though he didn't realize it himself 1531 began talking very fastly as if trying not forget anything important while also trying not let anyone else forget anything important either <i>"Then i would take their statue home along with some other stuff like their clothes money jewelry whatever else they had on em' because everyone knows its better to take everything than just leave them naked don't ya think?"</i> After giving an answer which seemed very well thought out at first glance but actually made no sense whatsoever upon further inspection (or lack thereof ) 1531 started talking very fastly as if trying not forget anything important while also trying not let anyone else forget anything important either <i>"Then i would sell their statue along with some other stuff like their clothes money jewelry whatever else they had on em' because everyone knows its better to take everything than just leave them naked don't ya think?"</i> The doctors expression changed drastically during these last few sentences going from neutral face showing interest towards subject matter being discussed during conversation towards face showing disgust towards subject matter being discussed during conversation .
