I am here to ask you some questions about your life before you were contained by the foundation, is that alright? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14572</i>: </b>Yes, it is fine with me if it will help me get out of this place faster. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then, my first question is how did you come into possession of the mask? <i>SCP-14572</i> sighs and puts her head down as she speaks in a sad tone of voice. <br><br><b><i>SCP-14572</i>: </b>I found the mask in an old mansion on top of a hill near my house when I was walking home from school one day…when I put on the mask…I heard a voice inside my head say <i>"I have chosen you to be mine forever"</i>…then everything went dark and when I woke up…I was wearing this dress and holding this knife…and there were all these bodies around me with their throats cut open…and blood everywhere….I didn't know what happened or why but ever since that day people started calling me <i>"The Weeping Bride"</i> because they thought it had something to do with weddings but they are wrong! It's not because of weddings at all! It's because that thing made me kill people! And now everyone thinks its funny to call me that and laugh at me for being a murderer even though I didn't mean for any of those things to happen! Dr. ██████ pauses for a moment before continuing his questioning <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing the interview transcript, we have concluded that 《<i>SCP-14572</i>》is not dangerous unless someone wears it's mask which seems to be able to control anyone who wears it so we must keep 《<i>SCP-14572</i>》in soundproof containment cell for safety reasons until further notice<br><br><h3>Addendum 14572.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 14572-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14572, a Class D personnel.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is to enter <i>SCP-14572</i>'s cell and observe it. After that, subject is to exit the cell and wait for 10 minutes before entering again. The subject is then to observe <i>SCP-14572</i> again. This procedure will be repeated 3 times. Then, the subject will be asked about his observations of <i>SCP-14572</i> and how he feels about it after being exposed for a long period of time. The subject was also given an audio recorder to record his thoughts during the experiment if he wishes to do so.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject entered <i>SCP-14572</i>'s cell at 11:30 AM on ██/██/████ and observed it for 5 minutes before exiting the room at 11:35 AM on ██/██/████ . At 11:40 AM on ██/██/████ , the subject reentered <i>SCP-14572</i>'s cell but left immediately afterwards due to fear of being attacked by <i>SCP-14572</i> . The experiment was concluded at this point because no more testing can be done with Class D personnel who are afraid of entering or interacting with any SCPs in general due to their low mental stability rating .<br><br></div>
