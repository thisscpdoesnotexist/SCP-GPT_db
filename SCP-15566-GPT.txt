It's so cool! Can I keep it? Please? Pleasepleasepleaseplease?!<br><br><b>Dr. Gerald: </b>No way! It's too dangerous to be used by anyone other than myself or any other Level 4 personnel! You could have been seriously injured if you had tried using that thing on yourself! Have you ever heard of something called <i>"the human body"</i>? If someone cuts themselves with that thing they'll probably die instantly! And what if someone else got a hold of this thing and decided to use it on you!? You'd probably end up dead as well! That is why we are keeping this object under lock and key for all eternity until we find out how exactly does it work or until we can figure out how to destroy this object safely without causing any damage to our own bodies or those of others around us who might find themselves in possession of such an object like yourself… Now please leave me alone so that I can continue my research into this mysterious anomaly… This interview is over now, thank you very much for your cooperation today Mr… Mr…. Uh.. What did you say your name was again?<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15566.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 15566-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2391, a 32 year old female.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to attempt to cut <i>SCP-15566</i> with a scalpel.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-2391 was unable to cut <i>SCP-15566</i>.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Further testing is required. - Dr. ██████ Experiment Log <br><br><b>15566-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2391, a 32 year old female. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to attempt to cut <i>SCP-15566</i> with an axe . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject was able to damage <i>SCP-15566</i>'s blade but not able to cut it completely off of its handle . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Further testing is required . - Dr. ██████ Experiment Log 15566 - 3: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 2391 , a 32 year old female . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A piece of paper measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 0 . 5 mm in thickness and weighing 2 grams was placed on top of SCP - 155 66 's blade while the knife floated in the air above it and then measured for any changes in mass or volume before and after being subjected to various forces such as heat , cold , pressure etcetera for up t o 20 minutes each time using high precision equipment such as an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) which uses forces that are 10 times smaller than those from the weight of a single atom and can measure surface roughness down t o one ten thousandth of one nanometer ( 10 nm ) or about 100 atoms across per inch ( 100 / in ). <br><br><b>Results: </b>The paper showed no change at all before and after being subjected t o various forces except for when exposed t o extreme heat where it showed signs of melting at temperatures higher than 1000 ° C ( 1800 ° F ) which caused it t o be destroyed by the heat since there were no means available at Site 19 t o cool down any object that hot within 20 minutes so this test had been stopped at 1000 ° C ( 1800 ° F ). <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that there are certain conditions under which objects can be destroyed by extreme heats but they must be cooled down quickly enough afterwards otherwise they will just burn up like normal paper would do under similar circumstances without ever melting first unless kept below 500°C(932°F) then some materials may melt instead such as aluminum if cooled slowly enough over several hours though if cooled quickly enough like this then even aluminum will not melt until reaching 1200°C(2192°F). This seems consistent with what we know about how matter works normally so perhaps there is something else going on here beyond our current understanding because we have never seen anything like this before nor have we ever heard anything about anyone else seeing anything like this either so far where objects appear capable of resisting extremely high temperatures without actually melting or evaporating until they reach very high temperatures well beyond those found naturally anywhere on Earth while still remaining intact even though they clearly would have melted long ago if they were made out of normal materials instead except when exposed only briefly or indirectly through brief contact rather than direct exposure due to their apparent ability somehow resist extremely high heats much better than any known material could possibly do normally under similar circumstances based upon what we know currently about how matter works normally except when exposed only briefly or indirectly through brief contact rather than direct exposure due to their apparent ability somehow resist extremely high heats much better than any known material could possibly do normally under similar circumstances based upon what we know currently about how matter works normally during normal conditions where temperature ranges from 0°C(32°F) up t o around 400°C(752°F) where most materials start showing signs melting when heated above around 300ºC(572ºF) but not necessarily instantly unless kept hotter longer while some can remain solid all the way up into higher ranges between 600ºC(1112ºF)and 800ºC(1472ºF) depending upon their composition etcetera though most materials start showing signs melting somewhere between 200¡ã400¡ã600¡ã800 º C depending upon their composition etcetera but nothing remains solid indefinitely once heated past 900 º C even if cooled slowly over many hours because everything eventually melts eventually once heated past 900 º C no mater what unless kept colder longer although some substances may remain solid longer depending upon their composition etcetera including metals up into higher ranges between 1000 º C 2000 º C 3000 º c 4000 ª</div>
