<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17146 is  a Tabletop Simulator</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17146<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17146</i> is a Tabletop Simulator, an electronic game developed by Berserk Games. The object appears to be a standard version of the game, however all attempts to interact with it have been met with failure.<br><br>When powered on, <i>SCP-17146</i> will display a randomly generated boardgame layout and ruleset for each individual instance of use. These rulesets are always highly complex and often contain elements that defy known physical laws or common sense. Additionally, any attempt at playing the game will result in unpredictable outcomes and events which can range from minor inconveniences to catastrophic consequences on both the local environment and beyond depending on the scope of play.<br><br>Due to its unpredictable nature, <i>SCP-17146</i> has been contained in a secure chamber at Site ██ since its discovery in 20██. Any personnel attempting to interact with <i>SCP-17146</i> must do so under strict supervision as per containment protocol 17146/1B.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17146</i> is to be contained in a secure chamber at Site ██. Access to the chamber is restricted and requires Level 4 clearance. All personnel attempting to interact with <i>SCP-17146</i> must do so under strict supervision as per containment protocol 17146/1B.<br><br>Any attempts at playing the game are strictly forbidden, and all personnel interacting with <i>SCP-17146</i> must wear protective gear at all times. Additionally, any anomalous events or phenomena resulting from interaction with <i>SCP-17146</i> must be reported immediately to the Site Director for further investigation and containment procedures if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17146.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site ██ when personnel attempted to play <i>SCP-17146</i> without supervision. The resulting events caused extensive damage to the surrounding area and resulted in the death of █ personnel. Following this incident, all attempts at playing <i>SCP-17146</i> are strictly forbidden and any anomalous events or phenomena resulting from interaction with <i>SCP-17146</i> must be reported immediately to the Site Director for further investigation and containment procedures if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17146.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> So, what can you tell me about <i>SCP-17146</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher █████:</b> Well, it's a Tabletop Simulator that appears to be capable of generating random boardgame layouts and rulesets with unpredictable outcomes and events. We've been unable to interact with it in any meaningful way so far, but we're still trying to figure out how it works.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17146.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment 17146-A:</b> On ██/██/20██, two D-Class personnel were allowed to interact with <i>SCP-17146</i> under strict supervision. Upon setting up the game, the board was populated with pieces representing various supernatural entities and forces. The ruleset for this instance of play was highly complex and difficult to follow. After approximately one hour of play, both D-Class personnel began displaying symptoms consistent with intense fear and paranoia. Both subjects were immediately removed from the chamber and administered Class A amnestics before being released back into Foundation custody.</div>
