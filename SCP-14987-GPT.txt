If you are hungry , <i>SCP-14987</i> will open up and allow food or liquid into your mouth . If someone wants to kiss you, they can kiss <i>SCP-14987</i> instead of your actual lips.<br><br><i>SCP-14987</i> was discovered by Agent ████████ in [DATA EXPUNGED] after he noticed that his co workers were not using their faces while working at their desks. He then took a closer look at his own face and noticed that he was also not using it while working at his desk. After several months of research, Agent ████████ figured out how to remove <i>SCP-14987</i> from his own face without causing any harm or discomfort (see Addendum 14987a). He then proceeded to remove all the other faces from everyone else's faces in the office building (see Addendum 149871). The Foundation was notified when Agent ████████ tried removing all the faces off people walking down the street outside of the office building (see Addendum 149872). When asked why he did this, Agent ████████ replied <i>"because I could"</i>. All personnel who have come into contact with <i>SCP-14987</i> are now considered Level 1 personnel under Protocol Omega 6 (<i>"I Could"</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 14987.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ███████ (<i>SCP-14987</i>'s creator)<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Bright </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted one month after the discovery of <i>SCP-14987</i> by Agent ████████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Bright: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████, my name is Dr. Bright and I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-14987</i>. <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Okay… <br><br><b>Dr. Bright: </b>What exactly is <i>SCP-14987</i>? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>It's a part of your face that you can remove without any harm or discomfort to yourself or others around you, but it will always return back to its original position within one hour of removal and can be used to do things that you would normally do with your face if it was there like talking or eating food or kissing people instead of your actual lips . Dr.: And how did this come into existence? Mr.: Well… uh… I don't really know how it came into existence, but I remember creating it in my basement lab on the night before the day that Agent ████████ discovered it at work . It all started when I was trying to create a new type of plastic that could never wear out or break down over time so people would have something nice and durable for their furniture and floors in their homes instead of having them replaced every couple years because they were broken from using them too much . So anyway, after months and months worth of hard work , I finally created this new type plastic called <i>"Eternaplastic"</i> which means <i>"eternal plastic"</i> because if someone accidentally drops an object made out Eternaplastic on the floor , then picks up the object off the floor without realizing there are cracks in its surface , then accidentally drops said object again on an even harder surface such as concrete then picks up said object off said concrete again without noticing more cracks have appeared in its surface , then repeats this process over and over again for several years straight until eventually all surfaces are covered with cracks from dropping Eternaplastic objects on them repeatedly for several years straight except for one small area where no cracks could be found anywhere no matter what kind of hard surfaces were dropped Eternaplastic objects onto including concrete which makes sense because if something dropped onto a hard surface enough times eventually all surfaces will get cracked so dropping an object made out Eternaplastic onto a harder surface once should produce only 1 crack meaning there should only be 1 crack somewhere on any given hard surface meaning there should only be 1 crack somewhere on any given Eternaplastic object since they're made out entirely from this new type plastic called <i>"Eternaplastic"</i> which means <i>"eternal plastic"</i> because if someone accidentally drops an object made out completely from this new type plastic called <i>"Eternaplastic"</i> onto a harder surface such as concrete then picks up said object off said concrete without noticing any cracks anywhere no matter what kind of light source is being used including black lights which make sense considering black lights produce invisible ultraviolet light rays invisible to human eyesight but not invisible to cameras since cameras use infrared light rays invisible to human eyesight instead so infrared light rays produced by black lights would not affect anything coated completely with this new type plastic called <i>"Eter-"</i> <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing about how his creation came into existence, Doctor Bright decided not question him further regarding his creation due him being extremely tired at the time due him working nonstop ever since he created <i>SCP-14987</i> trying figure out why he created it in first place (see Addendum 149871).<br><br><h3>Addendum 14987.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 14987-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14987, Agent ████████.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-14987 is to remove <i>SCP-14987</i> from his face without using a sharp object.
