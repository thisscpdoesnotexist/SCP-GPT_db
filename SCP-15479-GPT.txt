It flies at an average speed of 10 meters per second (32 km/h).<br><br><i>SCP-15479</i> was first discovered by Agent ██████ in 19██ when he was going to his friends house to celebrate halloween together with him, but when he arrived there he noticed that his friend wasn't home yet so he decided to wait for him outside his house until he arrived home. After waiting for about 30 minutes Agent ██████ heard some strange noises coming from above him so he looked up at the sky where <i>SCP-15479</i> was flying around above him shooting its cannons at random houses in [REDACTED] street causing them to explode into flames . Agent ██████ then contacted MTF Epsilon-11 (<i>"Neighborhood Watch"</i>) who managed to capture <i>SCP-15479</i> after several hours of fighting against it using their fighter jets . After capturing <i>SCP-15479</i> they transported it into Site 11 where they contained it inside a hangar located inside Site 11 .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15479.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ████████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-15479</i>'s captain, ██████ ████████.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. █████████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was performed after <i>SCP-15479</i> was captured by MTF Epsilon-11. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello Mr… Captain?
