The following is a transcript of the <br><br><b>interview: </b>Researcher Jameson:<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15240</i> is a phenomenon that occurs at the end of every broadcast day on the Las Vegas, Nevada television station KTNV-56. The last segment of each broadcast day will begin normally, with a typical news program or other program being shown. At approximately 8:43 PM (local time), the audio and video will cut out for approximately five seconds before returning to normal. Approximately ten seconds later, all non-essential personnel in the studio will disappear; however, this effect does not occur if there are no non-essential personnel present in the studio at that time.<br><br>After another twenty seconds have passed since this event occurs, all remaining personnel in the studio will vanish as well; however, this effect does not occur if there are no remaining personnel present in the studio at that time. All video and audio feeds from within KTNV-56's studios will cease to function after sixty minutes have passed since these events occur; however, this effect does not occur if there are no video or audio feeds from within KTNV-56's studios present at that time. At exactly 9:04 PM (local time), <i>SCP-15240</i>'s effects end and normal programming resumes until 5:00 AM (local time) when it repeats itself again.<br><br><i>SCP-15240</i> was discovered on ██/██/20██ when Foundation agents embedded within local law enforcement agencies were alerted by reports of missing persons filed by family members of employees working for KTNV-56 during its nightly sign offs . Agents embedded within local law enforcement agencies investigated these reports and discovered several individuals who had gone missing during <i>SCP-15240</i>'s effects . All individuals affected by SCP 15240 were found outside their homes with their eyes closed . They appeared to be sleeping , but did not wake up even after loud noises were made near them . These individuals had been outside for an extended period of time without any form of protection from environmental hazards such as extreme heat or cold . When questioned about why they remained outside , most affected individuals claimed they <i>"couldn't go back inside"</i> due to feeling <i>"trapped"</i> inside their homes despite having left them willingly earlier on during regular programming hours . Other affected individuals claimed they <i>"couldn't move"</i> despite being able to walk normally prior to disappearing during SCP 1524 0' s e ffects ; these indivi duals could still speak but only gave nonsensical answers when questioned about why they didn't try moving away from where they disappeared into places where it would<br><br><h3>Addendum 15240.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, a former employee of KTNV-56<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Researcher Jameson </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on ██/██/20██, shortly after Foundation agents embedded within local law enforcement agencies found █████ █████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b>Hello Mr. █████. I'm here to ask you some questions about what happened to you today . Can you tell me what happened?<br><br>Mr. █████ appears confused for several seconds before responding . <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>What do you mean? Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b>You were reported missing by your family earlier today . They said they last saw y ou before y ou disappeared from their home during the nightly sign off at KTNV-56 . <br><br><b>Mr. █████████: </b>Oh yeah , that's right ! I remember now! I was watching TV and then it just went black ! But it came back on after a few seconds! That's when all the lights in my house went out too , but they came back on again after a few seconds too ! Then the TV just started playing its regular programming again and everything was fine ! Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b>What do you mean by <i>"everything was fine"</i> ? <br><br><b>Mr. █████████: </b>Well , nothing really changed except for how long we had to wait for everything to come back on again! It used to be like that sometimes when our power would go out at night but we'd have it fixed pretty quickly so we wouldn't miss anything important ; but this time it took longer than usual so I got worried and called my wife over to check if everything was okay with our power or something like that; she said she couldn't see anything wrong with our power or any of our appliances so she told me not worry about it and go back inside; but then when I tried going inside , something weird happened! Like…I don't know how else to describe it other than saying <i>"it felt like there wasn't enough room"</i> in my house even though there clearly should've been enough room since nothing had changed since earlier that evening ; if anything, there should've been more room since no one else besides me lived in my house! It felt really weird trying going into the door because of how crowded things seemed even though no one else was there with me ; so instead of going through the door, I decided instead just walked around outside until your people showed up looking for me . After hearing what he described as happening during SCP 15240's effects, Researcher Jameson asked him several questions regarding his experience during SCP 15240's effects (see Addendum 15240-4). <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview, ████████ has been classified as an affected individual due to experiencing SCP 15240's effects firsthand despite not working at KTNV-56 prior to being interviewed by Foundation personnel . He is currently being held at Site-56 while arrangements are made regarding his containment alongside other affected individuals who have experienced SCP 1524 0' s e ffects firsthand as well as those who have only heard stories about them from others (see Addendum 15240 -5)<br><br><h3>Addendum 15240.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15240-1:<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> On ██/██/20██, Researcher Jameson was granted permission to enter KTNV-56's studios in order to observe <i>SCP-15240</i> first hand. The following is an audio transcript of the events that transpired during this experiment. Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"Hello? Is anyone here?"</i> (No response) Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"I'm coming in."</i> (Researcher Jameson enters the studio and closes the door behind him.) Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"Hello? Can anyone hear me?"</i> (No response) Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"This is Agent [REDACTED] with the Foundation . I need you to tell me where you are so we can get you out of there."</i> (Researcher Jameson waits for a response, but none comes.) Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"Sir, if you can hear me , please move your legs or arms or anything so I know that you're still alive ."</i> (Still no response from any affected personnel .) Researcher <br><br><b>Jameson: </b><i>"[EXPLETIVE REDACTED]! Alright then , let's try something else ."</i><br><br>(After approximately ten seconds have passed since these events occur , all remaining personnel in the studio vanish and video and audio feeds cease functioning . ) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After review by O5 Council members, it was decided that further experimentation on SCP 15240 would be unnecessary due to its effects being easily replicated by testing D-Class personnel under similar conditions. -Dr. Saito</div>
