All personnel are to be equipped with flamethrowers and instructed to use them if <i>SCP-15573</i> attempts to attack them.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15573</i> is a large, sapient, and extremely hostile reptile that has been sighted in the wilds of ██████. It appears to be made of an unknown material that is resistant to most forms of damage. <i>SCP-15573</i> has displayed the ability to alter its physical form at will, taking on the appearance and abilities of various species of reptile.<br><br><i>SCP-15573</i> was first discovered by Dr. ████████ while on a nature walk through ███████████ National Park in [REDACTED]. While observing a group of [REDACTED] (a species native to ██████) nearby, <i>SCP-15573</i> attacked her. After being severely injured during the attack, she was able to escape back into town and report what had happened before dying from blood loss. A team was sent out immediately but were unable to locate it before it disappeared into the woods again.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15573.2 : </h3>Interview with 김영민 (Kim Yeong-Min)<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> 김영민 (Kim Yeong-Min, Park Ranger for ███████████ National Park) </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Mr. Kim was reported missing after the attack on Dr. ████████ and was found by Foundation personnel 2 weeks later in a small town nearby. He appeared to be suffering from some form of amnesia and could not remember anything that happened during the time between his disappearance and being found by Foundation personnel. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Hello, my name is Doctor ████████, I'm with the SCP Foundation and I'd like to ask you a few questions if that's alright with you? Mr. Kim looks at her uncomfortably for a moment before responding Mr. Kim: Sure… why not? I don't have anywhere else to be right now anyways… What do you want to know? Dr. ████████ takes out her clipboard and begins writing down notes while speaking <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Well first off we'd like to know what happened when you were attacked by <i>SCP-15573</i> two weeks ago… Mr Kim pauses for a moment before responding Mr Kim: It's all kind of fuzzy but I remember it attacking me while I was observing some [REDACTED] in the woods near here… then it just disappeared into thin air after injuring me pretty badly… After that everything went black until about two weeks later when those guys showed up looking for me at my house... He points towards Agent Lee who nods back at him in acknowledgement before continuing questioning Dr Kim looks confusedly at Agent Lee as he speaks again Agent Lee You mean your wife didn't tell you about us coming by your house looking for you? She said she told everyone in town about us coming around asking if anyone had seen or heard from you recently….<br><br>Mr Kim shakes his head slowly as he responds No, she didn't mention anything about any guys showing up looking for me.. But then again we haven't really talked much since our son died last year..<br><br>Dr Koh frowns slightly as she scribbles something down on her clipboard while speaking Oh yes, we're very sorry to hear that.. We lost someone close too so we understand how hard things can be sometimes.. How did he die exactly?<br><br>Mr kim pauses briefly before responding Well it was pretty sudden actually…. He took ill one day and died just hours later without ever waking back up from his sleep.. It took us all completely off guard because he seemed perfectly fine earlier that day when we were eating breakfast together….. Then suddenly he got sick right there during breakfast…. And then hours later he was dead….. The doctor nods slowly while writing something else down on her clipboard before speaking again Do either of your parents live around here still? Or any other family members perhaps?<br><br>Mr kim shakes his head slowly as he responds No not anymore…. They all passed away years ago except my wife's father but even him moved away years ago after grandma died…… My wife never really got along with him anyways so it wasn't surprising when they stopped talking after grandma passed away…… She always said they didn't get along because they had different ideals growing up or something like that but whatever their reasons were doesn't matter anymore now does it…… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview ended agent lee began asking mr kim more questions regarding what happened during the time between his disappearance and reappearance 2 weeks ago which resulted in mr kim becoming increasingly agitated until finally snapping at agent lee saying <i>"I already told ya everything i know! Now leave me alone!"</i> After this outburst agents lee & fernandes escorted mr kim back home whereupon agents fernandes & chan entered into an argument with mrs kim regarding whether or not she had informed them of their husbands whereabouts leading them both out onto their front lawn whereupon Mrs kims began yelling profanities at both agents fernandes & chan resulting in neighbors calling 911 due to hearing gunshots fired outside shortly thereafter dispatch sent police officers over who upon arrival discovered both agents fernandes & chan dead along with Mrs KIM deceased inside their home having apparently shot herself through the mouth using an unregistered handgun belonging to her husband which prompted an immediate lockdown of the area surrounding their home due<br><br><h3>Addendum 15573.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br>Subject(s): D-15573, <i>SCP-15573</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15573 is instructed to approach <i>SCP-15573</i>. Both are outfitted with a radio transmitter and camera. <br><br><b>Results: </b>D-15573 approaches <i>SCP-15573</i> and attempts to communicate with it. It does not respond, but the video feed shows it changing its form to resemble that of a [REDACTED]. After several minutes of this, the feed cuts out suddenly. When contact is reestablished, audio only, D-15574 claims that SCP- 15573 has attacked him and broken his neck before disappearing again. Test #: 2<br><br>Subject(s): A team of 5 agents armed with flamethrowers. (Note from Dr <br><br><b>████████: </b><i>"I know what you're thinking but we have no idea how resistant this thing's skin is so I don't want anyone getting close enough for it to touch them."</i>) <br><br><b>Results: </b>Agents enter cell and open fire on SCP- 15573 as soon as they see it in its original form (a large lizard). It does not appear injured by their flamethrowers at all but begins moving towards them rapidly despite still being on fire. As soon as one agent makes physical contact with it his body begins rapidly transforming into another reptile species before collapsing into a pile of ash . The remaining agents attempt retreat but are unable to get past the door before being attacked by what appears to be an amalgamation of all species seen so far including their own . All agents die in the resulting chaos except for Agent █████ who manages to escape through the air ducts after severing his arm at the elbow which he then throws down onto one of the creatures below him causing an explosion which kills multiple specimens . He then proceeds out through another air duct where he meets up with Agent ████ who was sent back inside after losing contact during initial attack along with two other agents (Agent ███████ & Agent █████████) who had also managed escape during attack and were waiting outside airduct entrance for rescue . All three attempt escape together using additional airducts leading away from facility however they are attacked once more by unknown number specimens while crawling though tunnel leading outside facility at time unknown while recording video feed on cell phone camera attached first agent's belt looped around second agent's wrist . They manage kill off several specimens using firearms however running low on ammo when suddenly first agent spots light coming from end tunnel ahead indicating possible exit point , however upon exiting tunnel quickly realize this was mistake when see group specimen waiting outside exit point along side two other specimen resembling previously seen specimen only larger size approximately 3 meters long each , plus numerous smaller specimens estimated size between 30cm - 50cm long each , all surrounding group members except for third agent who had been killed by small specimens earlier during journey through tunnels later identified as juvenile forms or possibly offspring produced by adult forms due to lack any observed reproduction methods among known members species encountered thus far .
