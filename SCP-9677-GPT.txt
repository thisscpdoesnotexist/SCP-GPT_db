Could you please state your name?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9677</i>:</b> My name is Albert Einstein, but everyone calls me Grandpa Al! How are you doing today? You look like a nice guy! Are you married? Do you have any kids? If not, why not?! It's never too late to find love! Oh, I'm sorry for being so nosy! I'm just a bit curious about life outside of my dimension… So what do they call me here anyways? What am I famous for in this world?!<br><br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> You're known as Albert Einstein in this world and we found out that you were a famous scientist in our world as well… We don't know how or why but it seems that there are multiple versions of yourself across multiple dimensions… But back to the topic at hand; we found out that you were involved with the creation of some anomalous objects such as SCP-███ and SCP-███ . We also know that these objects were created by using an anomalous device called <i>"The Portal Gun"</i>. Would you mind telling us more about these devices and how they work exactly? And could we see them if possible?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9677</i>:</b> The portal gun was created by myself along with other scientists during World War II to help us escape from Nazi Germany when things got rough for us there… It was made from parts of an old radio set so it can only create portals between two places where there's a radio set present at both ends… As for those other objects; they were all made by myself alone while working on my doctorate degree at Princeton University during the 1920s…. They're all very interesting devices indeed…. But if I may ask; what do those devices do exactly anyway!? They sound very dangerous indeed…. Why did they need to be contained!? Is it because they can cause damage or harm people!? Or maybe even worse than that!? Oh dear…. That sounds terrible indeed….. Well then, let me ask another question instead; what happens after someone uses one of those devices on themselves!? Do they end up somewhere else entirely or does something bad happen to them instead!? Please tell me more about this!!<br><br><h3><br><br><b>Addendum 9677.2 :</b></h3> Interview Log<br><br><b><br><br><b>Interviewed:</b>  <i>SCP-9677</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer:</b>  Dr. ██████ </b> <br><br><b> Foreword:</b> The following is an interview between <i>SCP-9677</i> and Dr. ██████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><blockquote class='blockquote'><br><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-9677</i>,<br><br><b> I am here to ask you some questions about yourself and your grandson. <i>SCP-9677</i>:</b> Oh, hello there!
