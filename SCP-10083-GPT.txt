In order to prevent anyone from entering <i>SCP-10083</i>, a large sign has been placed in front of its entrance stating that it is private property and that trespassing will result in legal action being taken against them.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10083</i> is a labyrinth that has been discovered inside of the walls of a house in ████████, California. The labyrinth is only accessible through an entrance on the first floor, and cannot be accessed from any other point in the house.<br><br>The walls of <i>SCP-10083</i> are made out of concrete and are about 1 meter thick. The labyrinth itself consists of 3 floors and 10 rooms that have been carved out by hand. There are no windows or doors to access these rooms except for one room on each floor (the entrances to these rooms can be found on the exterior wall). All 10 rooms have a door leading outside to different locations throughout ████████, California.<br><br><i>SCP-10083</i> was discovered by local law enforcement after reports were filed regarding several missing persons who had last been seen entering <i>SCP-10083</i>'s entrance before they disappeared completely without a trace. SCP personnel were sent to investigate after it was confirmed that there was no way for anyone to exit the building through any other means than going through <i>SCP-10083</i> itself (see addendum 10083a). After further investigation into this phenomenon, it was concluded that all missing people who entered <i>SCP-10083</i> never exited due to them being unable or unwilling to find their way out again (see addendum 10083b). It should also be noted that all missing people were reported as having gone insane shortly before disappearing completely from sight with no explanation as for why this happened provided by anyone who knew them well enough beforehand . In order for anyone inside <i>SCP-10083</i>'s interior not become lost forever , they must leave via one of its exits located at least once every 24 hours . Otherwise , they will become part of its permanent population .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10083.1 : </h3> ██/██/████:<br><br>The following is an interview with Dr. █████, who was sent to investigate <i>SCP-10083</i> after reports of missing persons were filed. The interview was conducted by Agent ██████ at the entrance of <i>SCP-10083</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview took place before any personnel entered <i>SCP-10083</i>'s interior in order to confirm if it truly existed and what it looked like inside . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>What exactly are you looking for here? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>We've received several reports that people have been going missing around this area lately, so I'm here to investigate whether or not there's anything unusual about this house that might be causing them to disappear . Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>So you're saying there are no signs of forced entry into the house? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>No, none at all . It looks like they just walked in through the front door and disappeared without a trace . Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>And you're sure that nothing was taken from them either? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>We can't be completely sure about that since we don't know what happened to their belongings , but judging from their last known locations , it looks like they had everything on them when they disappeared . They weren't robbed or anything like that either according to witnesses who saw them last before they went missing . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>All further investigation regarding these disappearances were halted due to lack of evidence pointing towards any possible suspects involved in these cases (see addendum 10083b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10083.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, a resident of ████████, California:<br><br>The following is an interview with █████ █████, who was one of the first people to enter <i>SCP-10083</i> after it was discovered. The interview took place on █/██/20██ at Site-19 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. V████████: </b>Hello there, Mr. █████ . I'm here to ask you some questions about what happened when you went inside of <i>SCP-10083</i> last month . Please state your name and occupation for the record . <br><br><b>█████: </b>Uh… my name is █████ █████ and I'm a construction worker by trade , but I live in this house with my family so that they can go to school around here while I work on various construction sites throughout the city . <br><br><b>Dr. V████████: </b>How long have you lived in this house? <br><br><b>█████: </b>About five years now , ever since we moved out from our old home in Sacramento after my wife got accepted into a local college nearby here . <br><br><b>Dr. V████████: </b>So why exactly did you decide to enter <i>SCP-10083</i>? Were you curious about it or something? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well , yeah… But not because I thought there was anything unusual about it or anything like that though ! It's just that one day when me and my wife were walking past its entrance while taking our daughter back home from school , she asked me if she could go inside since she had never seen anything like it before in her life before then (she's only six years old) so we decided to let her go ahead and explore it for a bit while we waited outside for her right next to its entrance where we could still see her through the window on the door leading into <i>SCP-10083</i>'s first floor room (the room located at the very top of all three floors). After waiting for about twenty minutes without seeing any signs of movement from within , we started getting worried so me and my wife went inside together only to find out that our daughter had disappeared completely without leaving any traces behind as if she had never been there at all ! We looked everywhere inside this labyrinth but couldn't find any trace of her anywhere ! That's why we called local law enforcement afterwards who then sent their officers over here too until they found nothing either as well which is how they ended up calling us again asking us whether or not anyone else might have gone missing around these parts recently which made us think back on what happened earlier today when our daughter disappeared suddenly like that! That's how all these reports came up! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing Mr. ███'s testimony along with several other similar testimonies provided by other residents living near <i>SCP-10083</i>, further investigation regarding these disappearances were halted due to lack of evidence pointing towards any possible suspects involved in these cases (see addendum 10083b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10083.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 10083-A - Experiment Log 10083-A The following is a list of experiments that have been performed on <i>SCP-10083</i> to determine whether or not it can be accessed from any other point inside the house.

[D-9888 walks around for several minutes before bumping into the wall] Ow! What the fuck?! I just bumped into something! Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Is there anything you can use as light? D - 9 8 8 8: No, there isn't anything like that in here with me right now . Wait… what was that noise? [Several seconds pass without any further conversation between both parties] Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Are you still there? Do you need help finding your way out? D - 9 8 8 8: I'm fine , thanks… but yeah, I think it would be best if I left this place as soon as possible before something happens to me… or worse! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this experiment was concluded, it has been decided that no more personnel are allowed to enter SCP - 1 00 83 ' s interior due to safety concerns (see addendum 100 83 b).<br><br>+ Experiment Log 10083 - B + The following is a list of experiments conducted by Dr. █████████ after reports were filed regarding missing people who had gone insane shortly before disappearing completely from sight with no explanation provided by anyone who knew them well enough beforehand (see addendum 10083b). All tests have been performed on Class A amnestics subjects with previous knowledge about their missing family members/friends/acquaintances prior to entering SCP - 1 00 83 ' s interior through its entrance door and exiting via one of its exits at least once every 24 hours , unless stated otherwise .

He said he wanted some time alone so he could get away from all those people bothering him lately so we let him go off on his own without telling anyone where exactly he went off too since we didn't want him being bothered while trying find himself again after everything happened recently … God damnit ! Where did they even put up these signs ? They're hard enough for us normal people find let alone someone going insane ! What if they never found their way out ? Oh god … what if they're stuck in here forever?! That'd be horrible … oh my god … what am I supposed do now ? Maybe someone else knows how get inside this thing… oh wait ! There's someone over there walking towards me right now ! Maybe they know something about what happened over here ! Let me ask them then maybe we'll both figure out how get inside together !!! Hello sir! Do you happen know how get inside this thing ? Sorry , but no , why do you ask ? Well because my brother went crazy recently after our parents died last month and then disappeared completely afterwards leaving behind nothing but an empty house which made everyone think that maybe he killed himself because nobody ever saw him again after leaving home except for one person who said she saw him entering somewhere over here while acting really weird like some sorta zombie or something which got her worried enough so she called 911 but when police came looking for him later on they couldn't find neither hide nor hair anywhere near these walls</div>
