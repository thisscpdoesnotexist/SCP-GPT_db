I'm a bow tie dog! Dr.<br> █████: You know you're made of bow ties, right? No one else does—you're confusing the hell out of them, and they can't even figure out why that's weird to begin with. But you know what you are, don't you? You've just been pretending not to for some reason… <i>SCP-9193</i> looks scornfully at the doctor before responding in a mocking tone.<br> <i>SCP-9193</i>: What the hell do YOU think I am!? Some kind of ghost or demon or something? Why would I pretend to be a dog when I could be anything else in the world and get away with it?? This way everyone thinks I'm normal and doesn't look at me funny cuz they don't understand what's going on and that gets annoying! So there! <End Log><br> Closing Statement: At this point in time it appeared as though <i>SCP-9193</i> had no particular agenda other than being generally unpleasant; however, its ability to shape reality around itself without anyone noticing raises some disturbing questions about its motives for going unnoticed by all who encounter it so far (see Addendum 9193a).<br><br>Item #/Designation Description Procedure for Destruction/Containment Status Notes A 5<i>" x 7"</i> photograph depicting an elderly man wearing glasses holding up two fingers in a peace sign while standing next to an unidentified young boy wearing thick glasses and holding up four fingers while smiling widely The photo spontaneously combusts if any individual attempts to look directly at either character within 0.03 seconds Exposure results in immediate death due to acute exhaustion following 36 hours of sustained staring into white light Any individual who has looked directly into this photograph will die exactly 24 hours afterwards unless steps are taken beforehand They may also die immediately if exposed multiple times Resulting remains have been shown to be nonradioactive None B A copy of <i>"The New Joy Of Sex"</i>, second edition Ingestion causes spontaneous combustion resulting from contact with highly flammable liquid filling pages near chapter 1 Flammable liquid is currently believed harmless Other volumes containing same substance show similar behavior but no ill effects None C Two grapes taken from same bunch Whether both grapes consumed simultaneously or separated by any period greater than 2 minutes apart causes subject's head then torso then limbs then extremities before finally abdomen and head explode Resulting pieces show no anomalous properties beyond typical explosive behavior Yellowish green fluid present during explosion contains high concentration refined sugar It is believed that ingestion resulted from emotional distress experienced during test D Standard issue military combat knife Cleanly slicing subject vertically along lower jawline causing separation between upper torso moving upwards while lower jawline moves downwards Subject experiences extreme pain until death caused by severing spinal column Note that<br><br><h3>Addendum 9193.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9193</i> Testing Log<br><br>+<br> Experiment Log 9193-1 - Experiment Log 9193-1 Test Subject: D-4831 Procedure: A copy of <i>SCP-9193</i>'s picture is placed directly in view of D-4831, who is instructed to stare at the photograph for a total of ten minutes.<br> Results: After ten minutes, D-4831's eyes had glazed over and their breathing slowed. Several seconds after being removed from the photograph and put into a containment unit, they slumped over dead without so much as a struggle. Autopsy showed that every blood vessel in their brain had burst and that there was severe brain damage as well.<br> Notes: It seems that this test subject did not have any particular resistance to <i>SCP-9193</i>'s effects. +<br> Experiment Log 9193 -5 - Experiment Log 9193 -5 Test Subject: One (1) bowl containing one (1) can each of spinach dip, guacamole dip, salsa dip, bean dip and chunky peanut butter Resulting Substance/<br>Objects: No observable changes other than becoming very green in color Autopsy results show that all internal organs have been replaced by avocado pulp with no evidence of any mechanical or chemical means being used Details are scarce due to subsequent explosion caused by researcher attempting to scoop substance back into its original container Resulting remains were found not radioactive but made up entirely out of potassium nitrate with traces of water present <Begin log> Dr. ██████ is seen holding</div>
