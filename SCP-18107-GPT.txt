The object appears to be an anthropomorphic frog with green skin, wearing a red bowtie and top hat. Its eyes are made of small black beads, while its mouth is composed of several strands of grass.<br><br>When exposed to water or any other form of liquid for more than three minutes, <i>SCP-18107</i> will begin to grow grass from its body at an accelerated rate until it has completely covered itself. This process takes approximately 30 minutes and can only be reversed by removing the excess grass manually or by exposing the object to fire for a short period of time.<br><br>Once fully grown, <i>SCP-18107</i> will become animate and begin moving around on its own power using its hind legs as well as manipulating objects with its front paws. It will attempt to interact with any nearby humans or animals in a friendly manner, though it does not appear able to speak or understand language. If left alone for extended periods of time <i>SCP-18107</i> will eventually enter into a dormant state where it remains motionless until reawakened by contact with liquid once again.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18107</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at all times when not being tested or observed. The object must be exposed to water or other liquids no more than once every two weeks, and any excess grass must be removed immediately after each exposure.<br><br>Any personnel interacting with <i>SCP-18107</i> are to wear protective clothing and gloves at all times, as contact with the object's grass has been known to cause mild skin irritation in some individuals.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18107.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18107</i> was discovered in the possession of a Mr. ██████, who had been attempting to sell it on an online auction website. After being contained by Foundation personnel, Mr. ██████ was administered a Class-A amnestic and released without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18107.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18107</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18107</i> was interviewed by Dr. ███████ in an attempt to better understand its behavior and nature. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-18107</i>, can you tell me your name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18107</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br> Dr. ███████:</b> Do you know why we keep you here?<br><b><br> <i>SCP-18107</i>:</b> [Remains silent for a few moments before slowly shaking its head]<br><br><h3> Addendum 18107.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #1:</b> <i>SCP-18107</i> was exposed to a glass of water for five minutes. Upon completion, the object had grown grass from its body and became animate. It proceeded to interact with a nearby lab technician in a friendly manner before entering into a dormant state after approximately twenty minutes.<br><b><br>Test #2:</b> <i>SCP-18107</i> was exposed to liquid nitrogen for two minutes. Upon completion, the object had grown grass from its body but did not become animate as expected. The excess grass was removed manually and the object returned to its inert state without further incident.</div>
