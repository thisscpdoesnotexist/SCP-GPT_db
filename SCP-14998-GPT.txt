Any information regarding <i>SCP-14998</i> is to be given to both organizations. The Foundation's main goal in <i>SCP-14998</i> is containment of all anomalous items that would cause large scale destruction if used in combat, while the GOC's main goal is containment of all anomalous items that would give an edge in battle or otherwise aid their side.<br><br>The GOC and Foundation are not allowed to use any anomalous objects during <i>SCP-14998</i> except for those deemed absolutely necessary by O5 Command. These objects are usually used as a last resort during battles, but have been known to be used on multiple occasions throughout the war despite this rule being put<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14998</i> is a war being waged between the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) over control of Earth. It is unknown how long <i>SCP-14998</i> has been taking place, but it has been occurring for at least ███ years. It is estimated that the GOC has lost over ██ million personnel since the beginning of <i>SCP-14998</i>, while the Foundation has lost an estimated 4,000 personnel in its entirety.<br><br><i>SCP-14998</i>'s primary front is located in [REDACTED], Russia; however, skirmishes have occurred all over Earth as well as on Luna and Mars. The majority of these skirmishes are small scale engagements between Mobile Task Forces (MTFs) and GOC Special Task Forces (STFs). However, there have been larger battles involving multiple MTFs against multiple STFs or even several MTFs against one STF. These battles are usually extremely costly for both sides with heavy casualties on both sides regardless of who wins or loses; however, if one side does win they will usually take a large amount of territory from their enemy before they withdraw back to their original borders. The most notable battle was fought between Mobile Task Force Omega 7 (<i>"Red Right Hand"</i>) and Special Task Force Lambda-12 (<i>"The Cleaners"</i>) at [REDACTED]. This battle lasted for three days with almost no casualties on either side until Lambda 12 withdrew after suffering heavy casualties due to sustained artillery fire from MTF O7's position within Site ██'s walls.<br><br><h3>Addendum 14998.1 : </h3>??????<br><br>On ██/██/████, the GOC launched a surprise attack on Site-19 using several STFs. The attack was repelled by MTF O5-█ (<i>"Samsara"</i>) with no casualties except for one member of MTF O5-█. The GOC suffered heavy casualties and withdrew from the area after losing over ██% of their forces.<br><br><h3>Addendum 14998.2 : </h3>Interview with ????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ???? </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after the GOC's attack on Site-19. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Good morning, ????, how are you feeling? ????: I'm fine; just a little tired from all the fighting yesterday. <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>I see, well let's get started then shall we? [Dr. ████ turns on recording device] <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Could you tell me what happened during the attack on Site-19? ????: Sure thing doc, it went down like this… [The rest of the interview is completely redacted due to security reasons.] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing <i>SCP-14998</i>'s history and information gathered by MTF O5-█ during their encounter with <i>SCP-14998</i>-A , O5 Command has decided that <i>SCP-14998</i> should be reclassified as Neutralized until further notice by O5 Command .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14998.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 14998-1:<br><br>On ██/██/████, several members of MTF O5-█ (<i>"Samsara"</i>) were sent to [REDACTED] in order to test the effects of <i>SCP-14998</i> on an individual who was not involved with either side. The subject was a 32 year old Caucasian male named ██████ █████████. The subject was placed in a room with no windows and only one door which had been locked from the outside by MTF O5-█. After approximately 5 minutes, two members of GOC Special Task Force Lambda 12 (<i>"The Cleaners"</i>) entered the room and attempted to kill Mr.████████ using standard weaponry as well as several anomalous items that were deemed safe for use during <i>SCP-14998</i> by O5 Command. However, after 10 minutes had passed Mr.████████ opened his eyes and spoke in a voice that did not sound like his own saying <i>"I am sorry."</i> before vanishing completely from existence leaving behind only his clothes and equipment on the floor where he once stood along with several dead members of STF Lambda 12 scattered around him covered in blood splatter consistent with being killed by high caliber gunfire at close range; however, no guns or casings were found within the room other than those belonging to MTF O5-█ who witnessed what happened through cameras placed throughout the room before opening fire on STF Lambda 12 after they entered it due to not knowing what would happen when Mr.████████ opened his eyes again or if he would be able to do so again due to never having done so before during any previous tests involving <i>SCP-14998</i> . It is currently unknown if Mr.████████ is still alive or if he somehow escaped from containment; however, it is believed that he may have been abducted by an unknown third party for reasons unknown at this time .</div>
