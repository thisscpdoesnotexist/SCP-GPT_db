Once attached, the outer layer will begin secreting digestive enzymes which break down the victim's internal organs over the course of several hours before liquefying them into an orange substance which is then absorbed by <i>SCP-15308</i>. The process can be interrupted if the victim receives medical treatment within 24 hours; however, this has only been successful in halting the process once it has begun .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15308.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-15308</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. █████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted in order to determine the origin of <i>SCP-15308</i>, as well as its motives. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-15308</i>.

Now tell me about yourself; what do you remember? <i>SCP-15308</i> remains silent for several seconds before responding with a series of groans and whimpers similar to that of an infant crying . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Please answer the question, 15308; we need to know more about you if we want to help you get home! (<i>SCP-15308</i> continues making noises) Alright then… let's try something else then! How did your skin become like this? (<i>SCP-15308</i> begins making loud moaning noises) Please stop that; it's very distracting! (<i>SCP-15</i> 308 continues) Well if that's how it is then fine! We'll just leave until your ready to cooperate! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>As expected from an animate mass of dead human skin tissue, there was no response from SCP - 15 308 .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15308.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15308-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15308, a Caucasian male in his mid 20s.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is to be placed within <i>SCP-15308</i>'s containment cell.
