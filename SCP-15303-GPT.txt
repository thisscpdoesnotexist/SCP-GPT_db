No personnel are to enter <i>SCP-15303</i>'s containment chamber unless they are wearing earplugs or other soundproofing devices. Any personnel exposed to <i>SCP-15303</i>'s effects must be treated with Class A amnesiacs and transferred to the nearest medical facility for treatment of any injuries sustained during exposure, as well as undergo therapy sessions conducted at least once every 24 hours while under treatment with Class A amnesiacs .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15303</i> is a Fisher-Price cat music box. The object was recovered from the home of ████████ ████, a family man living in [REDACTED], after reports of his children being found <i>"playing"</i> with <i>SCP-15303</i>. The object is made of plastic, and has two dials on it; one for volume and one for speed.<br><br><i>SCP-15303</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when a human subject turns the speed dial to <i>"play"</i>. When this occurs, all humans within earshot (approximately 10 meters) will begin to dance uncontrollably until they are no longer within earshot of <i>SCP-15303</i>. This effect lasts indefinitely unless the subject is rendered unconscious or killed by an outside force. This effect also applies to subjects that do not possess legs, such as amputees or quadriplegics, who will instead begin to move their arms in rhythm with the music produced by <i>SCP-15303</i> until they are no longer within earshot of it.<br><br>After approximately 15 minutes have passed since the object was activated, subjects affected by its effects will be unable to recall any events that occurred during their exposure to it; however, they will still retain any injuries sustained during this time period. Subjects exposed for more than 30 minutes exhibit symptoms similar to those caused by prolonged exposure to an unknown cognitohazardous <br><br><b>agent: </b>Subjects experience severe memory loss regarding events occurring before their exposure as well as long term memory loss regarding events occurring after their exposure; however these memories can be recovered through therapy sessions conducted at least once every 24 hours while under treatment with Class A amnesiacs . Subjects exposed for more than 60 minutes become unresponsive and catatonic; brain scans show that these subjects' brains have been completely replaced with white matter resembling that found in cats' brains (see Addendum 15303-1). After 96 hours pass since initial activation of <i>SCP-15303</i> , affected subjects expire via cardiac arrest due to sudden failure of both ventricles . Autopsies reveal that all organs in these subjects' bodies have been replaced with those belonging solely in cats (see Addendum 15303-2). All attempts at removing <i>SCP-15303</i> from its current location have failed so far due its anomalous effects affecting anyone attempting removal from inside its containment chamber .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15303.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████████ ████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. James </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15303</i> was recovered from Mr. ████████'s home, in order to determine the extent of his exposure to <i>SCP-15303</i>'s effects and whether he had any knowledge regarding its origins or how it came into his possession. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Foreman: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████, my name is Doctor Foreman; I'm with the Foundation and I'd like to ask you a few questions about your recent exposure to <i>SCP-15303</i>. <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Sure thing doc, go ahead and shoot away! <br><br><b>Dr. Foreman: </b>Alright then… So first off can you tell me where you found this object? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Oh that? It was just lying around in my backyard; I don't know how it got there, but I thought it looked pretty neat so I picked it up for my kids! Man they loved that thing! They played with it all day long every day for weeks on end until one day they just stopped playing with it… Dr.: Hm… Can you tell me anything about what your children did while playing with this object? Mr.: Well not really doc; they were always outside when they played with that thing so all we could hear were their screams of joy or whatever coming from outside whenever we tried talking to them through the window… But one time our neighbor came over here asking if she could borrow some eggs because she said her chickens had been acting weird lately; man those things are dumb as hell so we lent her a dozen eggs without thinking twice about it! Later on when she came back over here though she told us that those chickens must have been possessed by demons or something because all of them had suddenly started attacking each other until only one chicken remained standing at the end of the whole ordeal! She even showed us pictures of what happened but none of us could really make heads or tails outta what happened there… That poor chicken though must have gotten lonely afterwards cause soon enough she started making out with our dog whenever he wasn't looking and then eventually started fucking him too! The next morning after that happened our dog woke up covered in blood from head to toe and none of us knew why until later on when we found out he'd eaten both our cats alive during his sleep!!! We never saw either him nor either cat again after that night though…. Anyways sorry for rambling on like this doc but uh do you think maybe this music box has something to do with why my kids stopped playing with it? Or maybe even why their pets killed each other?! Doc:: Hmm well right now sir we're still trying figure everything out ourselves as well as trying figure out where exactly your children are right now…. [At this point Doctor Foreman pauses briefly before continuing] …but regardless if these events are related or not please take note sir that no matter how much fun your children may be having right now at least they'll be able to live longer than 15 minutes longer than anyone else exposed to <i>SCP-15303</i> will be able [At which point Doctor Foreman abruptly stands up ] …Thank You sir for answering these questions today…. Goodbye [ At which point Doctor Forrester exits containment chamber ] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After exiting containment chamber , Agent Forrester immediately proceeded towards Site Director Thorne's office under orders from O5 Command . While en route , Agent Forrester radioed Site Director Thorne requesting permission for an immediate termination order against both ████████ family members due potential contamination risk posed by <i>SCP-15303</i> . Upon receiving permission , Agent Forrester proceeded towards residence belonging ████████ family members . Upon arrival , Agent Forrester entered residence via front door (which was unlocked) and proceeded upstairs towards bedroom belonging ████████ family members . Upon reaching bedroom door (which was locked) , Agent requested assistance in opening door via radio ; however upon receiving no response within 5 seconds agent forcibly kicked down bedroom door using leg strength trained during Foundation training sessions . Once inside room agent discovered both ████████ family members dead due apparent cardiac arrest caused by sudden failure ventricles ; autopsies revealed organs belonging solely in cats replacing organs formerly belonging solely human subjects (see Addendum 15303-2). Next agent discovered remains two pet cats deceased due unknown causes ; brain scans revealed white<br><br><h3>Addendum 15303.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 15303-1<br><br>Subject(s): D-9294, D-8674, D-8853, and D-8912. All subjects were equipped with earplugs prior to testing.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15303</i> was activated and the speed dial was set to <i>"play"</i> for 10 minutes. After this time period had elapsed, the subject's hearing protection was removed and they were questioned on their experience while exposed to <i>SCP-15303</i>'s effects. <br><br><b>Results: </b>All four subjects reported feeling a strong compulsion to dance when exposed to <i>SCP-15303</i>; however all four also reported that they did not feel like they had any control over their movements while dancing due to this compulsion . When questioned on their thoughts regarding the music produced by <i>SCP-15303</i> during exposure , all four expressed feelings of fear and unease due to its loudness (approximately 120 dB). One subject expressed a desire for it stop playing after approximately 3 minutes had passed since activation of the object; however he then began dancing again when it restarted playing after 5 minutes . This cycle repeated itself until it reached 10 minutes , at which point he attempted unsuccessfully several times in quick succession to turn off <i>SCP-15303</i> before collapsing from exhaustion . The other three subjects expressed similar desires at various points during exposure .
