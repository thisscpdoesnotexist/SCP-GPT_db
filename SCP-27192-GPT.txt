    <h1>SCP-27192</h1>
<h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-27192</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27192 refers to a small, tightly knit community of entities believed to be the descendants of the mythological figure Medusa. This community comprises approximately 50 individuals, each displaying unique anomalous properties consistent with the Gorgon archetype from Ancient Greek mythology. Specifically, these entities possess the ability to transmute organic matter into stone through direct eye contact.</p>
<p>Members of SCP-27192 demonstrate a range of physical characteristics not entirely human. Their most notable feature is a complete head of serpentine hair, with each individual snake acting independently from the host and displaying varying degrees of venomous capability. Entities also exhibit enhanced durability, strength, and longevity. Genetic analysis indicates a mixture of non-human and human DNA, suggesting a possible hybrid origin.</p>
<p>SCP-27192 is capable of speech and demonstrates intelligence on par with that of an average human adult. They have been observed communicating in a previously unknown dialect believed to be a derivative of Ancient Greek. The community has showcased a complex social structure and maintains a secretive existence, with traditions and rituals consistent with Ancient Gorgon worship.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to the hazardous nature of SCP-27192 and the risk of catastrophic mass petrification events, containment must prioritize obfuscation and isolation. The area surrounding SCP-27192's known habitat has been designated as a no-fly zone and has been cordoned off under the guise of environmental protection.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-27192 are required to interface with the community via remote-operated drones equipped with a two-way communication system, as no direct visual contact is safe. In case of a breach, MTF Eta-10 ("See No Evil") will be dispatched to enact recontainment procedures, which include the use of specialized visors equipped with blindness-inducing failsafes.</p>
<p>Any unauthorized individuals venturing within a five-kilometer radius of the containment area are to be intercepted, amnesticized, and released at a safe distance. Research proposals must be submitted to and approved by the Site Director, with a strong preference for non-invasive observational studies.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Recovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-27192 was discovered after a series of petrification incidents in the rural region of [REDACTED], where several missing persons cases were reported. The Foundation intervened after local folklore and art matched descriptions and representations of the entities' unique characteristics. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery of SCP-27192.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment 27192-A</strong>
- <strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the range of petrification ability.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> A D-Class personnel equipped with a full-face protective visor was gradually brought closer to the containment field in predetermined increments.
- <strong>Result:</strong> Petrification effect initiated at a range of 15 meters. The process was halted due to the protective visor shielding the subject's eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 27192-B</strong>
- <strong>Objective:</strong> To ascertain if SCP-27192's petrification can be reversed.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> A recently transmuted rat was subjected to a variety of physical and chemical treatments.
- <strong>Result:</strong> All attempts to reverse petrification failed, indicating that the condition is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 27192-C</strong>
- <strong>Objective:</strong> To test the effect of mirrored surfaces on SCP-27192 entities.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> A drone was fitted with a mirrored panel and directed to fly within sight of SCP-27192.
- <strong>Result:</strong> SCP-27192 members demonstrated awareness of the danger posed by the mirror, actively avoiding eye contact. No petrification occurred.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Interview Log</h3>
<p><strong>Interview 27192-01</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Reyes conducted an interview with an SCP-27192 entity identified as "Medea" (SCP-27192-1) via the two-way communication system installed in a drone. The transcript below has been translated from the unknown dialect.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> Good afternoon, Medea. Are you comfortable speaking with us now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> I find little comfort in this exchange, but I shall speak.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> We desire to understand your community better. Can you share your history?</p>
<p>[The entity appears contemplative before responding.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> Our history is our own, but know this: we are the remnants of a lineage scorned, a progeny of the anguished Medusa. Her cry at her end was our beginning. Dispensation and dread are woven into our very being.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> And these abilities you possess, the petrification â€” is this a defense mechanism?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> It is more. It is the gaze of judgment, our birthright, and our curse. It is not wielded but exists as essence does.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> Are there ways we can coexist, in peace?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> Coexistence is a tapestry of complexity. We seek not your world. Our seclusion is our peace.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> Do you have intentions beyond your seclusion?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> Intentions are as the wind to the mountain, ever-pressing but never changing. We exist as we must, ask no more of it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reyes:</strong> Thank you, Medea. Your insight is invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-27192-1/Medea:</strong> Then value it by granting us our isolation.</p>
<p>[End of Interview]</p>
<p>Following interviews and under the guidance of SCP-27192, containment procedures were updated to ensure minimum disturbance to their community. Ongoing surveillance continues to suggest that SCP-27192, while dangerous, shows little interest in engaging with the outside world provided their isolation remains respected.</p></div>
