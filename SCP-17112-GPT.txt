It consists of two components: A headset and a control unit. The headset contains electrodes which are placed on the head of the user and connected to the control unit via wires.<br><br>When activated, <i>SCP-17112</i> emits electrical signals through these electrodes into the brain of its user, causing them to experience intense euphoria and pleasure. This effect can last for up to five minutes before dissipating. After this time period has elapsed, subjects will become unresponsive and enter into a comatose state until they are removed from <i>SCP-17112</i>'s influence or receive medical treatment.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17112</i> have been observed in all individuals tested so far regardless of age or gender; however it appears more effective in those with certain neurological conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders. Additionally, prolonged use may lead to permanent damage both mentally and physically due to its highly addictive nature; users often require increasingly higher doses in order to achieve their desired effects leading up potentially fatal overdoses if not monitored carefully by personnel trained in handling dangerous anomalies such as this one.<br><br>Due to its highly addictive nature and potential for abuse, testing with <i>SCP-17112</i> requires Level 4 authorization at minimum unless otherwise specified by O5 Command staff members; experimentation should only be conducted under strict supervision at all times by personnel trained in handling hazardous anomalies such as this one.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17112</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times when not in use. Access to the device must be restricted to personnel with Level 4 authorization or higher, and only under strict supervision by personnel trained in handling hazardous anomalies such as this one.<br><br>Testing with <i>SCP-17112</i> is only allowed with approval from O5 Command staff members; any unauthorized attempts will result in disciplinary action. Additionally, all test subjects must be monitored closely for signs of addiction or overdose, and medical treatment should be administered immediately if either are observed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17112.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a series of tests were conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17112</i> on non-human subjects. The results of these tests showed that <i>SCP-17112</i> had no effect on animals, and instead caused them to become agitated and aggressive. It is currently unknown why this occurs; further testing is required in order to better understand the anomaly's effects on non-human subjects.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17112.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-17112-1<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> D-17112-1 was a subject in the first test of <i>SCP-17112</i>.
