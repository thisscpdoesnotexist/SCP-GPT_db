The room must also have an airlock that can be used to prevent <i>SCP-9918</i> from escaping the containment chamber. The containment chamber must also have a minimum of 5 meters between the floor and ceiling, as well as having walls made out of concrete or any other substance that cannot be consumed by <i>SCP-9918</i> .<br><br><i>SCP-9918</i>'s containment chamber is to be kept at a temperature between -5 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius at all times, with the temperature being lowered if <i>SCP-9918</i> begins consuming itself . If this occurs, personnel are to enter the containment chamber and attempt to stop it from consuming itself<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9918</i> is a small grey rabbit that endlessly produces dust, which was discovered after a sealed clean room was found covered in dust at the Foundation. <i>SCP-9918</i> is capable of existing in any environment, and will not stop producing dust until it runs out of material to consume. <i>SCP-9918</i> consumes anything that is made of solid matter within its reach.<br><br><i>SCP-9918</i> has shown to be capable of consuming other instances of itself, as well as other objects that are also made out of dust. If no solid matter is available for it to consume, <i>SCP-9918</i> will begin to consume itself until there is nothing left for it to consume.<br><br><i>SCP-9918</i>'s ability seems limited by its size; if an instance exceeds 10 meters in diameter or height (whichever would be greater), the instance will collapse upon itself and begin consuming all nearby matter . This process has been observed from within the collapsing instance; however due to being inside an object with a mass greater than ████ kg, researchers are unable to determine what happens next . These events have been classified as an XK Class End Of The World Scenario event due to their potential threat towards humanity and reality at large . It should be noted that these events only occur when non human entities are present inside the collapsing instances , with no such event occurring when human beings were present during testing . See Addendum 9918 -1 for more details on this subject .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9918.1 : </h3>███/██/████<br><br>During testing, D-2800 was sent into <i>SCP-9918</i>'s containment chamber to observe its behavior. After 5 minutes of observation, <i>SCP-9918</i> began to consume itself and collapsed upon itself after 2 minutes . The event was considered a success and the test was ended. However, during the collapse of <i>SCP-9918</i> , a large amount of dust was expelled from the center of it before it disappeared completely . This dust quickly covered the entire containment chamber in less than 1 minute , which is much faster than any other instance of <i>SCP-9918</i> has been observed doing so . It should be noted that no more instances were produced by <i>SCP-9918</i> during this event .<br><br>After this event occurred, all personnel were ordered to evacuate the area around Site 19 immediately. All entrances leading into Site 19 have been sealed off until further notice as well as all exits leading out from Site 19. Due to these events occurring within a Foundation facility , it is highly likely that an XK Class End Of The World Scenario event has occurred or will occur soon . Due to this possibility , O5 Command has deemed that any information pertaining to these events are classified at a level above Omega Clearance until further notice; however due to their importance towards understanding what happened at Site 19 and preventing them from happening again in the future, they have been included here for reference purposes only<br><br><h3>Addendum 9918.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████<br><br>+ Interview Log - Close <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> █████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to gain information about <i>SCP-9918</i> and the events that occurred at Site 19 on ███/██/████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Oh, sorry about that, I'm █████████ . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Thank you for your time, Mr…? Mr. XXXXXX?: It's just █████████ , no need for my last name . Dr. █████ nods in response and begins writing notes on his clipboard . Mr. XXXXXX?: So why am I here again? I told you everything I know when we had our little chat before… Dr. █████ pauses from writing notes and looks up at Mr XXXXXX with a stern expression on his face . He then closes his clipboard and places it down next to him before speaking again . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>We have reason to believe that an XK Class End Of The World Scenario event has occurred or will occur soon due to recent events inside of Site 19 during testing with <i>SCP-9918</i> …Mr XXXXXX looks visibly shaken by this statement but remains silent as he listens closely to what the doctor is saying .

The temperature of the room is lowered to -10 degrees Celsius, with the airlock being closed after D-2800 is placed inside. After 10 minutes, D-2800 begins to complain about how cold it is and states that he can't feel his fingers anymore . The temperature of the room was then lowered to -20 degrees Celsius and a small amount of material was added into <i>SCP-9918</i>'s containment chamber through the airlock in order for it to consume .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 5 minutes, D-2800 complains about how cold it has become and states that he can no longer feel his feet anymore. He then asks if he could be removed from <i>SCP-9918</i>'s containment chamber due to him not being able to see anything due to all of the dust in front of him . Upon this request being denied by Dr. ██████ , another researcher enters into <i>SCP-9918</i>'s containment chamber and attempts to remove D - 28 00 from its position by pulling on his arm . However, as soon as they touch each other , both instances begin consuming each other until there is nothing left for them both except dust . This event has been classified as an XK Class End Of The World Scenario event due [DATA EXPUNGED]</div>
