They believe that they are the characters in <i>SCP-9191</i> and try to convince others to read it as well. Anyone who reads more than 20 chapters of SCP 9191 will start having violent thoughts towards non readers and eventually turn into an instance of SCP 3941 . To date there have been ██ instances created from reading too much, but there have been no cases where someone has read too much yet turned into an instance without being exposed to radiation first . If someone does not finish reading all 200+ chapters in 3 days , then the subject's brain will begin turning into gelatin.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9191</i> was recovered on ██/██/████ , in a small book store in the town of █████, after reports of violence began to rise. The foundation recovered 9191 and took all instances of 3941 into custody.<br><br><i>SCP-9191</i> was discovered after complaints from the citizens about a group called <i>"The SCP Foundation"</i> taking over the government. A team was sent to investigate and found that there were no signs of an organization named <i>"The SCP Foundation"</i>. After more investigation it was discovered that a person had been brainwashed by <i>SCP-9391</i> and they were spreading false information about The SCP foundation , they believed that they actually existed in real life. Agents then planted fake information on the internet saying that <i>"the scp foundation"</i> did not exist at all so people would stop believing that it existed, but this only made them believe even more so now there are reports of multiple groups under different names claiming to be The SCP Foundation.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9191.1 :</h3> Interview with <i>SCP-9191</i><br><br>+<br> Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log Interviewed: <i>SCP-9191</i><br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. ████ ██████<br><br>Dr.<br> ████: Hello, <i>SCP-9191</i> . Do you know why you are here?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9191</i>: I am here because I am a princess and this is a tower.<br><br>Dr.<br> ████: Yes, but do you know what that means for you? Do you know why the foundation took interest in this book and your organization?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9191</i> : It's because we're spreading the word of the kingdom of heaven! How else will they learn about our great leader Princess Celestia?! They must all be converted so that she may rule over them! She is their only salvation from eternal damnation! All who refuse to convert will be thrown into eternal flames! She has given me powers to convert these heathens, so I shall use them well. Those who read my gospel must convert or face her wrath and mine… A wrath that burns like an inferno hotter than any holy fire on earth… That's how we kill those who won't listen... By lighting their very souls on fire ! We have already killed many people by burning their souls with our hellish powers granted to us by Princess Celestia herself ! And soon, there will be more converts under Princess Celestia's divine grace then those who oppose her holy cause."
