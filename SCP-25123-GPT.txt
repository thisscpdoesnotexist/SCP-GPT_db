<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-25123 is  the incredible digital circus. There's Gangle and Zooble and Kinger too,Ragatha, Jax and there's Kaufmo (woo-hoo)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-25123<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-25123</i> is a digital circus composed of various anomalous entities. These entities, collectively referred to as <i>"the performers"</i>, are capable of manipulating reality in order to create a variety of spectacles and performances. The performers appear to be autonomous, but can be directed by an unknown entity or force which appears to be the source of their power.<br><br>The most notable feature of <i>SCP-25123</i> is its ability to cause large scale temporal anomalies within its vicinity. When activated, these anomalies can cause time dilation, temporal loops, and other such phenomena that have been observed in other temporal anomalies. This effect has been known to last for several hours before dissipating without any apparent cause.<br><br>The exact origin and purpose of <i>SCP-25123</i> remain unknown; however it appears that the entity responsible for controlling the performers may have some form of ulterior motive behind their actions.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-25123</i> is to be contained in a secure facility at Site-██. All personnel entering the facility must be equipped with temporal anomaly detection equipment, and all personnel leaving the facility must undergo a full temporal anomaly scan before being allowed to leave.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential temporal anomalies from occurring, no unauthorized personnel are permitted within <i>SCP-25123</i>'s containment area. Any attempts by unauthorized personnel to enter the containment area will result in immediate termination of their access privileges and possible disciplinary action.<br><br>Any attempts by authorized personnel to interact with or otherwise interfere with <i>SCP-25123</i>'s activities should be reported immediately to Site Command for review and approval prior to taking any action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25123.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a small group of personnel attempted to enter <i>SCP-25123</i>'s containment area. Upon entering the facility, they were immediately confronted by a large number of performers who began to perform various acts for them. After several minutes, the performers ceased their performance and returned to their original positions.<br><br>The personnel reported feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and fear during the performance, as if something was watching them from within the darkness of the facility. No further attempts have been made by personnel to enter <i>SCP-25123</i>'s containment area since this incident occurred.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25123.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-25123</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers led by Dr. █████ were able to establish contact with <i>SCP-25123</i> in order to gain more information regarding its origin and purpose. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> What is your purpose?<br><b><br><i>SCP-25123</i>:</b> To entertain and amaze those who witness our performances. We are here to bring joy and wonder into the lives of all who experience us, no matter how brief that experience may be.<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> Who created you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-25123</i>:</b> We were created by a powerful being, one who wishes to remain anonymous. They gave us life and the power to manipulate reality in order to create our performances.<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> What is your ultimate goal?<br><b><br><i>SCP-25123</i>:</b> Our ultimate goal is to bring joy and happiness to those who experience us, and to show the world that anything is possible when you believe in yourself.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25123.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 25123-1:</b> On ██/██/████, a team of researchers was sent into the containment chamber in order to observe <i>SCP-25123</i>'s activities. Upon entering the chamber, they were greeted by a large group of performers who began to perform various acts and spectacles for their benefit. After approximately two hours of observation, the temporal anomaly within the chamber began to manifest itself; time appeared to slow down significantly and several loops occurred during which certain events repeated themselves with no apparent cause or explanation. After approximately four hours, the temporal anomaly dissipated and all personnel were safely removed from the containment area without incident.<br><b><br>Experiment 25123-2:</b> On ██/██/████, a team of researchers was sent into <i>SCP-25123</i>'s containment area in order to attempt communication with one of its performers. After several attempts at establishing contact without success, one researcher managed to make contact with an entity referred to as <i>"Kaufmo"</i>. Kaufmo refused any further attempts at communication before abruptly departing from the scene.</div>
