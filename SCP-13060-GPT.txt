I'd like to ask you a few questions about your DVD of the 50th season of <i>"The Simpsons"</i>. How did you come into possession of it?<br><br><b>███████████: </b>Well, I used to work at [REDACTED] until they closed down due to bankruptcy in 2027. They had a warehouse full of old stuff that wasn't worth selling off so we took some things home with us and put them in my garage until we decided what we wanted to do with them.<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>So how did you decide what went into your collection and what went on eBay?<br><br><b>███████████: </b>Well, most things were just thrown out but there were some items that I kept because they had sentimental value or because I thought they might be valuable later on down the line - like this DVD here (indicates <i>SCP-13060</i>). <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>And why did you think it would be valuable?<br><br>███████████ pauses for several seconds before replying…<br><br><b>███████████: </b>Look, let's just say that if something happened and all humanity disappeared tomorrow then this is one thing that will survive us as long as there's someone left alive somewhere who can play a DVD player… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After the interview was concluded Mr. █████ immediately requested termination citing psychological trauma from his time at [REDACTED].
