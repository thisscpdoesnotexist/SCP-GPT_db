<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21262 is  the dangers of canned beef</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21262<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21262</i> is a phenomenon that causes canned beef to become highly dangerous. When ingested, the affected canned beef will cause severe gastrointestinal distress and in some cases death. In addition, the affected cans of beef will begin to emit a low level radiation that can be detected by Geiger counters.<br><br>The source of this phenomenon has yet to be determined but it appears to affect any brand or variety of canned beef regardless of expiration date or manufacturing process. It is believed that <i>SCP-21262</i> may have been caused by an unknown contamination event during production or storage, however this has yet to be confirmed.<br><br>Attempts at containing <i>SCP-21262</i> have failed as it does not appear to respond well to traditional containment methods due to its ability to spread quickly and easily through multiple cans of beef without warning or detection until after ingestion. Due to these factors, all instances of contaminated canned beef must be destroyed immediately upon discovery in order prevent further contamination and spread of the anomaly.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-21262</i>, containment is not possible. All instances of contaminated canned beef must be destroyed immediately upon discovery and all personnel handling such products must take extreme caution when doing so.<br><br>Any stores or distributors found to be selling contaminated canned beef are to be shut down and their stock confiscated for destruction. Additionally, any individuals who have consumed affected cans of beef should be monitored for signs of illness and treated appropriately if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21262.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a sample of contaminated canned beef was discovered in a store in [REDACTED]. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the source of contamination had been caused by an employee who had deliberately injected the cans with a radioactive substance. The employee has since been detained and is currently being interrogated for further information.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21262.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21262</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-21262</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-21262</i>. Can you tell me why canned beef has become so dangerous?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21262</i>:</b> I cannot say for certain what caused the contamination, but I suspect it was due to an unknown event during production or storage. It appears that the affected cans of beef have been exposed to some form of radiation, which has caused them to become highly dangerous.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21262.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> Three cans of beef were placed in a sealed containment chamber and monitored for any signs of contamination. After 24 hours, radiation levels within the chamber had increased significantly and all three cans of beef were found to be contaminated. The contents of the cans were destroyed immediately.</div>
