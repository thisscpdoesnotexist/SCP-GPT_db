The past is too dangerous and we can't let it come into contact with the present or else our future will be destroyed forever. <br><br><b>Dr. Spanko: </b>What do you mean by <i>"destruction"</i>? If you don't mind me asking, I'm very curious about your organization and what it does exactly… <br><br><b>_________: </b>You see, in our time period there was a man named [REDACTED] who discovered how to travel through time using advanced technology and he used this power for his own benefit . He wanted to become immortal so he traveled through time multiple times until he found out that if he came back in time too many times then Time Paradox would occur which would destroy everything that ever existed . That's why we're here; we're trying to stop him from coming back in time because if we don't then there will be no more life on Earth as we know it . The world would be completely destroyed forever… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing this information I have decided that <i>SCP-14994</i> must not come into contact with any information about [REDACTED] or Time Paradox because they could use this knowledge against us and cause an outbreak of Time Paradox which could lead to the destruction of everything on Earth as we know it . -Dr. Spanko<br><br><h3>Addendum 14994.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14994</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dr. Spanko was to be brought into the past and was to be killed by <i>SCP-14994</i>. The killer is then to be captured and questioned about their motives.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Dr. Spanko was brought into the past, but he did not die as planned because of a faulty time machine that malfunctioned while transporting him back in time, causing him to become stuck in a time loop for three weeks before being transported back in time again, this time successfully killing Dr. Spanko . After being transported back in time again, <i>SCP-14994</i> took note of the faulty machine and immediately suspected foul play from an outside source . They then began searching for any signs of an intruder . When they found nothing after searching the room thoroughly , they concluded that there wasn't anyone else involved with the incident . This led them to believe that it must have been some sort of malfunction , so they decided to fix it themselves . After fixing it , they used it once more on Dr. Spanko , which resulted in his death due to suffocation caused by his body becoming stuck inside a vacuum tube when he traveled through space and broke out through a wall at Site 19 when he arrived at his destination point three seconds later than expected due to the malfunctioning machine breaking down during transport yet again while trying to bring him back into our present day timeline . He died instantly after breaking out through the wall because his body had been crushed under all of the rubble from said wall plus all of its contents (which included everything inside said room) which caused several fatal injuries including broken bones, internal bleeding, ruptured organs, etc… The only thing that remained intact about his body were his eyes which were still intact even though he died instantly upon impact with said rubble/contents as well as everything else mentioned earlier causing instant death upon impact with aforementioned items/debris/fatal injuries sustained from aforementioned items/debris/fatal injuries sustained from aforementioned items/debris/fatal injuries sustained from aforementioned items …etc…</div>
