He is allowed to leave his cell for one hour a day, during which time he may interact with other personnel as long as they are over the age of 60. <i>SCP-16897</i>'s containment cell must be soundproofed and equipped with noise cancelling headphones so that he does not have to listen to any sounds made by personnel under the age of 60.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16867</i> is a mathematical formula for calculating the probability that a mathematical problem will be proved today. The formula is:<br><br>P(t) = (1 - e^(-10*t)) * P(0)<br><br>where P(t) is the probability at time t and P(0) is the initial probability of proving a problem on any given day. The value of P(0) has been determined to be 0.000012, meaning that there is only a 1 in 8,000 chance of proving any given problem on any given day. It was discovered by Drs. ████ and ██████ in 19██ after they were assigned to <i>SCP-16867</i> as part of their Foundation training; however, it was not discovered by the Foundation until 19██ when an Agent investigating an unrelated anomaly noticed that this formula could be used to predict <i>SCP-16867</i>'s output with great accuracy. This Agent then reported this finding to his superiors who then reported it to O5 Command who then decided that due to its usefulness in predicting future events and anomalies, <i>SCP-16867</i> would remain unclassified until such time as someone could prove it wrong or discover what causes its anomalous properties. To date no one has been able to do either; however, research into possible explanations for <i>SCP-16867</i>'s properties continues.<br><br><i>SCP-16897</i> is an old man living inside my house who doesn't like me because I'm young and he thinks I'm too loud when I play video games late at night<br><br><h3>Addendum 16867.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-16897</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after <i>SCP-16897</i> had been contained by the Foundation for two weeks. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Good morning, Mr. ██████! I'd like to ask you some questions about your life before you were brought here by the Foundation so we can better understand why you are anomalous and what your life is like now that you're living in our facility. <br><br><b><i>SCP-16897</i>: </b>What? You mean this ain't a hotel? Where's my room service? <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>This is not a hotel, sir; it's an underground containment facility for anomalous objects and entities that have been deemed too dangerous or valuable to be allowed to roam freely outside of it . We would like to know more about your life before we brought you here so that we can better understand how exactly you became anomalous and if there are any other anomalies out there like yourself that need to be contained as well . <i>SCP-16897</i> (sighing): Fine, whatever…I'm just an old man who doesn't want young punks hanging around his house all day long making noise while he tries to sleep at night…I live alone in a small house on the outskirts of town where no one bothers me because they think I'm weird or something…all I do all day long is sit in my chair reading books or watching TV until it's time for bed and then I go back into my room where I read some more until it's time for breakfast when I eat cereal or eggs with toast or something else bland but filling because after breakfast comes lunch which also consists of bland but filling food followed by dinner which is usually bland but filling food as well…then at night when I get tired from eating so much during the day, I go into my room and watch TV again until it's time for bed again whereupon I repeat this process over and over again every single fucking day without fail because nothing ever happens around here except watching boring shows on TV all goddamn day long without anything interesting ever happening except maybe once every few months when someone comes over who isn't under 60 years old so they can hear me complain about how everything sucks these days since everyone under 60 has gone deaf due to listening to music too loud with their headphones on while playing video games late at night while doing drugs in their bedrooms with their friends instead of going outside once in awhile instead of staying inside playing video games all fucking summer vacation…now tell me doctor, what kind of exciting story did you expect from someone who lives such a dull existence? Drs. ████ & █████ (looking at each other): Interesting indeed… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing this interview, both doctors requested immediate reassignment from <i>SCP-16867</i> due them being unable to deal with his constant complaining anymore; however, O5 Command denied these requests claiming that <i>"no one else wants him either"</i> despite several personnel volunteering themselves for assignment as soon as they heard about these requests being denied including Agent [REDACTED] who stated <i>"Hell yeah! He sounds awesome!"</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 16867.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A researcher under the age of 60 is to interact with <i>SCP-16867</i>. The researcher is then to ask <i>SCP-16867</i> a question about the future. The researcher may also offer him any amount of money in return for his help, but must not mention this until after he has asked his question.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After being offered $100, <i>SCP-16867</i> answered the following <br><br><b>question: </b><i>"Will there be a nuclear war between India and Pakistan before 20██?"</i> It should be noted that at no point prior to this experiment was anyone aware that India and Pakistan were on bad terms or had nuclear weapons.<br><br>Experiment #: 2<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The same procedure as Experiment #1 was followed; however, instead of asking about India and Pakistan's relationship, the researcher asked about their cricket team's chances against South Africa in 20██. He was also given $200 this time around because he said it would take more than $100 to convince him to answer such an obscure question (he did not know much about cricket).<br><br><b>Results: </b>After being offered $200, <i>SCP-16867</i> answered the following question (note that at no point prior to this experiment was anyone aware that South Africa had won the World Cup in 20██): <i>"Will South Africa beat Australia in their first match of the World Cup?"</i><br><br>Experiment #3 - I'm sorry I don't have any more experiments recorded here but I just wanted you guys to know that I'm still working on finding out how all these numbers are getting into my head because it's really freaking me out</div>
