<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15288</i> is  the lost 60s WLVT-39 sign off</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15288</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15288</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation agents embedded within WLVT's staff. Any attempts to enter <i>SCP-15288</i> are to be stopped immediately by any means necessary.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15288</i> is a phenomenon affecting the WLVT-39 tower in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which has been broadcasting the lost 1960s WLVT sign off since 9/19/1969. The sign off appears on all channels and at all times of day. It is unknown if this is a result of <i>SCP-15288</i> or an unrelated problem with the station's broadcast equipment.<br><br><i>SCP-15288</i> was first discovered by Agent ████████ after he was sent to investigate reports of <i>"strange music"</i> coming from WLVT's tower. When Agent ████████ approached the building, he heard a man speaking over a radio that had not been turned on for years. The voice was identified as Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, who worked at WLVT during its early years and disappeared in 1969 while working on an experiment involving SCP-████ (see Addendum 15288-1).<br><br>The voice claimed to be trapped inside his office in the basement of WLVT's building and begged for help, saying that something terrible would happen if he did not escape within three days (<br><br><b>Note: </b>this time period has passed). Agents were sent to investigate immediately but found no one inside or outside of the building except for two civilians who were unable to provide any information about what they saw or heard before being administered Class A amnestics . The agents then searched every room in the basement but found nothing out of place except for Dr. Lefkowitz' office door which had been locked from within (the key was nowhere to be found) and contained several pieces of furniture that didn't belong there along with various items belonging to Dr. Lefkowitz including his lab coat , personal effects , and several books . After examining these objects, it was determined that they had all belonged to Dr. Lefkowitz before his disappearance in 1969 and appeared undisturbed despite having spent 40 years locked inside a room without power or air conditioning . All attempts at removing these objects from <i>SCP-15288</i> have failed; however, video footage taken by Foundation agents shows them disappearing when viewed through cameras attached to drones sent into <i>SCP-15288</i> . This suggests that only living beings can see them while recording devices cannot register their presence even though they are still visible through their lenses . Attempts are currently underway by Foundation engineers to develop technology capable of capturing images within SCP - 15 288 without sending humans into it directly .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15288.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-15288</i> was produced by an experiment involving SCP-████, a substance capable of altering the flow of time. Dr. Lefkowitz had been working on a way to reverse its effects when he disappeared in 1969 . The following is a transcript of the recording made by Agent ████████:<br><br><BEGIN LOG> <br><br><b>Dr. Lefkowitz: </b>I'm trapped inside my office! I don't know how it happened but there's something else in here with me! It keeps saying that it's going to kill me if I don't give it what it wants! Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>What does this thing want? <br><br><b>Dr. Lefkowitz: </b>It says that if I can get out before three days are up, then everything will be okay but…I don't think that's true…it said something about how many people have tried and failed…I can hear them screaming for help outside my door right now and- <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15288.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, a former employee of WLVT<br><br>The following is an interview with █████ █████, a former employee of WLVT who worked there in 1969 and claims to have been present during Dr. Lefkowitz' disappearance.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15288.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>The following is a log of experiments conducted by Foundation engineers to determine the nature of <i>SCP-15288</i>. All tests were conducted in the basement of WLVT's building, where <i>SCP-15288</i> is located.<br><br>Test <br><br><b>15288-1: </b>One D-Class personnel was sent into <i>SCP-15288</i> to retrieve an object belonging to Dr. Lefkowitz (a book titled <i>"The Reality War"</i>). The D-Class was instructed to touch the book and then return with it immediately after doing so. The D-Class did as instructed but upon returning outside of SCP - 15 288 , he reported that the book had disappeared from his hand even though he could still see it . He also reported being unable to enter or exit from any door within SCP - 15 288 . At this point, all further attempts at retrieving objects from within SCP - 15 288 have been discontinued and are considered too risky for future experiments . Test 15288 - 2: A camera attached to a drone was sent into SCP - 15 288 and instructed to record everything that it saw while inside . After several hours, the camera stopped recording due to technical difficulties but continued transmitting audio back through its microphone until its batteries ran out 3 days later . This audio has been transcribed <br><br><b>below: </b><BEGIN LOG> Drone <br><br><b>Camera: </b>[Drone Camera moves forward slowly] [Several minutes pass; Drone Camera continues moving forward] <br><br><b>Dr. Lefkowitz: </b>Get away! Get away! It's not safe here! It said I'm next if you don't leave now! Please go before it comes back! Drone <br><br><b>Camera: </b>What is this place? Is this your office? <br><br><b>Dr. Lefkowitz: </b>Yes…but please get out before you're hurt too…[Drone Camera stops moving] Drone <br><br><b>Camera: </b>Sorry sir, I can't do that right now…I need your help first…I'm trying my best but I can't seem t o move my legs or arms…they're just not responding anymore … <br><br><b>Dr. Lefkowitz: </b>Oh God no..please don't do this..don't let him take me again…. [Several minutes pass; Drone Camera begins moving forward again] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Test 15288 – 3: A second drone was sent into SCP – 15 288 with instructions similar t o those given during Experiment 1 5 2 8 – 1 , except that instead of retrieving an object belonging t o Dr . Le fko witz , i t wa s in structe d t o find him a nd bring him back outside immediately after doing so (<br><br><b>Note: </b>Thi s wa s th e first attempt at retrieving anyone who had entered Sc P – 1 5 2 8). The drone successfully found Dr . Le fko witz 's body inside his office and brought it outside using a robotic arm attached on top of i ts c hassi s (<br><br><b>Note: </b>Thi s wa s done becau se previous experim enta l results suggested tha t living beings cou ld be retrieved fro m Sc P – 1 5 2 8 b y using equipmen t capable o f entering i nto i ts interior without sending humans directly ).

Why did you stop recording? Where's the body? Where are you right now ? Are you okay? We didn't lose contact with you did we ? Say something ! Agent ████████'s <br><br><b>Assistant: </b>Sir ! You need ti come over here right now ! Something happened while we were talking ! Agent ████████'s Assistant points towards two civilians standing nearby who appear confused about what they just witnessed <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br></div>
