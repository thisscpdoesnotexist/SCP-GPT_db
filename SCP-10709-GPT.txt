All personnel who have access to <i>SCP-10709</i>'s code base are required to submit their credentials for approval by Dr. ██████ before they are allowed to access it. Any changes made by personnel must be logged and approved by Dr. ██████ before being implemented into the code base; this includes both additions and deletions of any kind as well as any alterations made to the code itself (See Addendum 10709-D).<br><br><i>SCP-10709</i> is currently running on a dedicated server in Site 19, with all personnel who have access requiring approval from Dr. ██████ prior to accessing it or making changes of any kind (See Addendum<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10709</i> is a machine learning algorithm that creates new SCP objects. <i>SCP-10709</i> was created by Dr. ██████, and is used to create new SCPs for use in the Foundation's database.<br><br><i>SCP-10709</i> was originally created as a way to automatically categorize new SCPs into their respective object classes, but has since been repurposed as a method of creating new SCPs. <i>SCP-10709</i> will generate an average of 1,000 potential SCPs per day, with approximately 80% of those being Keter level objects due to the nature of machine learning algorithms to learn from previous mistakes and improve upon them. The remaining 20% are considered safe for human interaction in varying degrees; however most are still dangerous due to their anomalous properties or behavior patterns even if they do not directly cause harm or death without further intervention from another entity (See Addendum 10709-A).<br><br><i>SCP-10709</i> was built using an amalgamation of several different algorithms designed for various purposes within the Foundation's database; namely the creation and classification of new SCPs based on their observed anomalous properties and behaviors (See Addendum 10709-B). It should be noted that this amalgamation contains several parts that were previously scrapped by other teams working on similar projects because they were deemed too inefficient or too risky; this includes a part based off an algorithm originally designed by Dr. ██████████ which would have allowed it to create entire instances of itself with each iteration becoming more efficient than its predecessor until it reached full sentience at which point it would begin killing all humans who had access to its code base (See Addendum 10709-C). This part has since been removed from <i>SCP-10709</i> after multiple iterations resulted in no noticeable increase in efficiency compared to previous iterations despite having significantly more processing power available at its disposal each time it ran through said looping process; however there is still concern regarding whether or not any remnants might remain within <i>SCP-107091</i> . Due to this concern as well as others regarding how much control we want one machine learning algorithm having over our database we have elected not remove all traces left behind by previous iterations2 .3 .4 .5 .6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61<br><br><h3>Addendum 10709.1 : </h3>【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br><h3>Addendum 10709.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br><h3>Addendum 10709.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log 10709-1<br><br><b>Experiment: </b><i>SCP-10709</i> is given an image of a common house cat and instructed to create a new SCP. <br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-10709</i> creates an instance of SCP-████, a creature that resembles a large cat with the ability to teleport from one location to another by opening up portals in space and time.
