THIS DOCUMENT IS CLASSIFIED LEVEL 4/9464 !!!<br><br><i>SCP-9464</i> is to be kept in a locked container at Site-19. The object must not come into contact with any electronic device, or any other object that contains electronics. Any personnel who are assigned to work with <i>SCP-9464</i> must wear standard insulated gloves and have all of their clothing rubberized. No personnel may use <i>SCP-9464</i> for an extended period of time, as it has been shown to cause severe mental distress in those exposed for too long.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9464</i> is a standard wooden computer keyboard with Roman letters. When in contact with any electronic device, <i>SCP-9464</i> will cause the contacts on the device to loosen, effectively breaking the circuit. The object has been shown to weaken circuits over time and eventually completely break them.<br><br><i>SCP-9464</i> was given an experimental designation by Dr. ██████ after he started using it as his primary work keyboard at Site-19 . After several days of use, he started having hallucinations of electric wires and other electrical components in his vicinity becoming animated, even when there were none present. He also began to see sparks coming out of outlets on other walls if they were plugged into the wall next to him and began talking about <i>"electricity"</i> that could come out of objects if they were close enough together (See Addendum). After two weeks, Dr. ██████ had a mental breakdown after seeing a wall outlet turn into what he described as <i>"a gaping maw full of electric teeth."</i> He claimed that it was trying to bite him and attack him but refused treatment for PTSD or any kind of therapy because <i>"it can't hurt me anymore."</i> Foundation personnel deemed it necessary to place <i>SCP-9464</i> in containment after this incident so more people wouldn't be exposed to its effects. Once <i>SCP-9464</i> came into contact with Foundation property, all electronics within Site 19 broke down completely (see Test Log 9464).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9464</i> was recovered after Dr. ██████'s mental breakdown and subsequent suicide when the Foundation personnel investigated his workplace to see what caused his breakdown. During this investigation, they found <i>SCP-9464</i> in Dr. ██████'s office, still plugged in and operational.<br><br><br>Test Log 9464:<br><br><br>Experiment Date: ██/██/<br>19██ Experiment: D-4392 was instructed to use <i>SCP-9464</i> for one hour with a standard audio recorder placed next to it for documentation purposes.<br> Results: D-4392 reported hearing voices coming from the recorder telling him that they were going to kill him if he didn't stop using <i>SCP-9464</i> right away and that he wasn't allowed to use it anymore because it belonged to them now. When asked if he could understand any of the voices or if they sounded like anyone specific, D-4392 replied <i>"I'm not sure… It sounded like some kind of language but I can't<br><br><h3>Addendum 9464.1 :</h3><br><br>Dr. ██████, before his suicide and mental break down, claimed to be able to hear voices coming out of the electrical wiring in the walls and even said he could feel it physically moving around in the walls, touching him. He described it as "</i>electricity with a will of its own.<i>" When asked if there was any way he could communicate with this electrical entity or what its intentions were, Dr.<br> ██████ replied: "</i>It speaks to me sometimes… Most of the time I just hear whispers that get louder and louder until they sound like screaming but I can make out words now… It's not electricity anymore… It's people made out of wires…"<br><br><h3>Addendum 9464.2 :</h3></div>
