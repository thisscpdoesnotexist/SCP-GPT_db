Any personnel who come into contact with an individual affected by <i>SCP-17090</i> must wear protective gear and use caution when interacting with them.<br><br>In addition, research is ongoing in order to better understand the cause of <i>SCP-17090</i> and develop a more effective treatment for those affected by it. All test subjects used in any experiments related to <i>SCP-17090</i> must be approved by Site Command before being allowed to participate.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17090</i> is a form of medical therapy that causes an individual's tongue to increase in size. The effects of <i>SCP-17090</i> are not permanent, and the enlarged tongue will eventually return to its original size.<br><br>The cause of <i>SCP-17090</i> is unknown, but it appears to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and exposure to certain environmental factors. It is believed that individuals with certain genetic markers may be more susceptible to <i>SCP-17090</i> than others.<br><br>When exposed to <i>SCP-17090</i>, subjects experience extreme discomfort and pain as their tongues swell rapidly over the course of several minutes. In some cases, subjects have reported difficulty speaking or eating due to the swelling. After approximately one hour, the swelling will begin to subside and the subject's tongue will return back to its normal size within 24 hours after initial exposure.<br><br>Treatment for those affected by <i>SCP-17090</i> consists primarily of pain management medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen along with topical steroids applied directly onto the swollen area on their tongues in order reduce inflammation and ease discomfort during recovery period . If necessary, surgical intervention can also be used if other methods are ineffective at reducing swelling or alleviating symptoms associated with <i>SCP-17090</i> .<br><br><h3>Addendum 17090.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, an individual affected by <i>SCP-17090</i> was found in the city of [REDACTED]. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that this individual had been exposed to a new form of medical therapy known as <i>"tongue enlargement therapy"</i>. The individual had undergone the procedure at a local clinic and reported experiencing extreme discomfort shortly afterwards. It is believed that this clinic may be responsible for other cases of <i>SCP-17090</i>. All personnel involved with the clinic have been detained and are currently being interrogated.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17090.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>████ ███████, the individual responsible for administering <i>"tongue enlargement therapy"</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 17090.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>17090-1: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-17090-1<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-17090</i> and monitored for signs of swelling.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Within minutes, the subject's tongue began to swell rapidly. After approximately one hour, the swelling had begun to subside and the subject's tongue returned back to its normal size within 24 hours after initial exposure.</div>
