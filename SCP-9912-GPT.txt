(<i>SCP-9912</i> pauses for several seconds) <br><br><b><i>SCP-9912</i>: </b>I was in my apartment when it happened…I heard something outside my door so I grabbed my gun and opened it up…there were these things just standing there staring at me so I shot one of them in the head…it didn't even flinch so I shot another one and then another until they all fell down dead . Then suddenly this black smoke started pouring out of their bodies like they were being filled with it or something . It scared me so bad that i dropped my gun which is when i realized that there was some sort of badge on it that hadn't been there before . When i picked up the gun again ,the badge had fused itself onto my hand and wouldn't come off no matter how hard i tried . That's when Holly showed up with her team and took me here afterwards (<i>SCP-9</i> 9 12 pauses for several seconds) <br><br><b>Dr.Valentine: </b>What do you think caused this incident ?
