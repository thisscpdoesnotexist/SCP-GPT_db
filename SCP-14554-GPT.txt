A single gate is to be located at the end of a road leading up to <i>SCP-14554</i>'s property line; this gate must remain locked at all times unless an authorized researcher assigned to Site 23 is entering or exiting <i>SCP-14554</i>. Any unauthorized individuals attempting to enter <i>SCP-14554</i> are not allowed on its grounds under any circumstances and are instructed to immediately leave the area; if they do not comply they are then instructed to call local law enforcement for assistance.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14554</i> is a house in ████████, Texas. <i>SCP-14554</i> was built in the year 19██. <i>SCP-14554</i> was originally owned by Dr. ██████, who lived there with his wife and children until the death of his wife and disappearance of his children in 19██. The events that transpired at <i>SCP-14554</i> are largely unknown to Foundation personnel due to a lack of surviving witnesses, but it is believed that Dr. ██████ murdered both his wife and children before committing suicide himself on the property of <i>SCP-14554</i> soon after their disappearances were discovered by authorities.<br><br><i>SCP-14554</i>'s anomalous effects manifest whenever an individual enters its structure or any part thereof for more than five minutes at a time without permission from an authorized researcher assigned to Site 23 (see Addendum 14554a). These effects include:<br><br>The creation of one or more humanoids within 10 meters of the individual(s) entering <i>SCP-14554</i>'s structure; these humanoids are designated as instances of <i>SCP-14654</i> . Instances will appear as fully formed adult humans wearing clothing appropriate for the current time period (see Addendum 14654b). Instances will be hostile towards all individuals not currently inside their structure unless said individuals have been given permission from an authorized researcher assigned to Site 23 (see Addendum 14654c). If instances are able to physically attack an individual outside their structure they will do so until said individual has been rendered unconscious or dead; if this occurs while said individual is still within 10 meters they will continue attacking them until they exit its property line (See Experiment Log 14654f). If instances are unable to physically attack an individual outside their structure they will attempt to kill them using other means such as blunt force trauma, strangulation, suffocation via drowning , etc.; if this occurs while said individual is still within 10 meters they will continue attempting until either instance(s) or subject expires (See Experiment Log 14654g). When exiting through doors leading outside the property line surrounding its property line all subjects must first pass through another door leading back into it before exiting; failure to do so results in instant death . This effect cannot be circumvented by simply walking around doorways leading out from inside its walls; if done so subjects instantly die upon exiting through any doorway located on its own grounds regardless where they entered from (See Experiment Log 14654h). The interior layout of each instance varies greatly between each instance but always<br><br><h3>Addendum 14554.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 14554.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>+ View Interview Log 14554-1 - Hide Interview Log 14554-1 <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-14654-2, a humanoid instance of <i>SCP-14654</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-14654-2 was discovered in the house's kitchen by Agent ████████ and Dr. ██████ after it had attacked them both inside its structure; it was contained using Class A amnestics and taken into Foundation custody for questioning on the events that transpired at <i>SCP-14554</i> prior to its discovery by Foundation personnel. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So… you were created here as well? D-14654-[DATA <br><br><b>EXPUNGED]: </b>Yes, we were all created here; we're not sure how long ago exactly but we know it's been a while now. I'd say about five years or so? The first few years were spent doing nothing but sitting around in the house waiting for something to happen; then one day some people started showing up outside our walls and they didn't leave until they died or went away on their own accord . That happened over and over again until there wasn't anyone left anymore . Then things got really quiet around here again until you showed up today . We don't like having people show up here without permission from Father, though he does let them come visit sometimes if he feels like letting us out of our rooms for a bit… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Father? You mean Dr. ███████? D-[DATA <br><br><b>EXPUNGED]: </b>No, Father is someone else entirely; he lives upstairs with us and takes care of us when Mother isn't around anymore . He lets us go outside sometimes too when she isn't home but only if she says it's okay first . She never lets us go outside when she is home because she says there are bad people out there who want to hurt us so we have to stay inside where it's safe… Agent [REDACTED] (over radio): Doctor! Where are you guys?! We've got movement coming from inside the house! It looks like more than one this time! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being informed that his wife had been dead since 19██ , D-[DATA EXPUNGED] expired from shock before any more information could be obtained from him regarding <i>SCP-14554</i> or instances of SCP - 1464 4 ; his body was subsequently incinerated after being removed from containment facility 2A at Site 23 due to safety concerns regarding other instances of SCP - 1464 4 potentially attempting revenge against him should they discover his death upon their release into society during future containment breaches caused by SCP - 1 4 554 ' s anomalous effects (See Addendum 1 4 554a). His ashes have since been interred in an unmarked grave located within Site 23 's grounds as per request made before expiring by Agent [REDACTED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 14554.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log 14654f<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14654-1 (22 year old male)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-14654-1 is instructed to enter <i>SCP-14554</i>'s structure through its front door. Once inside he is to walk around the inside of it for five minutes before exiting through one of its rear doors. D-14654-1 does so and then waits outside for five minutes before entering again; this process is repeated until all other subjects have completed their own tests.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After exiting <i>SCP-14554</i>'s structure, D-14654 was found laying on the ground unconscious with multiple lacerations across his body and a broken neck; it appears that while he was within 10 meters of <i>SCP-14554</i> instances of SCP - 14654 were able to attack him despite not being able to physically do so while he was still within it . Upon being woken up and questioned about his experience, subject claimed that while walking around inside said structure he heard voices whispering in an unknown language telling him to kill himself; when asked if these voices sounded human or inhuman subject stated <i>"I don't know… they didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before."</i><br><br></div>
