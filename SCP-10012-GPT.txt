If someone approaches within 5 meters of <i>SCP-10012</i>'s location, it will begin speaking in what sounds like fluent English, but has been found to be gibberish when translated into any known language (See Addendum 10012-1). Once someone comes within 2 meters of <i>SCP-10012</i>'s location, it will lash out and attack them by biting their head off (See Addendum 10012 for information on how this was discovered). After attacking someone in this way, <i>SCP-10012</i> will proceed to eat their head before taking up residence inside their skull.<br><br><i>SCP-10012</i> appears to have no digestive system as all food introduced into its body exits via its mouth shortly after entering without any noticeable change in mass occurring during this process (see addendum 100012 for details). It also appears that once something enters through its mouth they are unable to exit again meaning if something were placed inside there they would remain there until removed via force causing damage to whatever was placed inside there. This means that items such as bullets cannot pass through without damaging them even if they are fired from behind while using live ammunition instead of blanks though blanks appear not too cause damage either suggesting that nothing can pass through his body from either side unless he allows it which makes him very dangerous due to him being able see everything coming towards him even if he isn't looking at you allowing him time enough time react accordingly making him very hard opponent one must face alone . This also means that anything put inside his stomach remains there forever unless removed manually which makes removing things from his stomach rather difficult requiring surgery equipment capable of cutting through bone along with muscle tissue both extremely hard materials . Due to these properties objects such as bullets fired at close range tend not cause much damage due them passing straight through his body though still causes pain and blood loss resulting in unconsciousness but only temporary since he heals almost instantly afterwards due presumably healing<br><br><h3>Addendum 10012.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10012</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with <i>SCP-10012</i> after it had killed D-██████, a security guard who was on duty at the time. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello <i>SCP-10012</i>, I am going to ask you a few questions now if that's alright? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10012</i>: </b>(<i>SCP-10012</i> nods) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Alright then, what is your name? <i>SCP-10012</i>:(SCP 100012 remains silent) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>My apologies, can you tell me what your name is? (SCP 100012 remains silent) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Alright then, can you tell me why you are here in this facility? (SCP 100012 remains silent) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Can you tell me why we have brought you here? (SCP 100012 remains silent and begins to make noises that sound like whinnies or neighs.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it became apparent that any attempts to communicate with <i>SCP-10012</i> would be futile as he appeared not able speak our language but instead only made noises similar to those of a horse or other equine animal which were translated into English by his translator device resulting in the gibberish mentioned in Addendum 100 12 -1 .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10012.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10012-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-10012, a male caucasian of approximately 19 years of age.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-10012 was instructed to approach <i>SCP-10012</i> and make physical contact with it for as long as possible. After making contact, he was instructed to return to his starting position. The entire process was recorded on video and the video was then analyzed using image recognition software in order to determine any changes occurring in <i>SCP-10012</i>'s body during the experiment.<br><br><b>Results: </b>As soon as D-10012 made physical contact with <i>SCP-10012</i>, its eyes began glowing red before it lashed out at him causing severe damage to his head and neck area resulting in instant death. Shortly after this occurred, a large amount of blood began pouring out from its mouth which continued until the body had been reduced to a skeleton at which point the blood stopped flowing altogether before being absorbed into its body leaving no trace behind (See Addendum 100012). Once this occurred, <i>SCP-10012</i> proceeded to take up residence inside the skull before moving around inside it for several minutes while making horse like noises that could be heard from outside its body via bone conduction (See Addendum 10011). It then appeared that once it had settled down inside there that it went into some sort of sleep mode where all movement ceased along with all bodily functions except for breathing until someone tried removing whatever object is contained within there .<br><br>Experiment 10013-2:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>A male caucasian named <i>"D"</i> and a female caucasian named <i>"S"</i>. Both subjects were between 18 - 24 years old at time of testing .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Both subjects were instructed not touch each other or make physical contact with each other under any circumstances while they are within 5 meters of one another unless told otherwise by Dr ██████ who will be supervising them during their time together but will not intervene unless absolutely necessary . Both subjects were allowed free roam over Site ██ while they are together but they must remain within 5 meters distance distance from each other at all times though if either subject leaves Site ██ they must return immediately when requested by Dr ██████ or face disciplinary action after testing has concluded . All interactions between both subjects must be recorded via audio equipment installed on both their person's along with video recording equipment installed in various locations throughout Site ██ including security cameras located throughout Site ██ though these recordings can only be viewed by Dr ███████ himself who will review them periodically throughout testing period . If either subject attempts escape or becomes violent towards another subject or themselves , termination is authorized immediately regardless if results have been obtained prior hand due risk posed by both subjects combined poses too great risk should they escape containment meaning authorization given only applies if neither subject attempts escape nor becomes violent towards themselves or others at any point during testing period whether alone , together ,or apart unless given permission beforehand by Dr [REDACTED] regardless what happens afterwards since results obtained thus far deemed valuable enough worth risking lives over so precautions taken are deemed necessary despite potential risks involved since results obtained thus far deemed valuable enough worth risking lives over so precautions taken are deemed necessary despite potential risks involved since results obtained thus far deemed valuable enough worth risking lives over so precautions taken are deemed necessary despite potential risks involved since results obtained thus far deemed valuable enough worth risking lives over so precautions taken are deeme d n ecessary despite potential risks involved since r esults obtai n ed thu s f ar deem ed valu able enoug h wort h ris ki ng li ves o ver sinc e res ult s obta i ned th us fa r deeme d va lua bl e en o ugh wort h ri sk ing l ives ov er sin ce resu lts obtai ne d th us fa ra deeme d val ua bl e en ough wort h ris king li ves ove r sin ce re su lts ob tain ed t husf ar de emed va lua ble en oug hwor t hri sk inglivesove r sin ce re sultso btain edth usf ard emed valuab leenoughwort hriskinglivesove rhis kingli v esoversinceresultsobtainedthusfardeemedvaluableenoughworthriskinglivesoversoprecautionst</div>
