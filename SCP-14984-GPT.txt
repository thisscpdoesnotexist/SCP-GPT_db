I'm a bubble gum. <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Can you tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14984</i>: </b>Yes! My name is Bubble Gum! <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Alright then… Can you tell me how you got here? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14984</i>: </b>I was blown by a kid named ████ ██████ when he was in his birthday party. He blew the balloon and the balloon exploded in his face and killed him because of my powers. <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>How can you blow a balloon with bubble gum? You're an anomaly, not an anomaly that can blow balloons with it's bubble gum. <i>SCP-14984</i> is silent for 3 seconds before bursting into laughter for 7 seconds . After that, it stops laughing and resumes talking . <br><br><b><i>SCP-14984</i>: </b>Hahahahahahahahaha! That's funny! I am an anomaly that can blow balloons with it's bubble gum! Hahaha!!!<br><br><h3>Addendum 14984.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 14984-01<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14984</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-14984</i> was given to D-class personnel for testing. The subject was instructed to blow a balloon with it, and then report its findings. The subject did so, and then reported that the balloon exploded after being blown up for approximately two minutes. After this, the subject reported that the bubble gum became normal again. However, when the subject tried to blow a balloon with it again, it exploded immediately upon contact with air . When asked about what happened, the subject claimed that he had not blown a balloon with it at all .<br><br>Experiment #: 14984-02<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14984</i> (replica) . Subject was placed in an airtight room along with an explosive device capable of detecting any changes in air pressure within five meters of itself (the same type used by Foundation agents when they are trying to detect if there is anyone inside of an area). The explosive device was set up outside of <i>SCP-14984</i>'s containment chamber , and its readings were monitored by video camera from another room adjacent to <i>SCP-14984</i>'s containment chamber . At exactly 5 P M , the explosive device detected changes in air pressure consistent with blowing a large bubblegum bubble , which lasted for approximately one minute before abruptly stopping without causing any other changes in air pressure within five meters of itself.<br><br></div>
