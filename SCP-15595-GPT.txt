Testing with <i>SCP-15595</i> is currently suspended by order of the Ethics Committee pending review.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15595</i> is a bag of misfortune cookies, which are packaged in the style of ████████ brand cookies. <i>SCP-15595</i> is capable of producing an infinite amount of cookies, which have the following effects:<br><br><b><i>SCP-15595</i>-1: </b>A small cookie shaped like an arrowhead. When consumed by a human being, it will cause them to be struck by a random misfortune. The type and severity of this misfortune vary greatly between subjects; some examples include but are not limited to: sudden death via heart attack or stroke, spontaneous combustion, spontaneous amputation (of limbs), violent allergic reaction causing death via suffocation or asphyxiation, and spontaneous combustion.<br><br><i>SCP-15595</i> was discovered after reports from ████████ brand cookie consumers began to surface regarding instances where they were struck by random misfortunes after consuming their products. After tracking down these individuals and questioning them about their consumption habits with regard to <i>SCP-15595</i> products , it was determined that all had purchased these items from the same store in [REDACTED]. Foundation personnel were sent in under cover as employees for said business and recovered <i>SCP-15595</i> for containment purposes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15595.1 : </h3>██/██/████<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So, what do you think of the cookies? Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>I don't know, they taste alright but I'm not sure about the whole…you know… [points to <i>SCP-15595</i>] thing. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Yes, well that's why we're here today. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Right, right. So how does this work exactly? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well it's pretty simple really; you just have to eat one of those cookies and see what happens! Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Yeah but which one? They all look pretty much the same to me other than that arrowhead thing on them… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well if you'd like my opinion I'd say try this one right here [indicates <i>SCP-15595</i>-1]. It looks like it has the most interesting effects according to our notes anyway; especially since those reports we got from your fellow agents were quite varied in their descriptions of misfortune occurrences . Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Alright then, let's get on with it then! [Agent consumes <i>SCP-15595</i>-1] Dr . <br><br><b>█████: </b>And now what are your thoughts? <br><br><b>Agent: </b>My thoughts are that I feel fine and dandy and nothing bad has happened so far! In fact nothing bad ever happens around me at all , no matter how many times people try to kill me ! That's a little weird if you ask me but whatever is fine by me ! Dr . W e l l t h a t s g o o d a n y w a y b e c a u s e i f n o t h i n g b i g o r b i g j u s t p r o v e s t h a t w e ' r e n 't doing our jobs properly around here so there needs to be some changes made starting with more funding for research into these cookies because they seem really important somehow or something…<br><br><h3>Addendum 15595.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████, CEO of ████████ brand cookies<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Dr. █████████ and Agent █████████ were sent to interview Mr. ████████ regarding <i>SCP-15595</i>'s origins and production methods. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr .

A ge nt: N ot rea ll y, we just want to know how you got your hands on it in the first place an then maybe we'll see about letting you go free after that…or maybe not if you don't cooperate with us! [Agent takes out handgun] Mr . S orr y gu es ss om eth ing's gone wrong here! Didn't anyone read the fine print on those things? They're dangerous ! You can't just let people eat them willy-nilly without knowing what they'll do! We never intended for these things to be sold outside our company but somehow they got leaked out into the public market and now people are getting hurt because of them! D r . W el l I'm sure there must be some kind of regulation against selling food products that are potentially harmful to consumers…Mr. Well yes but it doesn't really apply here since these products have been discontinued for quite some time now; besides which this isn't about regulations; this is about saving lives ! Agent So why did you make them in the first place then if they're so dangerous ? Mr It was an accident mostly; one day one of our engineers accidentally spilled some chemical into the mix while he was making cookies for his kid's birthday party and well…that's how these things came into existence. We tried everything we could think of to get rid of them but nothing worked so eventually we decided just to keep them around as part of our collection instead since they were pretty interesting anyway …and then someone stole all those items from us including <i>SCP-15595</i> which has been missing ever since …but anyway enough chit chat; let me go now please ? D r Ok, ok calm down sir ; we'll let you go right away if you answer one more question for us…which ingredients did your engineer use when he spilled chemicals onto his cookie batter? Mr Oh come on man , why do you need something like that!? Can't I go now?! D r Please sir ; it will only take another minute or two at most…we promise! [Agent gestures towards gun] M R Ok fine …he used uhm….salt, baking soda, eggs (chicken), flour (wheat), milk (cow), butter (cow)….oh wait hold on let me check my notes real quick….I think there might have been something else too..hmm…..ah yes here it is: cinnamon (cassia) ! That should be all right shouldn't it? Agent Yes sir , thank you very much for your cooperation today; perhaps next time we won't have to resort to such measures though eh? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The above information regarding <i>SCP-15595</i>'s ingredients has proven invaluable in determining its origin as well as its effects upon consumption by human beings .
