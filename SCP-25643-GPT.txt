It only existed in 1904</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-25643<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Thaumiel<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-25643</i> is a temporal anomaly that exists on November 31st, 1904. It consists of an infinite loop of events occurring in the same timeframe and location, which repeats itself every 24 hours.<br><br>The anomaly was first discovered when Foundation personnel noticed a large number of people gathering in the same area for unknown reasons on November 31st, 1904. Upon further investigation it was revealed that these individuals were partaking in various activities such as dancing, singing, and playing games. These activities would continue without interruption until midnight at which point everyone would suddenly vanish from sight only to reappear again exactly 24 hours later to repeat the cycle anew.<br><br>It has been determined that all participants are unaware of the anomalous nature of their actions or even that they are repeating them day after day. Furthermore no one has any recollection of what happened during previous cycles nor do they seem capable of breaking out from the loop by choice or force. The only way out appears to be through a breach in reality caused by outside interference such as teleportation or time travel technology.<br><br>In addition to this phenomenon there have also been reports of strange phenomena manifesting within <i>SCP-25643</i>'s area including objects appearing and disappearing randomly as well as other unexplained occurrences such as ghostly apparitions and voices coming from nowhere in particular . All attempts at researching these phenomena have so far proven fruitless due to their unpredictable nature and lack of consistency between cycles . <br><br>It is currently theorized that <i>SCP-25643</i> may be related somehow with [REDACTED], but further research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn . <br><br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-25643</i>, it is impossible to contain or control it directly. As such, Foundation personnel are to monitor the area and take note of any changes in activity or phenomena that may occur within its boundaries.<br><br>In addition, all attempts at breaching reality within <i>SCP-25643</i>'s area are strictly prohibited as doing so could have unpredictable consequences on both the anomaly itself and our timeline . <br><br>Any individuals who manage to escape from <i>SCP-25643</i> must be detained for questioning and amnesticized if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25643.1: </h3> On December 1st, 1904, a group of Foundation personnel managed to breach reality within <i>SCP-25643</i>'s area and escape from the anomaly. They reported that while inside the anomaly they experienced intense feelings of déjà vu and had difficulty distinguishing between events that were happening in real time and those that were repeating themselves over again. Furthermore it appears that their presence caused some minor changes to occur such as objects appearing or disappearing randomly or certain individuals behaving differently than usual .<br><br><h3> Addendum 25643.2: </h3> Interview with a Participant<br><br>On November 30th, 1904 Foundation personnel managed to capture one of the participants in <i>SCP-25643</i>'s loop and interrogate them. The individual, who identified themselves as [REDACTED], claimed to have been living in the area for over two years and had no recollection of how they got there or why they were participating in the anomaly's activities. They also stated that while they had noticed strange occurrences happening around them every day they never thought much about it until now. <br><br>When asked if there was any way to break out from <i>SCP-25643</i>'s loop [REDACTED] replied that it was impossible as everyone seemed bound by some unknown force preventing them from leaving. They then went on to explain that their only hope for escape was to find someone or something that could break the cycle from the outside. <br><br>After further questioning [REDACTED] stated that they had heard rumors of a mysterious figure that appeared in the area every so often and seemed to be able to manipulate time and space. They also claimed to have seen this figure on several occasions but were unable to get close enough for a good look before it vanished again. <br><br>It is currently unknown if this figure has any connection to <i>SCP-25643</i> or if it exists at all. Further research is needed in order to determine the truth behind these rumors.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25643.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to determine the nature of <i>SCP-25643</i>'s boundary. A D-Class personnel was sent through a portal created within the anomaly and instructed to remain in place until midnight. When the time came, all traces of the subject vanished from sight and no further contact could be established. The experiment concluded that breaching reality within <i>SCP-25643</i>'s area is possible but highly dangerous due to its unpredictable nature .</div>
