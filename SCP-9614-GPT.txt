All i remember is that my job was to fix a broken computer and then it all went black after that .<br> Doctor ████: You mean like an out of body experience? <<i>SCP-9614</i> nods> You are not from this dimension are you Mr.Young ? <<i>SCP-964</i> shakes his head left and right> What happened during the containment breach ? <<i>SCP-964</i> shows signs of anger on his face>. They gave me orders to fix their damn computers and then they broke out of their cells! Then they tried to kill each other! And now look at all these people dead because of them! (Shows signs of sadness). This should have never happened !<br> Doctor ████ : Why were they fighting each other anyway ?<<br>SCP note : It appears as if SCP had some sort of fit when he said 'them' he seems like he wants nothing more than killing them . ><br> SCP - 9 6 1 : One man with a gun wanted to take over the facility by force but another man with rare powers thought otherwise , so instead one shot him in cold blood without even listening to reason . After that chaos just took place , everyone just started killing each other for no apparent reason . Now there's no turning back . There's no way we can treat this kind of wounds , only thing we can do now is bury our fallen colleagues with dignity along with fixing the damages done by these maniacs before it gets worse than it already has become !</End log><br><br><h3>Addendum 9614.2 :</h3> Incident Log<br><br>Incident - 9614.1: On ██/██/████ , <i>SCP-9614</i> breached containment by disassembling the room he was contained in, as well as his own body. Once <i>SCP-9614</i> was reassembled with his body and room, he started to look around frantically and started to scream at the top of his lungs. He then started to attack everything electronic in Site 15 with a large screw driver. After breaching containment for about 30 minutes , 3 armed guards were sent in to stop him from causing any more destruction . The guards shot him 5 times with tranquilizers and sedatives but it was ineffective on <i>SCP-9614</i> . Since there were no other options left on hand , they had no choice but to terminate him . After about an hour of being terminated, he ceased all anomalous properties and went back into containment successfully.<br><br>Incident - 9614.<br>2: Containment breach at Site 15: On ██/██/████ a group of armed personnel broke out from their cells during an inspection by O5 command staff members (See Document #09721). The group thought that they discovered proof that they were living within someone's dream, so they decided that killing each other is the only way out since one cannot wake up from a dream if one kills oneself or others within it would not die in real life since this is just a dream.<End Log></div>
