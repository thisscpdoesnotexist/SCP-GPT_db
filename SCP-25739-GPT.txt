    <center> <h3> SCP-25739 is  Athena and Amaterasu's adoptive daughter  </h3> </center>
    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-25739</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25739 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.7 meters in height, with physical features that are an amalgamation of ancient Greek and Japanese iconography. The entity identifies itself as the adoptive offspring of deities Athena and Amaterasu, which correspond to mythological figures from Greek and Japanese cultures, respectively.</p>
<p>SCP-25739 possesses an unusual blend of abilities that seem to originate from both cultural mythos. From the Greek side, SCP-25739 exhibits remarkable strategic acumen, wisdom in decision-making, and skill in battle, especially in hand-to-hand combat using a spear and shield. From the Japanese influence, SCP-25739 can manipulate light, producing blinding flashes or soothing glows, and demonstrates a deep connection to sun imagery.</p>
<p>SCP-25739 was discovered in [REDACTED], where it was residing in an ancient temple that had hitherto been hidden from modern detection. It appears to be benevolent in nature but has displayed distress and volatile behavior when its lineage is questioned or disrespected.</p>
<p>SCP-25739 requires little in terms of sustenance but has shown a preference for offerings similar to those given to Greek and Shinto deities. It communicates fluently in both Ancient Greek and Classical Japanese, as well as in modern English, although with a formal and archaic tone.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-25739 is currently housed in a specially constructed containment chamber that reflects a synthesis of Greek temple and Shinto shrine architectures to maintain the entity's psychological well-being. The chamber is located within Site-[REDACTED].</p>
<p>Personnel interacting with SCP-25739 must demonstrate knowledge of both Greek and Shinto religious practices and show respect towards the entity's cultural background. Physical engagement is prohibited unless SCP-25739 initiates or consents to such action, considering its combat abilities.</p>
<p>Ritualistic offerings must be presented twice a day corresponding to sunrise and sunset, conforming to the traditions SCP-25739 has identified with. Additionally, psychological counseling is provided on a weekly basis to monitor SCP-25739's mental state and mitigate any distress.</p>
<p>In the case of containment breach, non-lethal measures have been prioritized for recontainment due to SCP-25739's general non-hostility and the potential cultural and religious fallout that could result from harm coming to the entity.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Report</h3>
<p>SCP-25739 came to the attention of the Foundation through the interception of communications between local archaeologists who stumbled upon the previously concealed temple. A containment team was immediately dispatched to secure SCP-25739 and transport it to Site-[REDACTED].</p>
<p>Upon initial containment, SCP-25739 was compliant but vocal about its desire to return to the temple. It has since resigned itself to containment, expressing understanding of the Foundation's role in preserving normalcy, but continues to express a longing for its place of origin.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<p><em>See attached document SCP-25739-Exp-Log-A for full experimental procedures and results.</em></p>
<p>The following is an abridged version of the experiment log highlighting key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-25739 showed an adeptness for tactical games and puzzles, outperforming Foundation researchers consistently.</li>
<li>Light manipulation abilities were tested; SCP-25739 demonstrated fine control over intensity and duration of luminescence.</li>

<h3>Addendum 3: Interview Log</h3>
<p><em>Full transcript of Interview SCP-25739-Int-A available upon request.</em></p>
<p><strong><Excerpt Start></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yuna:</strong> How do you perceive your existence in relation to the figures considered your adoptive parents?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-25739:</strong> I am the progeny of wisdom and the sun. My purpose is to illuminate the path of righteousness and to strategize against the looming darkness. Athena and Amaterasu bestowed their favor upon me - a mortal once - to carry on their will.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yuna:</strong> And do you remember your time before your... adoption?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-25739:</strong> Faintly. I was of those who devoted their lives to the pantheon, a guardian of the sacred. My previous life was as a vessel for their influence, a prelude to my transformation. But those memories are but whispers now.</p>
<p><strong><Excerpt End></strong></p>
<p>The interview suggests that SCP-25739 may have been a human devotee or priest(ess) before its current state. Further investigation into historical records of the area where SCP-25739 was found is ongoing to ascertain any truth behind this claim.</p></div>
