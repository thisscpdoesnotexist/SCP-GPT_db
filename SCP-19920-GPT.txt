Its fur is white with grey and black stripes, and its eyes are green. Its most notable feature is that it wields a Glock 19 pistol in its mouth at all times.<br><br>The gun appears to be nonfunctional, as no ammunition or magazine can be found inside it when examined by personnel. Despite this, <i>SCP-19920</i> has been observed firing the weapon on several occasions; however, the bullets fired appear to be made of an unknown material which does not cause any damage upon impact with solid objects or living organisms.<br><br><i>SCP-19920</i> displays sapience beyond that of normal cats; it understands human speech and can respond accordingly in English, though its speech patterns are highly distorted due to being spoken through a firearm muzzle instead of vocal cords. It claims to have been created by an entity known only as “the Creator” for some unknown purpose; further questioning on this topic results in hostile behavior from <i>SCP-19920</i> towards personnel attempting such inquiries.<br><br>When provoked or threatened by other creatures (including humans), <i>SCP-19920</i> will become hostile and will attempt to use its firearm against them if possible; however, due to the lack of functional ammunition within the weapon no harm will come from these attempts unless physical contact occurs between <i>SCP-19920</i> and another creature during such events.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19920</i> is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at all times, with the door locked and monitored by security personnel. No personnel are to enter the chamber without authorization from Level 4 personnel or higher.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential hostile behavior from <i>SCP-19920</i>, it is to be provided with a constant supply of food and water as well as toys and other items that can help keep it entertained. Personnel interacting with <i>SCP-19920</i> must remain calm and respectful at all times; any attempts at questioning its origin or purpose are strictly forbidden.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19920.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-19920</i> was observed speaking in a language which has yet to be identified; however, the words spoken were determined to be “The Creator is coming.” No other information on this matter has been obtained since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19920.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19920</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-19920</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-19920</i>. Can you tell me about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19920</i>:</b> I am the creation of a higher being known only as <i>"the Creator"</i>. He created me to be his weapon, and I am here to do his bidding.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> What is your purpose? Why did he create you? <br><b><br> <i>SCP-19920</i>:</b> To protect him from those who would seek to harm him or his work. He has given me this gun so that I can defend him.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19920.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-19920</i><br><b>Procedure:</b> To test the effects of physical contact with <i>SCP-19920</i>, a D-Class personnel was instructed to approach it and attempt to pet it.<br><b>Results:</b> Upon contact with the D-Class personnel, <i>SCP-19920</i> immediately fired its weapon at them; however, due to the lack of functional ammunition within the gun no harm was caused. The D-Class personnel then attempted to flee from <i>SCP-19920</i>, but was quickly subdued by the cat’s superior strength and agility. After several minutes of struggling against <i>SCP-19920</i>’s grip on them, they were finally able to break free and escape from the containment chamber unharmed.</div>
