The man was described as being kind and loving to his family. However, when he became sick with cancer he could no longer afford treatment and died shortly after.<br><br><i>SCP-15007</i> manifests at night when it is dark outside and there are people around that are feeling lonely or depressed. When this happens <i>SCP-15007</i> will appear as an ordinary streetlight until someone approaches it . When someone gets close enough to <i>SCP-15007</i> it will change into a human form of the man that used to be <i>SCP-15007</i> before he died . It will then ask if anyone wants any help finding their way home or if they need any help with anything else . If anyone asks for help from 15107 then they will disappear without a trace along with 15107 itself . Anyone who asks for help from 15107 has not been seen again since their disappearance . If no one asks for help from 15107 then it will just walk around town aimlessly until sunrise , whereupon it returns to its original form as an ordinary streetlight before disappearing altogether .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15007.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-15007</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15007</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello <i>SCP-15007</i>. My name is Dr. ██████ and I'd like to ask you a few questions about yourself if that's alright with you . <br><br><b><i>SCP-15007</i>: </b>Sure, I don't mind . Why do you want to know about me? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well, we found out that your streetlight form has been causing a lot of people to disappear around here so we just want to know what happened . <br><br><b><i>SCP-15007</i>: </b>Oh… I see… <SCP- 15007 pauses for a moment before continuing > Well, when I was alive my family and I were very poor so we could barely afford anything and it was hard on us all the time , but there was one thing that kept me going through everything , it was my daughter , she meant the world to me and she always made sure that everyone in our family had everything they needed even if it meant having nothing herself . She looked up at me as her hero because of how much pain she saw in my eyes every day , she would try her hardest everyday just so she could make sure that everyone else around her had what they needed while still trying not to worry too much about herself ….. But then one day after school when she came home from school with some friends they told her something horrible … They told her how sick I really was … And how there wasn't anything anyone could do for me anymore … They said this would be the last time they would ever see each other again because soon after this day no one would remember any of them ever existing at all .. And now every night when its dark outside these kids come back out looking for help from someone who can never give them any help at all because none of them are real anymore … So every night when its dark outside these kids come back out looking for help from someone who can never give them any help at all because none of them are real anymore .. <SCP - 15 007 begins crying uncontrollably ><br><br><h3>Addendum 15007.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15007-1 , a 32 year old male .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to approach <i>SCP-15007</i> and ask for help finding his way home . Subject was then instructed to follow 15107 if it offered to help him .<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-15007</i> turned into a human form of the man that had once been <i>SCP-15007</i>. It then told D-15007 that he could help him find his way home if he wanted to. When D-15007 agreed, 15107 led him out of the testing area and towards the exit. However, when they reached the exit they found themselves in an empty field with no sign of Site ██ or any other buildings nearby whatsoever. After several minutes of wandering around trying to find their way back neither subject nor object could be found again as they both simply vanished without a trace .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Based on this experiment it is assumed that anyone who asks for assistance from <i>SCP-15007</i> will end up in an alternate dimension where there are no buildings or people anywhere near them at all , most likely due to 15107 taking them away from civilization itself .<br><br>Experiment #: 2</div>
