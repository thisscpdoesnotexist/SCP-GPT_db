Testing with <i>SCP-15557</i> is currently suspended pending further research into its origins and possible connection to other similar cases around Australia.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15557</i> is a chemical compound that induces an abnormal state of consciousness in human beings when ingested. This state is characterized by a complete loss of the sense of self and an inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy. The subject will begin to experience hallucinations, which are often accompanied by delusions or paranoia.<br><br>The subject's mental state will deteriorate over time until they become completely unresponsive to external stimuli. This stage can last anywhere from several hours to several days, depending on the dosage taken and the physical health of the subject prior to exposure. Once this stage has passed, <i>SCP-15557</i>'s effects will wear off completely and the subject will regain their senses within 24 hours . However, even after recovery from <i>SCP-15557</i>'s effects subjects have been shown to display symptoms consistent with schizophrenia for up to 3 months after exposure . These symptoms include auditory hallucinations , disorganized speech patterns , paranoia , delusions , catatonia , depression , anxiety disorders and suicidal ideation .<br><br><i>SCP-15557</i> was first discovered in ████████, Australia on ██/██/20██ when reports surfaced that a local man had been acting strangely near his home for several days before disappearing entirely . An investigation was launched into his disappearance which led authorities back towards his home where they found him lying motionless in his backyard surrounded by various pieces of scrap metal he had apparently attempted to assemble into some sort of sculpture while under its influence . The man was taken into custody where he remained unconscious until shortly after <i>SCP-15557</i> wore off 3 days later at which point he regained consciousness but refused any further interviews regarding his experience under its influence . He immediately requested legal counsel upon regaining consciousness but has since gone missing again prompting further investigation into its origins as well as a possible link between it and other similar cases around Australia involving other individuals who have disappeared under similar circumstances over the past year or so (See Addendum 15557 -1)<br><br><h3>Addendum 15557.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted shortly after the subject regained consciousness following exposure to <i>SCP-15557</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello, Mr. ██████, I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened while you were under the influence of <i>SCP-15557</i>. Subject appears visibly distressed and begins to perspire heavily before responding in a hoarse voice . <br><br><b>Subject: </b>I don't… I don't remember anything… it's all just… gone… Dr. ███: Please try to remain calm, Mr. ██████, we already know what happened while you were under its influence so there's no need for you to hide anything from us at this point . Subject becomes visibly agitated and begins speaking rapidly without making any attempt at forming complete sentences . <br><br><b>Subject: </b>No! It's all gone ! You can't make me remember ! We're not going back there ! Never again ! You can't make me go back there ! Not again !! Dr . ███: Please calm down , Mr . … The subject suddenly becomes unresponsive as his breathing becomes labored and irregular , he then vomits several times before collapsing onto the floor unconscious once more . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After regaining consciousness following exposure <i>SCP-15557</i> , subject refused further interviews regarding his experience under its influence claiming that he could not remember anything that had occurred during this time period and did not wish to be forced into remembering it by any means necessary ( See Addendum 15557 -2)<br><br><h3>Addendum 15557.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 15557-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-4578, a 38 year old Caucasian male. Prior to experimentation he was in good health with no history of mental illness . He has also never taken any illicit drugs before.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-4578 was given a dose of <i>SCP-15557</i> and observed for several hours until it wore off. Afterwards he was questioned about his experience under its influence . Excerpts from the interview have been included below for your convenience. <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr ██████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Alright, can you tell me what happened? <br><br><b>D-4578: </b>I don't really know… I remember being outside and then suddenly I wasn't anymore… And then there were these people all around me and they were talking but I couldn't hear them or see them properly… It's like they weren't even there… And then there were these shapes moving all around me but whenever I tried to look at them they would just disappear or move away , so eventually I just gave up trying to look at anything because nothing made sense anymore… It's like my mind had completely shut down on me or something, it's hard to explain really but that's how it felt anyway… Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>What did you see during this time? <br><br><b>D-4578: </b>Nothing much really, just shapes moving around in the distance and stuff like that , not sure what else though because everything looked so weird while it was happening , kinda hard to describe actually... (D-4578 pauses) …It kind of reminded me of when we used to go camping as kids back when mum was still alive with dad before she died you know? We'd spend the night out in the woods looking up at the stars together every now and again and sometimes dad would point out a few constellations if we could find any that night just so we could learn more about space together as a family which is something we always loved doing together as a family... It made us feel closer somehow even though mum wasn't there anymore because she had died earlier on that year from cancer which is why dad started drinking more after she passed away which eventually led him into an accident with one of his co workers who got killed instead leaving him crippled for life afterwards forcing us into poverty where mum couldn't afford her medication anymore forcing her into depression causing her suicide later on down the road leading up towards our eventual homelessness where things started getting worse for us day by day until dad ended up dying from alcohol overdose leaving only myself behind without anyone else left in my family besides myself alone feeling lost without anyone else left behind except myself alone feeling lost inside this world full of nothingness inside this world full of nothingness filled with emptiness filled with emptiness surrounded by darkness surrounded by darkness unable to escape unable to escape trapped within my own head trapped within my own head forced into isolation forced into isolation living forever living forever wandering aimlessly wandering aimlessly searching endlessly searching endlessly waiting hopelessly waiting hopelessly hoping desperately hoping desperately praying hopelessly praying hopelessly screaming silently screaming silently crying uncontrollably crying uncontrollably begging pitifully begging pitifully pleading pathetically pleading pathetically wailing loudly wailing loudly yet no one hears yet no one hears completely alone completely alone forever forever <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being questioned further about his experience under <i>SCP-15557</i>'s effects D - 45 78 became unresponsive prompting medical intervention shortly after . An autopsy revealed severe brain damage consistent with repeated blunt force trauma resulting from numerous self inflicted blows delivered over time against various parts throughout his body using various pieces scrap metal found near SCP - 15 5 57 ' s initial discovery site .
