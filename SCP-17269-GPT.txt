<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17269 is  A suicidal indestructible piece of cake</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17269<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17269</i> is a single piece of cake approximately 30 cm in diameter. The cake appears to be composed of yellow sponge cake with white frosting and rainbow sprinkles, though it does not appear to have any actual nutritional value.<br><br>The anomalous property of <i>SCP-17269</i> is that it displays suicidal tendencies, attempting to harm itself whenever possible. This includes trying to jump off surfaces, hitting itself against walls or other objects, and even attempting to swallow sharp objects. Despite this behavior, the cake remains completely indestructible; no matter how much damage it inflicts upon itself, the cake always returns back into its original form after a few minutes.<br><br>Despite its lack of sentience or sapience, <i>SCP-17269</i> will respond positively when interacted with in a friendly manner; it will move closer towards individuals who show kindness towards it and attempt to cuddle up against them as if seeking comfort from them. It has also been observed that the longer an individual interacts with <i>SCP-17269</i> in such a way the more docile its behavior becomes until eventually ceasing all attempts at self-harm altogether.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17269</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at all times. Personnel interacting with <i>SCP-17269</i> must do so in a friendly manner, and are to be monitored for any adverse effects.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-17269</i> begins exhibiting suicidal behavior again, personnel are to attempt to comfort it until its behavior returns back to normal.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17269.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17269</i> was found in a bakery located in ███████, Germany. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the cake had been baked by an individual known as <i>"Hans"</i> who had committed suicide shortly after baking the cake. It is unknown how or why he was able to create such an anomalous object.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17269.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17269</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17269</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17269</i>.
