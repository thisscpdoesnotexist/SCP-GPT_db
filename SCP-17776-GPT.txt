The process begins with the subject being placed in a standard containment chamber and connected to an electronic device, referred to as the Compression Unit (CU). Once the CU is activated, it will begin to compress the subject's body until they are reduced to a small file size.<br><br>Once compressed, <i>SCP-17776</i> will create a .zip file containing all of the subject's data, including their genetic information and memories. This file can then be transferred onto any computer or storage device without issue. When opened on another computer or device, the contents of this zip file can be used to reconstruct an exact replica of the original person in physical form.<br><br>The process of compression is reversible; however, there have been reports of memory loss among subjects who have undergone decompression from <i>SCP-17776</i>. It is not currently known if this phenomenon occurs due to some inherent property within <i>SCP-17776</i> itself or if it is caused by something else entirely. Further research into this matter has been deemed necessary before further use of <i>SCP-17776</i> can be authorized.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17776</i> is to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17776</i> and its associated components is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. All testing involving <i>SCP-17776</i> must be approved by the Site Director before it can proceed.<br><br>Any personnel found attempting unauthorized use of <i>SCP-17776</i> will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17776.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17776</i> on non-human subjects. A chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was placed in the containment chamber and connected to the CU. The compression process proceeded as normal, resulting in a .zip file containing all of the subject's data.<br><br>When opened on another computer or device, this zip file could be used to reconstruct an exact replica of the chimpanzee in physical form. However, upon decompression, it was discovered that the replicated chimpanzee had undergone an unexpected transformation; its body had become that of a human being. Further testing is required before any conclusions can be made regarding this phenomenon.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17776.2: </h3> Interview with Subject 17776-A<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-17776-A, a female human subject who was successfully compressed and decompressed using <i>SCP-17776</i>.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████, Site Director of Site ██.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br> Dr. ████:</b> How are you feeling?<br><b><br> D-17776-A:</b> I'm… okay, I guess. A little disoriented but otherwise alright.<br><b><br> Dr. ████:</b> That's understandable given the circumstances. Can you tell me what happened during the compression process?<br><b><br> D-17776-A:</b> It felt like my body was being squeezed in on itself until there was nothing left but a tiny file… it was strange, but not painful.<br><b><br> Dr. ████:</b> And after decompression? Did you experience any side effects?<br><b><br> D-17776-A:</b> Yeah, I feel like some of my memories are missing… it's like there are gaps in my mind that I can't fill.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> Subject D-17776-A was administered a Class A amnestic and released from containment. Further testing of <i>SCP-17776</i> has been suspended until further research into the memory loss phenomenon can be conducted.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17776.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #1 - Subject:</b> D-5678<br><b><br>Result:</b> Successful. Subject was successfully compressed into a .zip file and decompressed without any memory loss or physical damage.<br><b><br>Test #2 - Subject:</b> D-9012<br><b><br>Result:</b> Successful. Subject was successfully compressed into a .zip file and decompressed without any memory loss or physical damage. However, the subject reported feeling <i>"disoriented"</i> upon being returned to their original form. Further testing is needed to determine if this is an effect of <i>SCP-17776</i> or not.</div>
