The containment chamber is to be lined with several layers of soundproofing material, and the walls are to be padded with several layers of rubber padding . <i>SCP-15249</i>'s containment chamber is not to have any holes or openings in it, and all personnel entering the room are required to wear ear protection at all times while inside.<br><br><i>SCP-15249</i> is currently being held at Site-███ in ██████ County, Wisconsin , where it will remain until further notice . Any residents who claim that they hear scratching noises coming from their homes are to be administered Class C amnestics and released back into society.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15249</i> is a mole that can not be seen by any means. <i>SCP-15249</i> always appears to be digging, and will appear to have dug through solid matter. <i>SCP-15249</i> is not affected by any known physical force, and has been shown to burrow through large objects such as the Berlin Wall and the Great Pyramid of Giza.<br><br><i>SCP-15249</i>'s appearance changes depending on what it is looking at. When looking at a person or object, it appears as an average sized mole with brown fur. When looking at a wall or ground, it appears as an extremely large creature with grey skin and claws on its paws .<br><br><i>SCP-15249</i> has only been observed in one <br><br><b>location: </b>A small town located in ██████ County, Wisconsin called <i>"██████"</i>. The town itself was established around 18██ under the name <i>"██████"</i>, but was later changed after residents began reporting strange activity occurring within their homes. Residents reported hearing scratching noises coming from within their walls late at night , which would cause them to become paranoid about having moles living within their homes . This continued for several years until 19██ when several residents began noticing that they had no more food left in their kitchens than they did before they went shopping earlier that day . The Foundation was alerted after reports of these events were reported by local news stations , leading them to investigate the town under the guise of pest control professionals . Upon arrival , residents were interviewed about whether or not there were any creatures living inside of their homes , most responding with negative results . However , upon further investigation into one resident's home (Resident █████████), several dead mice were found scattered across his kitchen floor along with claw marks on his walls near where he claimed he heard scratching noises coming from . Further investigation led them to find <i>SCP-15249</i> beneath his house digging through dirt underneath his foundation . After being exposed , <i>SCP-15249</i> attempted to dig its way out but was quickly apprehended by MTF units before escaping containment due to its ability to burrow through solid matter without leaving behind any traces of itself doing so, making tracking it down nearly impossible without direct visual contact (See Addendum 1524).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15249.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview took place shortly after <i>SCP-15249</i> was apprehended by MTF units. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████, I'm here to ask you a few questions about the mole that you claim is living in your basement . <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Yeah , sure , anything to help get rid of it . I just want my house back to normal again . <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Alright then . When did you first notice that there was something wrong with your home ? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>It all started when I noticed some holes in my walls during the day while I was at work . At first , I thought nothing of it and just assumed they were made by mice or rats or something like that until one night when i heard scratching noises coming from inside my walls while i was trying to sleep and it kept me up for hours on end until i finally fell asleep around 4 AM . The next morning , when i woke up and looked at the clock next to me , it said 9 AM which confused me because there's no way that could have been right since i went straight to bed after hearing those noises last night but then my wife told me she had woken up around 6 AM so she must've been mistaken about what time she woke up because she didn't hear any noises coming from anywhere but her room so maybe its just her who heard them? It wasn't until a few days later when we found dead mice scattered across our kitchen floor along with claw marks near where we claimed we heard scratching noises coming from before we realized what these things actually were - <br><br><b><i>SCP-15249</i>: </b>Dr. █████████ (whispering): [What?] Agent [REDACTED] (whispering): [I think he's talking about <i>SCP-15249</i>.] <br><br><b>Dr. [REDACTED]: </b>What? You mean this thing is real? Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Yes, sir, this thing has been living under his house for years now without him knowing about it ever since he moved here 5 years ago during his sophomore year of high school <br><br><b>-Dr.[REDACTED]: </b>How do you know all of this information then? Agent[ <br><br><b>REDACTED]: </b>Well uh… let's just say that… uh.. some people may have gotten drunk one night and decided they wanted to play a prank on him involving burying live moles underneath his home for laughs.. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After confirming with local news stations whether or not these events occurred within the town prior to any Foundation involvement within the town itself, several news clips were found confirming such events occurring throughout several homes within the town prior to Foundation intervention as well as interviews between residents claiming they had seen strange creatures burrowing beneath their foundations before disappearing without leaving behind any traces whatsoever leading us into believing that <i>SCP-15249</i> has indeed been living beneath many homes throughout this small town for quite some time now causing us into believing why most residents refused questioning regarding whether or not they had seen anything unusual happening within their homes prior being questioned due them having already known what these creatures actually are due having witnessed them firsthand themselves before reporting them directly towards local police departments who quickly dismissed such claims due lack of evidence leading us into believing why none of these reports ever reached higher authorities before Foundation intervention occurred thus allowing <i>SCP-15249</i> more time than necessary in order for it escape containment once again if left unchecked which could potentially lead into an XK Class End Of The World Scenario if left unchecked which is why we need everyone involved within this operation working together in order capture <i>SCP-15249</i> once again as soon as possible before anyone else finds out about its existence so please keep everything discussed today between yourselves only unless given permission otherwise by myself beforehand thank you very much <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15249.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15249-1:<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15249</i> is placed in a 10m x 10m x 3m containment chamber made of steel.
