Testing with <i>SCP-15632</i> is currently suspended until further notice .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15632</i> is a bag that mummifies people. It was found in Arkansas in 19██.<br><br><i>SCP-15632</i> has the ability to mummify living things by wrapping around them, causing the victim to become completely immobile, and eventually die of suffocation. <i>SCP-15632</i> will also absorb all fluids from the victim's body, leaving only a dried husk behind. This process takes approximately 5 minutes if no liquids are available for absorption at time of contact. If <i>SCP-15632</i> is placed over an open wound it will cause it to close and heal over time as well as absorb any blood present therefrom. The healing process takes approximately 1 hour depending on severity of wound inflicted before application of <i>SCP-15632</i> .<br><br><i>SCP-15632</i> can be removed from its host by cutting or tearing it off with sufficient force; however, this causes all matter absorbed by <i>SCP-15632</i> to be expelled at high velocity towards the nearest living thing within 10 meters (3 meters if said thing is wearing full body armor), regardless of whether or not they were previously affected by <i>SCP-1562</i> . Said expelled matter has been shown to be capable of punching through concrete walls and steel doors with ease when fired at full speed; testing has indicated that this effect also applies if SCP 15632 remains attached but its host dies while still wearing it . The effects described above have been observed even when applied over nonliving objects (e.g., inanimate dummies). Dummies have been observed being shot out at speeds up to ██ km/h after being covered with 156 32 , although most tests showed velocities between ██ km/h and ███ km/h . No dummies have survived these tests thus far due mainly to impact damage caused upon hitting their target(s) ; however , some dummies were able to cause minor damage upon impact due mainly t o their size (i .e., 2x2x0 0 4 cm 3 ) , which was comparable t o that o f a baseball b all when fired from a distance o f 1 0 meters away into reinforced concrete walls at speeds up t o ███km/h (see Addendum #1). It should also be noted that during these tests no abnormal changes were detected in surrounding areas where projectiles landed after bouncing off said walls; i n fact , no changes whatsoever were detected until researchers went down t o check on them later on , which led us t o believe th ere<br><br><h3>Addendum 15632.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████, the first person to be affected by <i>SCP-15632</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with the first human to be affected by <i>SCP-15632</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello, Mr. ██████. How are you feeling? Mr. ███: I'm fine, thank you for asking . Dr .: Let's get started then . Tell me about your experience with <i>SCP-15632</i>, please . Mr.: Well , I was in my house when this bag came flying through my window and wrapped around me like a snake or something! I couldn't move at all! It was horrible ! Then it started absorbing everything around me; it even absorbed the air out of my lungs! I thought that was it for me until someone found me and cut off the bag from my body before anything else could happen… Dr.: Thank you for your time , Mr. [REDACTED]. You may go now . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>This interview confirms our suspicions that removing <i>SCP-15632</i> from a host before said host dies causes its effects to occur regardless of whether or not said host is alive or dead at time of removal; however, further testing on this matter has been suspended until further notice due mainly to ethical concerns regarding possible damage caused by expelled projectiles towards nearby personnel and other research subjects (see Addendum #1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15632.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15632-1: </b>Dummy-15632-A was placed in a standard containment chamber. <i>SCP-15632</i> was then placed over it, and the chamber locked. After 5 minutes, Dummy-15632-A had been completely mummified by <i>SCP-15632</i>. Dummy A was then removed from the chamber and shot out at high speed towards a wall of reinforced concrete at a distance of 10 meters away . The dummy pierced through the concrete with ease , leaving a hole approximately 0 .3 meters in diameter .<br><br>Experiment 15632 -2: Same as Experiment 1, but this time using an unarmored target (Dummy B). After 5 minutes , Dummy B had been completely mummified by SCP - 156 32 . It is worth noting that during this test no projectiles were fired out of the hole created by Experiment 1; however , after 15 minutes o f observation it became clear that projectiles would be fired regardless o f whether or not they were present when testing began (see Addendum #2).<br></div>
