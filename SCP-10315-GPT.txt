How did you come across it? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>I bought it from a man in an alleyway for $10, he said that he had found it somewhere and wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible so he could go home and sleep or something like that, so I bought it off him because I thought that a hammer made of wood would be pretty cool! Dr.: And what happened after you bought the object? Mr.: Well after buying the object off him I went home and put my new hammer on my shelf along with all my other tools , but then when I woke up in the morning there was this note saying <i>"I'm sorry"</i> on my bedside table! So then I took down all my tools from their place on the shelf and saw that they were now made out of pea soup! So then after realising what had happened to them i got really angry at whoever had done this so i grabbed a knife from one of my drawers (which was also made out of wood) and threw at them but missed because they were too far away , but luckily when i looked closer at where i threw the knife there wasn't any pea soup on where i threw it which meant that whoever wrote me that note hadn't gotten hit by it! Then later on when i looked outside there was no one outside which meant they must have gone back into their house or something like that so then while looking around outside for anyone suspicious who might have written me that note ,i found this hammer lying in an alleyway next door to mine which is weird because if someone lost something why wouldn't they just leave it at their house instead of taking time out to leave them somewhere else? But anyways since no one claimed ownership over this hammer(which is strange since if someone lost something why wouldn't they just leave them somewhere else?)I decided to take ownership over them both(the hammer & knives)and keep them with me until someone comes forward claiming ownership over these objects <br><br><b>.Dr.: </b>Thank you very much for your cooperation during our research into <i>SCP-10315</i> . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further testing we discovered more information about <i>SCP-10315</i>'s anomalous effects such as how long does its effect last before wearing off (approximately 24 hours), how long does its effect last before wearing off (approximately 24 hours), how many objects can be turned into pea soup using only one instance (1), and how many instances are needed before turning anything into pea soup using only one instance (5).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10315.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test #: 10315-1<br><br><b>Objective: </b>Test the effects of <i>SCP-10315</i> on non-wooden objects.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A sheet of paper was placed on a table, and <i>SCP-10315</i> was used to hit the paper. The resulting pea soup was collected for analysis.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The paper turned into pea soup when struck by <i>SCP-10315</i>, as expected. Analysis revealed that the paper contained wood pulp.<br><br>Test #: 10315-2<br><br><b>Objective: </b>Test the effects of sunlight on <i>SCP-10315</i>'s effect on living organisms and wooden objects being wielded by living organisms. D Class personnel were instructed to wield <i>SCP-10315</i> while standing in front of a light source. In addition, an object made entirely out of wood (SCP-[REDACTED]) was placed within reach of D Class personnel wielding <i>SCP-10315</i> during this test so that they could use it if needed for protection from sunlight exposure or attack from other sources while wielding it outside their cell at night in case they were unable to return it before sunrise due to its effect not working properly during testing . This test will also be used to determine if there is any limit to how many times an object can be turned into pea soup with one instance of exposure from sunlight . If so, this will help determine what limits this has . If there is no limit , then testing with other materials made entirely out of wood may be required . (See Addendum 10314)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D Class personnel were instructed not touch anything except for the object made entirely out of wood until after sunrise , and then only if no other source is available for them to use instead (such as another hammer). They are told they may not use any part(s) or all parts combined from multiple instances (including non wooden parts )of any item(s) made completely out of wood at once unless otherwise instructed by researchers conducting testing during experiment log below using more than one instance at once provided said item(s) are found within reach/possession/control/command/etc etc etc etc… After sunrise , they are told that they can begin using whatever items they have access too without restriction until sunset comes again . At sunset, all instances must be returned immediately regardless if tests have been completed or not unless otherwise instructed by researchers conducting testing during experiment log below using more than one instance at once provided said item(s) are found within reach/possession/control/command/etc etc etc etc… After sunset has passed and before sunrise comes again , D Class personnel must return all instances immediately regardless if tests have been completed or not unless otherwise instructed by researchers conducting testing during experiment log below using more than one instance at once provided said item(s) are found within reach/possession/control command control control command control … During experimentation involving multiple instances where each individual instance has already been exposed separately prior but each time only partially rather than fully like in previous logs above where each individual instance had never been exposed fully prior but each time only partially rather than fully like in previous logs above where each individual instance had never been exposed fully prior but each time only partially rather than fully like in previous logs above where each individual instance had never been exposed completely previously nor ever since nor ever since nor ever since nor ever since nor even now … Researchers should note which specific portions get used up first when multiple instances get combined together such as head vs handle vs shaft vs blade vs edge vs backside side side side side … Note which specific portions get used up first when multiple instances get combined together such as head vs handle vs shaft versus blade versus edge versus backside side side side sideside sideside sideside sideside sideside … Note which specific portions get used up first when multiple instances get combined together such as head versus handle versus shaft versus blade versus edge against backside against tip against point against end end endendendendendend… Note which specific portions get used up first when multiple instances get combined together such same way over over over over over over repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeated times times times times countless countless countless uncountable uncountable uncount able uncount able un count able un countle ss un countle ss un countle ss unti ls unti ls unti ll s unti ll s unti lll s until until until till l l l llllllllll llllllls till lssssss</div>
