Mrs. <br><br><b>███████: </b>I don't know much about them at all; he never told me much about his work, and the ones he brought home with him didn't look like anything I'd ever seen before! He said they were just some sort of new art project that his boss wanted him to do for a show or something like that, but I'm not sure… He did seem really excited about it though! [Mrs.] ███████ is silent for several seconds before continuing in a somber tone of voice. [Mrs.] <br><br><b>███████: </b>…I should've known something was wrong when he didn't come back from the store yesterday… Dr. O'Neil pauses briefly before speaking again in an attempt to change the subject away from this line of questioning, as she believes it might be too upsetting for her to continue with this interview at this time given her current emotional state and lack of knowledge regarding <i>SCP-15256</i>'s effects at the time of its discovery by Foundation personnel (see Addendum 15256-B). Dr. O'<br><br><b>Neil: </b>What do you think your husband did with those turds after he created them? Mrs. ███████ appears visibly distressed by this question, but does not respond verbally; however she does begin crying heavily afterward and becomes unresponsive until approximately thirty seconds later when she begins speaking again in a quiet voice while wiping tears away from her eyes with one hand while holding a tissue box close to her face with another hand (see attached photograph). [Mrs.] ███████ is silent for several seconds before continuing in a somber tone of voice similar to how she had previously spoken during this interview prior to being interrupted by Drs. O'Neil and Smith earlier today (see Addendum 15256-A).
