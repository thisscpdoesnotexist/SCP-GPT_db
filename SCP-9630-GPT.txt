The box depicts several dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period. These dinosaurs are very much alive and have manifested as a result of <i>SCP-9630</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br>Each dinosaur manifests in a different way each time <i>SCP-9630</i> is opened and closed. At times these manifestations can be experienced directly by human beings, other times they can only be seen on film or video recordings (see document 9630b for details).<br><br><i>SCP-9630</i> was discovered when an 8 year old boy named Jacob ███████ accidentally poured milk onto his cereal one morning. He did not notice any change at first but upon further inspection he noticed that the cereal was soggy and had no artificial flavoring at all (See Addendum 1). Jacob then threw out his bowl of cereal without hesitation, unaware that this would cause the manifestation to occur in the nearby park where he often played with his friends (See Addendum 2). The child was later questioned regarding how he knew not to eat the cereal itself but it is still unclear whether or not something did happen or if this is just another manifestation event (See document 96301 for details).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9630</i> was first discovered after the parents of Jacob ███████ called the police and reported their son missing. Police officers searched nearby parks for several hours before spotting what appeared to be a small, green dinosaur in an open field within ██████ Park. They quickly notified nearby Foundation agents who then took <i>SCP-9630</i> into custody (See Addendum 3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9630.1 :</h3> Recovered Materials<br><br>The following note was found attached to the inside of <i>SCP-9630</i>'s box.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9630.2 :</h3> Recovered Footage<br><br>The following video was recorded by Mobile Task Force Mu-4 (<i>"Debuggers"</i>) during a routine sweep of the local area after <i>SCP-9630</i> was taken into Foundation custody. The dinosaur is believed to be a juvenile Anchiornis huxleyi .</div>
