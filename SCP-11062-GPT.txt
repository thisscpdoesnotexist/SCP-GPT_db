Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b><i>SCP-11062</i>: </b>Will Smith . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Why do you believe that you are  Hollywood actor Will Smith? <br><br><b><i>SCP-11062</i>: </b>Because I am him!

After a period of time has passed, the subject is to be told that the previous statement was false and that his wife is in fact alive. The subject's response will then be recorded. Subject was informed of the death of his wife at 0832 hours on ██/██/████ and remained inconsolable for approximately 3 hours after this information was revealed to him. At 1147 hours, subject was informed that his wife had been revived by Foundation personnel and was currently being treated in an undisclosed location. This information seemed to cheer <i>SCP-11062</i> up slightly, but he still seemed upset about her <i>"death"</i>. Subject asked if he could see her after she recovered from her injuries and expressed a desire to hug her when he did so .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It seems as though <i>SCP-11062</i> does not actually care about the death of his wife, but rather cares about the fact that she died . The reason for this is unclear at this time.<br><br>Experiment 11062 -2:</div>
