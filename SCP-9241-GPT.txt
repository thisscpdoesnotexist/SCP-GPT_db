When attached, they give <i>SCP-9241</i> flight and super strength, but when detached they act as ordinary gauntlets.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9241</i> was found in a small village in [DATA EXPUNGED] that had been taken over by some sort of foreign entity. All the buildings had been turned into large, white cubes with a strange symbol on them. The citizens were all gathered together and slowly being drained of blood and converted into more of these buildings.<br><br>When questioned about his capture, <i>SCP-9241</i> stated he was conducting an investigation about the disappearance of residents from this village (Foundation records show that there has been no unusual disappearances from this village) when he was suddenly attacked by hundreds of these cubes with eyes popping out. He then fell unconscious for two days before waking up inside one of these buildings where he waited for help to arrive until someone did so and brought him back to our facility.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9241.1 :</h3> Discovery of <i>SCP-9241</i>'s gauntlets.<br><br>When <i>SCP-9241</i> was brought back to the facility, he began researching his home dimension (Foundation records show no known dimension with a place called [DATA EXPUNGED]) and found that this village was in fact located in another dimension. However, due to the fact that we have no way of traveling to or entering this dimension, it is impossible to find out where exactly it is located.<br><br><i>SCP-9241</i> has been working on finding a way into his home dimension, but none of his ideas have worked so far.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9241.2 :</h3> Incident of <i>SCP-9241</i>'s gauntlets being stolen.<br><br><i>SCP-9241</i> was out of his containment chamber when a janitor stole the gauntlets from him and took them to the break room. When <i>SCP-9241</i> noticed that his gauntlets were missing, he immediately informed one of our security guards about this matter. The guard then found the janitor in the break room and brought him to one of our interrogation rooms where he was questioned about why he stole <i>SCP-9241</i>'s gauntlets. He said that it was just for fun, but when asked why they are fun to steal, he could not give an answer. The guard then confiscated the object and returned it back to its rightful owner, who placed them on his wrists without incident (See Addendum 9241.3).</div>
