Further research is needed into this matter -Dr. ███<br><br><h3>Addendum 16882.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 16882-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-66892<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-66892 is to type in the password, and then put in a prompt. The prompt must be one word. After putting in the prompt, D-66892 is to press enter. After that, a SCP will appear on the screen. The SCP will appear at Site 19, inside of a containment chamber that has not been used before. The SCP will be contained by the Foundation for 1 month before it is released into the wild and killed by MTF Epsilon-11 (<i>"Nine Tailed Fox"</i>). A report of this experiment can be found here .<br><br><b>Results: </b>A new scp appeared at Site 19, with no name given to it yet. It was contained for 1 month before being released into the wild and killed by MTF Epsilon-11 (<i>"Nine Tailed Fox"</i>). No anomalous properties were detected from it during containment or after its release into the wild until its death at which point an explosion occurred that destroyed all nearby electronics within 100 meters of where it died.<br><br><b>Notes: </b>I wonder what happens if you put in two prompts? -Dr. ██████ Experiment 16882-2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Drs ████ and █████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Two prompts are inputted into SCP 16882's website simultaneously <br><br><b>Results: </b>Two SCPs appeared inside of their own chambers within Site 19 <br><br><b>Notes: </b>That was unexpected -Dr █████ Experiment 16882 -3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Drs ████ & █████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One input prompt was made using two words instead of one <br><br><b>Results: </b>A single scp appeared with multiple anomalies attached to itself <br><br><b>Notes: </b>This could have potential for use as an alternative method for creating new SCPs -Dr █████ Experiment 16882 -4 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D – 66 892 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One word prompt was entered followed by another word Prompt 2 (Prompt 2 does not have any special significance) <br><br><b>Results: </b>An object resembling an apple appeared on site 19 inside a standard containment chamber . Object had no anomalous properties but did taste like apples when tested . Object was disposed off as normal waste after testing . Notes ; Well , we got something different this time around , but still nothing too useful – Dr . Karryn</div>
