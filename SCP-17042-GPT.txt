<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-17042</i> is  a MIDI file that turns anyone who listens to it inside out.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17042</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17042</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times and only accessed with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any personnel who wish to access <i>SCP-17042</i> must first undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure they are not at risk of being affected by its effects.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-17042</i> needs to be tested, it must be done in a soundproof chamber with no living creatures present. All testing must take place under direct observation from two (2) Level 4 personnel and any results obtained must be reported immediately afterwards.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17042</i> is a MIDI file of unknown origin, stored on a standard USB drive. When played back through any electronic device capable of playing music, <i>SCP-17042</i> will cause any human within hearing range to be turned inside out. This effect appears to be instantaneous and permanent, with no known method of reversing it.<br><br>Once the process has been completed, the affected person's body will appear as if it has been inverted; their internal organs are exposed and their skin is now on the outside. The subject's consciousness remains intact however they become unable to speak or move due to the damage done by this process. Subjects have reported that they can still feel sensations such as pain but are otherwise paralyzed until death eventually occurs from organ failure or other complications caused by this transformation.<br><br>Testing has shown that any living creature within hearing range of <i>SCP-17042</i> when it is played will suffer the same effects regardless of species or size; even plants have been observed turning inside out after exposure to <i>SCP-17042</i>. It should also be noted that while playing back <i>SCP-17042</i> does not cause physical harm in itself, anyone who hears it will most likely succumb to its effects unless proper containment protocols are followed immediately afterwards.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17042.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of researchers attempted to reverse the effects of <i>SCP-17042</i> by playing it in reverse. This did not result in any change to the affected individuals and only caused further distress due to their inability to move or speak. As such, this method is not recommended for use.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17042.2 : </h3>Interview with <br>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Interviewee: </b><i>SCP-17042</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 17042.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-741, D-902, D-845<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were instructed to enter a soundproof chamber and listen to <i>SCP-17042</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>All three subjects were immediately turned inside out upon exposure. Subject D-741 expired shortly afterwards due to organ failure while the other two remained conscious but paralyzed until termination.</div>
