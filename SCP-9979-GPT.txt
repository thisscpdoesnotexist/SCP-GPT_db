It is believed that this guilt originates from an incident involving you and your mother during childhood.<br><br><i>SCP-9979</i> was first discovered after a series of reports were filed by Foundation personnel who had been on assignment with their mothers. The reports detailed feelings of intense guilt, which quickly escalated to feelings of self-loathing and suicidal ideation . After several incidents, it was determined that these feelings originated from <i>SCP-9979</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9979.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9979</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted to determine the origin of <i>SCP-9979</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, <i>SCP-9979</i>. I'm here to ask you a few questions about your anomaly, if that's okay with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9979</i>: </b>Sure thing, Doc! What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Well… where did this anomaly originate from? You see, we've had multiple reports of our personnel feeling intense guilt after spending time with their mothers… and it seems like it might have something to do with you… <i>SCP-9979</i> laughs uncomfortably for several seconds before responding. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9979</i>: </b>Oh man… I guess that makes sense now that I think about it… It all started when we were kids, me and my mom lived in this crappy apartment complex on the edge of town . One day my mom asked me if I wanted some cookies she had baked for me – they were these chocolate chip ones she made every week because they were my favorite – and so I said yes , but then she told me that I couldn't have any because we didn't have enough money left over at the end of the month for them . So then she started crying really hard , which made me feel really bad , so instead of eating them myself , I decided to sell them at school . But then when no one would buy them from me because they thought they tasted weird or whatever, a bunch of kids started making fun of her too … And so then later on when we got home from school , there was a note taped on our door saying <i>"You're not good enough"</i> or something along those lines . And after reading it my mom just completely lost it . She broke down crying again and locked herself in her room for days until eventually someone called social services and took us away from each other forever … <<i>SCP-999798</i> pauses briefly before continuing> So yeah … That's pretty much how this whole thing got started actually . Dr. █████ pauses briefly before responding. Dr.: Okay… thank you very much for your time today! We'll be sure to keep an eye out for your mother during your next visit here! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing security footage taken during his previous interview sessions with Foundation personnel prior to containment (see Addendum 9979a), [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 9979.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 9979-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9979, male, age 25.
