    <center> <h3> SCP-25692 is  an anomalous phenomenon that occurs when you kiss your own elbow </h3> </center>
    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-25692</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25692 is an anomalous phenomenon that manifests when a human subject successfully kisses their own elbow. Under normal circumstances, this task is exceedingly difficult due to human arm structure and flexibility constraints; however, if achieved through any means, intentional or otherwise, SCP-25692 initiates a series of reality-altering events.</p>
<p>Upon activation of SCP-25692, the individual - henceforth designated as SCP-25692-1 - experiences an immediate localized reversal of time for the duration of the physical elbow contact. Notably, this temporal effect extends to a radius of approximately 5 meters centered on SCP-25692-1, affecting all objects and living organisms within that range. The length of the temporal inversion correlates with the duration of the elbow kiss.</p>
<p>Once the contact with the elbow ceases, a secondary phase begins, characterized by the generation of a localized spatial distortion. This distortion typically manifests as a wormhole-like aperture leading to random locations, which so far have included alternate realities, distant galaxies, and extra-dimensional spaces. These apertures remain open for indeterminate lengths of time and pose a significant containment breach risk.</p>
<p>The existence of SCP-25692 imposes a severe challenge for the SCP Foundation due to the simplicity of the trigger action and the profound implications of its effects, including potential catastrophic timeline alterations and breaches of the space-time continuum.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Given the inherent difficulty in preemptively preventing SCP-25692 activation events, the primary containment strategy focuses on public misinformation campaigns to reinforce the belief that kissing one's own elbow is impossible and, when attempted humorously, inconsequential.</p>
<p>The Foundation actively monitors social media, medical records, and physiotherapy sessions for any indications of individuals capable of performing the trigger action. Memetic agents are employed within digital media to dissuade the public from even attempting the act.</p>
<p>In the event of an SCP-25692 activation, Mobile Task Force Lambda-4 ("Elbow Grease") is to be immediately deployed to the location to manage the containment of SCP-25692-1 and neutralize any resulting phenomena. This includes the controlled collapse of any spatial distortions and the administration of amnestics to witnesses.</p>
<p>Foundation researchers in the fields of temporal mechanics and spatial anomalies are to continuously study SCP-25692 for potential containment advancements. Any personnel known to possess hypermobility or contortionist skills are to be closely monitored and, if necessary, restricted from performing any actions that could potentially result in elbow kissing.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Report 25692-A</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, an SCP-25692 activation event occurred at a circus performance in ███████, Russia. A contortionist, previously unidentified as a potential SCP-25692-1, publicly kissed their own elbow during an act. The resultant spatial distortion led to the disappearance of the contortionist and three spectators before the aperture spontaneously closed. MTF Lambda-4 contained the situation, and Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. The circus was shut down indefinitely under the guise of structural instabilities detected in the tent.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log 25692-E</h3>
<p>Experiment 25692-E-01</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: To observe the effects of SCP-25692 activation within a controlled environment</li>
<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: D-8432, a D-class personnel with naturally hypermobile joints, was instructed to kiss their elbow within a sealed containment chamber.</li>
<li><strong>Results</strong>: D-8432 successfully initiated SCP-25692. Time reversed for 4.2 seconds within the chamber, followed by the opening of a spatial aperture. D-8432 was lost to the aperture despite retrieval efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Notes</strong>: Experiment confirms SCP-25692's ability to manifest in isolation and hints at the aperture's potential for one-way travel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Interview Log 25692-I</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewed</strong>: Dr. Helena Ivankov, lead researcher on SCP-25692</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Agent Mikhail Voronin</p>
<p><strong><Begin Log></strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Voronin</strong>: Dr. Ivankov, tell us about the current understanding of SCP-25692's mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivankov</strong>: The elbow kiss seems to serve as a catalyst for a profound reality shift, one that's deeply intertwined with the individual's perception of their own body. It's as though this otherwise innocuous action triggers an existential paradox, which reality tries to reconcile through temporal distortion and spatial anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Voronin</strong>: And what of the risks?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivankov</strong>: Any entity with the potential to distort time and space at such a fundamental level poses an existential threat, not only to human life but also to the integrity of the universe as we know it. It's imperative we learn how to predict and control these distortions. </p>
<p><strong>Agent Voronin</strong>: Could there be any potential benefits to harnessing SCP-25692?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivankov</strong>: Theoretically, yes. Understanding the fabric of reality better, perhaps even controlled time travel or access to alternate dimensions. But the risks are monumental. We would need to establish much greater control and deeper knowledge before even considering it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Voronin</strong>: Thank you, Dr. Ivankov.</p>
<p><strong><End Log></strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Note</strong>: Researcher Ivankov's team is currently exploring the development of a specialized containment suit designed to inhibit the wearer's ability to kiss their own elbow as a precautionary measure for personnel at risk of unintentionally triggering SCP-25692.</p></div>
