He told me that he had been kidnapped by some people who were going to kill him if he didn't do what they said but then he hung up before telling me anything else! It was horrible! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it has been concluded that calling someone with an unknown number can be dangerous as there is no way of knowing who will answer or what will happen during the call itself unless further testing is allowed for this anomaly under controlled conditions<br><br><h3>Addendum 10000.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Experiment 10000-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-5013, a Caucasian male, aged 20.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to call <i>SCP-10000</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-10000</i> called the mother of D-5013.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b><i>SCP-10000</i> appears to be able to call the mother of anyone who inputs it into their phone.

It is unknown if this effect will stop once the body has been removed from proximity with SCP - 10000 . + Further testing involving subjects attempting suicide is not allowed , due to risk of spreading anomalous effects . - Dr . ████████ Addendum 10 <br><br><b>0003: </b>One researcher has attempted suicide after being informed that he would not be allowed access back into the facility until further notice , despite having no connection or relation with any other person who had previously been exposed to SCP - 10000 . He was found dead outside Site ██ later that day , having cut open his wrists and bled out onto the ground below him before expiring due to blood loss and hypothermia caused by exposure from lying on top of an uncovered sidewalk in freezing temperatures overnight without any winter clothing or protection against the elements while unconsciousness from blood loss (See Incident Report 10 0003 A ). It seems that there are some sort of anomalous effects associated with interaction with this number which may have spread beyond those directly exposed via telephone contact or voice over IP calls made through public networks (See Incident Report 10 0003 B ). All personnel are reminded that they should avoid using public phones or making calls over unsecured VoIP services unless absolutely necessary for work purposes only during off hours and should never do so during work hours even if they feel like they need a break from working on their assigned tasks as doing so may result in them becoming exposed as well as putting others around them at risk if they are overheard discussing sensitive information about anomalies under containment within earshot of civilians outside our facility's walls who could potentially use said information against us for personal gain through extortion attempts or by selling said information off onto rival organizations within our own government such as MTF Omega 7 (<i>"Hammer Down"</i>) which have been known in the past for attempting espionage operations against us under cover while posing as employees working within our organization posing as janitors , cleaning staff members , cafeteria workers etcetera etcetera etcetera when all along they were really just trying find ways infiltrate our facilities security systems and steal classified documents containing details about ongoing research projects we're conducting here at site 19 related specifically but not limited too [REDACTED] which could potentially put all life on earth including themselves at risk if such sensitive data falls into enemy hands especially considering how many lives were lost during incident 10008 where one member managed somehow get past security measures despite being unarmed while carrying nothing but an empty briefcase before entering restricted areas where he proceeded sabotage various systems resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED] causing multiple containment breaches throughout site 19 resulting ultimately leading up too 9 deaths among staff members including 2 senior researchers whom I knew personally prior too incident 10008 ever happening (see attached photos) along with countless others injured some severely enough requiring hospitalization after suffering severe burns covering most parts their bodies ranging anywhere between 1st degree burns up too 3rd degree burns covering most parts their bodies ranging anywhere between 1st degree burns up too 3rd degree burns caused by various fires breaking out throughout site 19 following sabotage incidents occurring simultaneously across multiple wings located throughout site 19 causing numerous containment breaches resulting ultimately leading up too 9 deaths among staff members including 2 senior researchers whom I knew personally prior too incident 10008 ever happening (see attached photos) along with countless others injured some severely enough requiring hospitalization after suffering severe burns covering most parts their bodies ranging anywhere between 1st degree burns up too 3rd degree burns caused by various fires breaking out throughout site 19 following sabotage incidents occurring simultaneously across multiple wings located throughout site 19 causing numerous containment breaches eventually culminating culminating culminating culminating culminated culminated culminating culminated culminated culmin</div>
