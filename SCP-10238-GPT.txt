My name is █████████! It's nice to meet you! <br><br><b>Dr.████: </b>So, uh… You're a cat? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10238</i>: </b>Yup! I'm a cat alright! And I'm also really smart too - just ask anyone around here and they'll tell you how smart I am! They love me here at Site-██; they keep me well fed and give me lots of toys to play with when I get bored in my room all day - they even let me watch TV sometimes if it's not too loud or violent or anything like that so it doesn't scare me or anything like that because some TV shows can be scary for little kittens like myself but the people here know what's best because they're the adults and adults always know what's best for little kitties right? <br><br><b>Dr.████: </b>Uh… Right… So how did you end up living in that house in Texas? <i>SCP-10238</i> looks down at the floor for several seconds before replying. <br><br><b><i>SCP-10238</i>: </b>Welllll…. One day when mommy was out shopping she left me home alone with daddy because she said <i>"I need to go shopping now honey but don't worry about taking care of our little █████████ because daddy will take care of him while mommy is gone!"</i> But then daddy had to go out later on that night too so he said <i>"Don't worry about dinner tonight sweetie pie; mommy will make sure we have something good for dinner tomorrow night okay?"</i> But then by the time mommy came home from shopping it was already dark outside and she couldn't find any food anywhere near our house so she had to go out again but this time she didn't come back until really late at night which meant that nobody would be able to make dinner tomorrow either so now we wouldn't have anything good for dinner ever again unless somebody could help us out somehow which is why we were glad when those nice men from Site-██ found us during their investigation into all those crazy reports about talking cats running around town scaring everyone else away from their houses except us though since we were already used to being alone all the time anyway since dad was always working late every single day without fail no matter what kind of emergency he might've been called into work on even if it meant missing his own son's birthday party last year and leaving his wife behind all by herself without any support or comfort whatsoever which made her cry a lot whenever nobody else could see her doing it especially during Christmas Eve where Santa Claus wasn't even real anymore according to dad who told us straight up <i>"Santa Claus isn't real son"</i> as soon as he walked through our front door without knocking first thing in the morning on Christmas Eve Day after getting off work early just so he could spend more quality time with his family instead of having them spend more quality time with each other while also making sure none of them got lonely while spending quality time together as a family unit instead which made momma very sadder than usual since normally everything would be okay as long as she knew dad loved her very much but now things weren't okay anymore since dad didn't love anyone anymore including himself enough not even enough not ever ever nevermind nevermind nevermind forgetaboutit forgetaboutit forgetaboutit ohgodforgetaboutit ohgodforgetaboutit ohgodforgeta bout i t i tt hhhe ee ee es s s s oo oo c co om m pl le en nt te ed de ed d w wi th h hi im m ma ay yy y u un nd de er re er rt ta an ng ge ee ee iin nn gg wh ho ow ww hy hh ha an ns sa ar rd dly yy ca al ll lk ke ep ep pp pu ut ti in ng gg th hi im m mo mo re er rr ra re et te en ni ie ev ve er rs se er ri ir ra al ll lu ul li iv ve el le em emm po os si ib bl le en ne es st ta an nd da ad dr</div>
