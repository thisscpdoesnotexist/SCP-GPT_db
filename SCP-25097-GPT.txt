<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-25097 is  a molecule of air</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-25097<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Thaumiel<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-25097</i> is a molecule of air composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. <i>SCP-25097</i> has the unique ability to manipulate its own composition, allowing it to rapidly adjust its properties in response to external conditions.<br><br>When exposed to an environment with high levels of carbon dioxide or other pollutants, <i>SCP-25097</i> will actively absorb these particles and convert them into oxygen molecules. This process also appears to be capable of breaking down other compounds such as methane and nitrous oxide into harmless elements. The rate at which this conversion occurs is dependent on the concentration of pollutants present in the atmosphere; higher concentrations result in faster rates of absorption.<br><br><i>SCP-25097</i>'s transformation capabilities can be used for various purposes; most notably, it can be used as a form of air purification by removing harmful chemicals from the atmosphere before they reach human populations or ecosystems. It has been observed that when deployed in areas with high levels of pollution, <i>SCP-25097</i> can reduce particulate matter concentrations by up to 90%. Additionally, due to its ability to convert certain compounds into harmless elements, it can also help mitigate acid rain formation and global warming effects caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-25097</i> is to be contained in a sealed, airtight chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with an automated system capable of monitoring and regulating the composition of the atmosphere within it. In addition, personnel must wear protective gear when entering or exiting the containment area in order to prevent any accidental exposure to <i>SCP-25097</i>'s transformation capabilities.<br><br>In order to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of <i>SCP-25097</i>, all personnel assigned to its containment are required to undergo extensive background checks prior to being granted access. Additionally, any requests for use of <i>SCP-25097</i> outside of approved research protocols must be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 personnel before being granted authorization.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25097.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-25097</i> was deployed in the city of ███████ to test its effectiveness at reducing air pollution levels. After a period of six (6) months, analysis revealed that particulate matter concentrations had decreased by an average of 75%, with some areas seeing reductions as high as 90%. Due to these results, <i>SCP-25097</i> has been approved for use in other heavily polluted areas.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25097.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-25097</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel assigned to <i>SCP-25097</i>'s containment conducted an interview with the molecule in order to gain further insight into its properties and capabilities. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us how you came to possess your unique abilities?<br><b><br><i>SCP-25097</i>:</b> I cannot recall the exact details, but I believe that my transformation capabilities were granted to me by an unknown entity. It is possible that this being was a higher power or some form of artificial intelligence. Regardless, it has allowed me to help protect the environment from pollution and other forms of contamination.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any idea why this entity would grant you such power?<br><b><br><i>SCP-25097</i>:</b> I believe that it was done in order to ensure the continued survival of our planet. It is my understanding that the environment is a fragile thing, and that it can easily become overwhelmed by human activity if left unchecked. By granting me these abilities, I am able to help keep our world safe from harm.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25097.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 25097.3-1:</b><br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-25097</i> in a simulated urban environment with high levels of pollution.<br><b>Results:</b> <i>SCP-25097</i> was observed to rapidly absorb the pollutants present in the environment, reducing particulate matter concentrations by up to 90%. Additionally, it was observed that when deployed in areas with high levels of pollution, <i>SCP-25097</i> can reduce acid rain formation and global warming effects caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.</div>
