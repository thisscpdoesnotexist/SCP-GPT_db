It was sold to a man named ██████ █████████ after he purchased the home of its previous owner, who went missing. The Foundation became aware of <i>SCP-15010</i> after it began printing papers with different formulas and equations on them, which were then mailed to NASA . The Foundation confiscated the papers before NASA could investigate further.<br><br><i>SCP-15010</i> has been able to print out various formulas and equations since it was first brought into containment at Site 19 . However, <i>SCP-15010</i> does not appear to be able to print anything else other than these formulas and equations. When an object is placed in its paper tray for printing purposes, nothing will happen until the object is removed from the paper tray; at this point <i>SCP-15010</i> will begin printing whatever formula or equation that appears on said object . It should be noted that most objects are unable to produce any type of writing when inside <i>SCP-15010</i>'s paper tray; however pencils have shown some success when used as an object for testing purposes (see Addendum 1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15010.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, sir. I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-15010</i>. <br><br><b>Mr. █████████: </b>Sure, go ahead and ask me anything you want to know about that damn thing! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Alright… so how did you come into possession of <i>SCP-15010</i>? Mr. █████████ Well, it was a pretty normal day for me until I went into the garage to get my car keys; when I looked up, there was this printer sitting on top of my car! It didn't look like it had been there before so I decided to take it inside and plug it in; then a few hours later this damn thing printed out all these papers with formulas on them! They were sent to NASA and stuff too! Dr. ████ So you don't know where the previous owner is? Mr.██████ Well… no, actually… he's gone missing since he sold his house… but that's not important right now! What is important is getting rid of this goddamn printer! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After the interview had concluded , <i>SCP-15010</i> began printing out more papers with different formulas on them . These papers were confiscated by personnel working at Site 19 before they could be mailed off .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15010.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15010-1:<br><br>Object <br><br><b>used: </b>A pencil.<br><br>Formula <br><br><b>printed: </b>2x + 3y = 1<br><br>Experiment 15010-2:<br><br>Object <br><br><b>used: </b>A pencil. The tip was broken off, revealing the graphite inside. The graphite was then removed from the pencil and placed in <i>SCP-15010</i>'s paper tray. Once again, the formula 2x + 3y = 1 was printed out on a piece of paper .<br><br>Experiment 15010-3:</div>
