<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18128 is  The force of five billion headaches</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18128<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18128</i> is a phenomenon that causes individuals to experience a force of five billion headaches simultaneously. This force can be felt throughout the entire body and has been described as an intense pressure, akin to being crushed by an immense weight.<br><br>The source of <i>SCP-18128</i> is unknown, but it appears to originate from a single point in space-time located within Earth's atmosphere. The exact location is unknown and attempts at tracking its origin have failed due to interference from other sources.<br><br><i>SCP-18128</i> affects all living organisms within its range, regardless of species or size. Affected subjects experience extreme pain and discomfort which increases with proximity to the source, eventually leading to unconsciousness or death if left untreated for too long. In addition, those affected by <i>SCP-18128</i> are unable to move away from the source on their own volition; any attempt made will result in further pain and discomfort until they are forced back into range of the phenomenon's effects.<br><br>The only known way of mitigating <i>SCP-18128</i>'s effects is through use of specially designed shielding devices developed by Foundation personnel using anomalous materials recovered from [REDACTED]. These devices emit a field that reduces the intensity of <i>SCP-18128</i>'s effects on those within its range, allowing them time needed for evacuation before more severe symptoms set in.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-18128</i>, containment is impossible. As such, Foundation personnel have been instructed to monitor its activity and deploy shielding devices whenever necessary in order to protect civilians from its effects.<br><br>In addition, research efforts are ongoing in an attempt to identify the source of <i>SCP-18128</i> and develop a permanent solution for containing it. All personnel assigned to this task are required to wear protective gear at all times while conducting their investigations.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18128.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a large-scale containment breach of <i>SCP-18128</i> occurred in [REDACTED]. Despite the deployment of multiple shielding devices, casualties were reported to be in the thousands. The source of this breach is unknown and investigations are ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18128.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> So what can you tell me about this phenomenon?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> We know that it originates from a single point in space-time, but we haven't been able to pinpoint its exact location yet. We believe it's located somewhere within Earth's atmosphere, though the exact coordinates remain unknown. As for what causes it, we're still trying to figure that out as well.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Is there any way to stop it?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> We've developed shielding devices that can mitigate its effects, but they're not a permanent solution. We're still researching ways to contain <i>SCP-18128</i> and find a more permanent solution.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18128.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel (Designation: D-18128)<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to approach the source of <i>SCP-18128</i> and remain within its range for as long as possible.<br><b>Result:</b> Subject reported feeling an intense pressure on their body, followed by a sensation of being crushed from all directions. After approximately one minute, subject began to exhibit signs of severe pain and unconsciousness before being removed from the area by Foundation personnel.</div>
