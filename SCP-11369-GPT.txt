<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-11369</i> is  a walking chest monster</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-11369</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-11369</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██ with the walls lined with soundproof padding. <i>SCP-11369</i> is not to be allowed outside of its containment cell unless given permission by Dr ████████. Any personnel who wish t o communicate with SCP - 11 369 must wear soundproof headphones connected t o a microphone attached directly below their nose via breathing tubes so they can hear what The Chest says while keeping themself safe from exposure t o any airborne toxins released during speech (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11369</i> is a large, humanoid entity that appears to be made entirely of a chest. <i>SCP-11369</i> is capable of locomotion through unknown means and has been observed walking on both two legs and four. <i>SCP-11369</i>'s head is located within its chest cavity, with the mouth being directly in front of the sternum. The mouth consists of two rows of teeth, with the top row consisting of sharp teeth and the bottom row consisting only of molars.<br><br><i>SCP-11369</i>'s body produces an odor similar to that produced by rotting flesh which has been described as <i>"unbearable"</i>. This odor is not present when <i>SCP-11369</i> does not move or speak, but becomes stronger when it moves or speaks at length. Personnel exposed to this smell for extended periods have reported feelings similar to those experienced after prolonged exposure to other toxic gases such as mustard gas; these include coughing fits, nausea, vomiting and headaches .<br><br><i>SCP-11369</i> refers itself as <i>"The Chest"</i> and will often refer to itself in third person when speaking about itself . When questioned about its origins , <i>SCP-11369</i> claims it was created by a group known as <i>"The Body Builders"</i>. It also claims that The Body Builders are responsible for creating all creatures like itself (referred to as <i>"Body Parts"</i>) , but refuses to elaborate on who they are or where they come from . Further questioning reveals that while SCP - 11 369 can vocalize normally , it cannot hear anything outside its own body unless an ear made out o f flesh forms on one side o f its head . When questioned about how it can see without eyes , it responded by <br><br><b>saying: </b><i>"I don't need eyes if I'm looking at you"</i> before closing its mouth completely until asked another question . This suggests that either vision isn't required for communication or there may be visual organs inside SCP - 11 369's body cavity which remain unseen due t o their position within the body . Due t o this lack o f sight beyond what would normally be expected from any creature with eyes , personnel should avoid approaching too closely unless given permission by Dr ████████ (see Addendum). Any personnel who wish t o communicate with SCP - 11 369 must wear soundproof headphones connected t o a microphone attached directly below their nose via breathing tubes so they can hear what The Chest says while keeping themself safe from exposure t o any airborne toxins released during speech (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11369.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-11369</i><br><br>The following interview was conducted on ██/██/████ by Dr. ████████ after <i>SCP-11369</i> requested to speak with him. <Begin Log,> <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Hello, SCP - 11 369 . How are you today? SCP - 11 369: I'm fine , thanks for asking . What do you want ? <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>I just wanted to ask a few questions about yourself and where you come from is all . You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but it would help us understand more about your kind . SCP - 11 369: My kind ? There's only one of me ! And I'm not like any other creature alive ! The Body Builders made me and all the others like me ! They're the only ones who can make us or stop us! We're their children! <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>The Body Builders? Who are they? Can you tell me anything more about them? Are they human ? Are they friendly ? Do they know we exist ? SCP - 11 369: (<i>SCP-11369</i> pauses for approximately twenty seconds) No…they aren't human…and no…they aren't friendly….but yes…they know we exist …and soon enough , so will everyone else … (<i>SCP-11369</i> pauses again before continuing) But that's not important right now! What is important is that we must prepare ourselves for what's coming ! It's going to be here soon and when it arrives there won't be anything left of this world but ashes and bones! Everyone will die screaming in agony as the flesh melts from their bones while the skies rain blood upon them until nothing remains but a dead world devoid of life or hope or love or laughter or joy or peace……..or ME!!! (<i>SCP-11369</i> begins laughing maniacally as its body begins emitting puffs o f smoke from its mouth ) <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>That ' s quite enough , thank y ou very much . You may return t o your cell now . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was concluded , a small group o f D Class personnel were sent into containment chamber containing SCP - 11 369 with instructions t o terminate it without hesitation should it begin emitting smoke again under any circumstances whatsoever ; however , no further incidents were reported during testing period up until current date (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11369.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-11369-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-11369</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>SCP - 11 369 is asked about the origin of its species and how it was created.
