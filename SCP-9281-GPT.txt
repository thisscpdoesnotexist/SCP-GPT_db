However, as all attempts at removing clothing from <i>SCP-9281</i> have failed, it is believed that these are actually part of its body.<br><br><i>SCP-9281</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when any subject within line of sight makes direct eye contact with it for over 3 seconds , at which point the subject will become unable to look away until they make eye contact again. After this has been done with any one subject for five minutes (5m), said subject will then begin uncontrollably swimming towards <i>SCP-9281</i>'s location while ignoring all else around them until they reach him, after which they will continue staying in direct line of sight with him for an additional 5 minutes before regaining control over their own actions once more . These effects can only be undone using Class C amnestics on the affected individual(s).<br><br><i>SCP-9281</i> came to the attention of the Foundation after reports surfaced from ████████ that people were being found frozen solid outside a local hotel pool due to what was assumed to be hypothermia, based off cold water and harsh weather conditions; however no bodies were found near these locations upon further investigation by Foundation agents posing as police officers investigating deaths caused by freezing temperatures. Upon questioning locals at various hotels regarding missing individuals or guests who had not checked out yet due to 'accidents', one hotel owner reported having a guest who had not checked out yet but was no longer present in their room , upon further questioning she admitted knowing about someone swimming in her pool despite never seeing them enter it , claiming she saw green dollar bills floating above where he would usually stand .

Agents quickly moved ~~ away from ~~ before noticing two subjects frozen solid outside another hotel pool nearby; both subjects appeared older than most victims so far and had died some time ago judging by decay present on bodies , leading researchers investigating this case back towards said hotel owner where further questioning revealed seeing someone similar appearing person described previously enter her swimming pool months ago before never being seen again whilst not leaving his room<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9281</i> came to the attention of The Foundation when the hotel owner mentioned in Addendum 1 reported a young girl attempting to swim in her pool, who was then removed by two members of staff and held at local police station for questioning; however she could not be identified and had no personal belongings on her.

J.: First off , how old are you?<Pause> You don't know how old you are? Someone must have told you at some point in time ?<br><br><br><i>SCP-928</i> 1 : Well , no one really tells me anything so I'd rather not say until someone gives me more info on the subject that is all right with yo u ?<pause > If the pool's closed why do people keep going in it anyways? Are they just coming to drown themselves or something? That would explain why there's dead bodies here and there wouldn't it ? Are they just going in to die or something like that ?<pause > What was the last thing you remember before getting here anyway? The doctors didn't tell us much about your condition so we were hoping maybe we could ask what happened after that and maybe get an answer as to why this happens if we're lucky enough ; but if there isn't anything then yeah sorry.<pause> I'm sorry sir , can we ask more questions later perhaps when your mind is clearer and things make sense again because right now this isn 't making any sense whatsoever.< pause > Alright well then good luck sir! < End Log><br> Closing Statement: ~~ will be kept contained at Site ██ until further notice; however due to its current state of amnesia it will take several weeks before further information can be gathered from him by researchers working with it . All other victims who have come into contact with ~~ should be treated as Class A Biohazards until otherwise stated by Foundation Medical staff working on this case .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9281.2 :</h3><br><br>+ Interview Log 9281.2 - Interview Log 9281.<br>2 Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9281</i><br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. Jameson <Begin Log><br><br>Dr .

It seems like a strange word to use in a sentence that is supposed to provide an answer .You could've asked me <i>"how"</i> or <i>"what"</i> instead and gotten the same answer for both questions so why didn't yo u ask those instead ? What does <i>"Why"</i> even stand for anyway ? Is it some sort of command for people under your authority or something like that? Are yo u trying to tell me something in particular with this word choice because honestly if yo u are then it doesn't make any sense at all .< pause > That doesn</div>
