All instances of <i>SCP-15507</i> are to be destroyed, and any persons who have viewed <i>SCP-15507</i> are to be administered Class A amnestics.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15507</i> is an episode of the children's cartoon Spongebob Squarepants. <i>SCP-15507</i> exhibits no anomalous effects when viewed by any person who is not between the ages of 4 and 8 years old. Upon viewing <i>SCP-15507</i>, subjects will experience a compulsion to rewatch <i>SCP-15507</i> until they are between the ages of 4 and 8 years old. Subjects under the age of 4 years old are immune to this effect, but still view <i>SCP-15507</i> as normal for their age group.<br><br><i>SCP-15507</i> was first discovered in ████, USA on █/██/20██ after reports from parents about their children watching it excessively were reported to local law enforcement officials. After confiscating several copies from parents, law enforcement officials contacted Foundation personnel for assistance in determining its nature and origin. After a thorough investigation into possible sources for the anomaly was conducted, it was determined that <i>SCP-15506</i> originated from an unknown source on Earth with a range extending out approximately 100 meters around its point of origin (see Addendum 15506).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15507.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████, creator of <i>SCP-15507</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted on 11/17/20██. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello Mr. ██████, thank you for agreeing to this interview today. I'd like to start by asking you a few questions about the episode <i>"The Bully"</i> and its production in general if that's alright with you? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Sure thing, what do you need to know? Dr. ███: Well first off I'd like to ask how long it took to produce the episode in general? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well I started working on it around November of 2001, so about a year and a half or so give or take a few months here and there depending on my schedule at the time. Why do you ask though? Dr. ███: You were aware that your show was being used by some parents as an educational tool for their children before the Foundation was contacted right? █████ (laughs): Yeah sure I knew that, but what does it have anything to do with anything here? Dr. ███ (pauses): So then why did you write an episode where Patrick Star is teaching Spongebob Squarepants how to bully other kids when he himself is such an infamous bully among his peers? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing video footage from Mr.████████'s home during production of <i>"The Bully"</i>, researchers discovered several instances where he had physically abused his wife and son over small things such as not cleaning up after himself quickly enough or not finishing his food fast enough leading up until the point when she left him which occurred within two months before <i>SCP-15507</i> was produced . Further investigation revealed that he had been abusing both them since they moved into their house in late 1999 , but stopped after she left him due to stress caused by her leaving him taking its toll on him .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15507.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15507-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15507-1, a 5 year old male of European descent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was shown <i>SCP-15507</i> and then interviewed after the viewing. The following is a transcript of the interview.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-15507-1 <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, D-15507, I am going to ask you some questions about the video you just saw. Is that alright? <br><br><b>D-15507-1: </b>Uh huh! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Ok good! Now let's start off with some basic information; what did you think of it? D0 <br><br><b>155071: </b>It was awesome! I liked how they were all like <i>"What are we gonna do?"</i> and then they were like <i>"We'll just have to play with our imagination!"</i> Then they made an imaginary friend out of nowhere and it was super cool! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's great! What else did you think about it? Did anything unusual happen while watching it? D0 <br><br><b>155071: </b>Well… when Spongebob said <i>"I can't believe this"</i> he looked right at me for a second… but that's probably just cause I'm new here or something… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After review by Foundation personnel, this instance was determined to be nonanomalous in nature due to its lack of effect on subjects under 4 years old .
