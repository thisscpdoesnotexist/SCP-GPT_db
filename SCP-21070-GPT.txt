The trucks are painted a bright yellow color with black trimming, and have the words <i>"FlexTrucks"</i> printed on the sides of each truck.<br><br>When any living organism approaches within 5 meters of <i>SCP-21070</i>, their muscles will involuntarily flex as if they were performing an intense workout routine. This effect is not limited to humans; animals that come into contact with <i>SCP-21070</i> also experience this effect. The only way to stop this effect from occurring is to move away from the trucks or be physically restrained by another person or object.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-21070</i> last for approximately 30 minutes after initial exposure before dissipating completely. During this time period, subjects report feeling energized and more alert than usual despite having just completed an intense physical activity session without any prior warning or preparation beforehand. Subjects who remain exposed to <i>SCP-21070</i> for longer than 30 minutes do not experience any further effects beyond what was initially experienced during the first 30 minute period.<br><br>It appears that these effects are caused by a type of energy emitted by both trucks which has been classified as <i>"flex radiation"</i>. Analysis has revealed that this radiation consists mostly of electromagnetic waves which cause muscle contractions when they come into contact with living organisms within 5 meters of either truck's vicinity. It is currently unknown how exactly these waves interact with organic matter in order to produce such results but research is ongoing into discovering a possible explanation for it's anomalous properties .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-21070</i> is to be kept in a secure containment facility at all times. Access to the trucks is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher and must be accompanied by at least two armed guards at all times. Any personnel who come into contact with <i>SCP-21070</i> must undergo a physical examination afterwards in order to ensure that no adverse effects have occurred due to exposure.<br><br>In the event of an emergency, <i>SCP-21070</i> can be transported via airlift using specialized cargo planes which are equipped with shielding capable of blocking out any flex radiation emitted by the trucks during transport.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21070.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, both trucks were moved to a new containment facility in order to facilitate further study into their anomalous properties. During the move, it was discovered that <i>SCP-21070</i> had begun to emit a low humming sound which increased in volume as it approached the new containment facility. This sound has been identified as being similar to that of an engine running at full capacity and is believed to be connected with the flex radiation emitted by <i>SCP-21070</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21070.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ███████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ███████, can you tell us a bit about your experience with <i>SCP-21070</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Well, I was asked to come in and take a look at the trucks when they were first discovered and see if I could make sense of what was going on. When I got there, the trucks were just sitting there in the middle of an empty field with no one else around them. As soon as I stepped within 5 meters of them though, my muscles started flexing involuntarily like someone had turned on some kind of invisible switch inside me! It was really strange but also kind of exhilarating at the same time; it felt like my body was being pushed to its limits without me even having to do anything!<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Interesting. And what did you make of the radiation that was coming from the trucks?<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Well, it's still a bit of a mystery as to how exactly this radiation is able to cause such effects in living organisms but my best guess is that it has something to do with the way electromagnetic waves interact with organic matter. We're still trying to figure out more about it though so hopefully we'll have some answers soon.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21070.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21070-1:</b> On ██/██/████, two D-class personnel were instructed to approach <i>SCP-21070</i> in order to observe the effects of the trucks on human subjects. Upon reaching a distance of 5 meters from either truck, both subjects experienced involuntary muscle flexing and reported feeling energized despite not having performed any physical activity prior to their exposure. After 30 minutes had passed, the effects dissipated and both subjects returned to normal with no adverse side effects noted.</div>
