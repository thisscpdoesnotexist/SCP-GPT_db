I'm here to ask you a few questions about your son's death and the circumstances surrounding it. Mrs. [REDACTED]: Of course, doctor… What do you want to know?<br><br><b> Dr.:</b> First of all, could you tell me how did your son die?<br><br><b> Mrs.:</b> He killed himself… He hung himself in his bedroom with a belt from his closet… I found him when I came home from work that day…<br><br><b> Dr.:</b> Why did he do it? Was there any note left behind or anything like that?<br><br><b> Mrs.:</b> No doctor, there wasn't any note or anything like that… All he left behind was this plushie on his bed next to him… It was so cute! I didn't know my son had such an eye for design!<br><br><b> Dr.:</b> So what happened then? Did he have any problems at school or something like that?<br><br><b> Mrs.:</b> No doctor, not at all! My son was a good boy who never gave me any problems! He got good grades in school and had lots of friends! But now look at him; dead because he couldn't accept who he really is! It's so sad doctor; it really is.. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><b> Closing Statement:</b> After the interview ended we asked Mr., ████'s mother if she would be willing to give us <i>SCP-9697</i> for further testing but she refused saying <i>"it doesn't deserve to be locked up in some cold storage room"</i>. She also told us how much her son loved sharks and how happy he used to be when playing with <i>SCP-9697</i> as a child which led us to believe <i>SCP-9697</i> may have been involved in Mr.'s suicide somehow but we still don't know why exactly it would cause someone kill themselves just by being near them .<br><br><h3><br><br><b>Addendum 9697.2 :</b></h3> Interview<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <b><br><br><b>Interviewed:</b>  <i>SCP-9697</i><br><br></b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer:</b>  Dr. ██████<br><br></b> <br><br><b> Foreword:</b> The following interview was conducted after the death of ██████ ████, the first person to have been affected by <i>SCP-9697</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-9697</i>. I'm here to ask you a few questions about your previous owner'<br><br><b>s death and your own anomalous properties. <i>SCP-9697</i>:</b> Hey there! Nice to meet you!<br><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Now, I want you to be honest with me in this interview, okay? We know that you are used by LGBT teenagers in order to gather the strength they need for their coming out process, so please don't try anything funny during this conversation or we will have no choice but put you back into containment and never let anyone see you again… Do we understand each other?<br><br><b> <i>SCP-9697</i> nods affirmatively. Dr. ██████:</b> Okay then… So tell me about yourself; what do you do exactly? How does it work? What are your limitations? Can someone use more than one of them at once if they're feeling particularly weak on a given day? Can someone use one of them if they're not LGBT themselves but just want some extra strength for something else entirely unrelated? (<i>SCP-9697</i> remains silent)<br><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Hello?! Are you still there?! (<i>SCP-9697</i> remains silent) Dr. ██████ sighs before taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes before putting them back on again and looking at the subject again with an annoyed expression on his face before continuing the interview <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><b> Closing Statement :</b> After being asked several questions regarding its anomalous properties without receiving any answer from it whatsoever, 9697 was left alone in its containment locker while Site personnel were ordered not to interact with it anymore unless absolutely necessary until further notice .</div>
