So me and my friends ate some of the bar but nothing happened except for us feeling really full so we decided to throw out the rest of the bar but before we could do that a guy who worked at the factory came up to us and said he wanted some too so he took one piece of <i>SCP-15379</i> from us and ate it then he started screaming in pain so me and my friends ran away as fast as possible because something was wrong with that thing! After running for a while we stopped because there was no one around anymore except for us, then all of a sudden this chocolate bar appeared out of nowhere in front of us saying <i>"Choco Choco Choco"</i> over and over again until finally disappearing into thin air right before our eyes! We were scared shitless after seeing that so me and my friends ran back home as fast as possible where I told everyone what had happened earlier today… And now here I am talking to you about how fucked up this whole situation is… <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Thank you very much for your time Mr….
