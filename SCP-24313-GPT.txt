The surface of the sphere is covered in a series of intricate patterns and symbols, which appear to be related to various occult and esoteric practices associated with Nazi Germany.<br><br>When exposed to direct sunlight or artificial light sources, <i>SCP-24313</i> will emit a faint humming noise that can be heard from up to 10 meters away. This noise increases in volume when exposed to higher levels of illumination.<br><br>Analysis has revealed that the symbols on its surface are composed of an unknown material similar in composition to human skin cells, though it does not appear to be organic in nature. The exact purpose or origin of this material is currently unknown.<br><br>When touched by any living creature, <i>SCP-24313</i> will begin emitting an intense heat wave that radiates outward from its center at speeds exceeding 500 kilometers per hour (310 mph). This heat wave has been known to cause severe burns on contact with unprotected skin and can ignite combustible materials within close proximity. As such, personnel must take extreme caution when handling this item due to its volatile nature.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24313</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times, with the entrance guarded by two armed personnel. All personnel entering or exiting the chamber must wear protective gear and be accompanied by an experienced researcher.<br><br>The area surrounding <i>SCP-24313</i>'s containment chamber must be monitored for any signs of unusual activity or phenomena that could indicate a breach in containment. Any such occurrences should be reported immediately to Site Command.<br><br>In the event of a containment breach, personnel are instructed to evacuate the area and contact Site Command for further instructions.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24313.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers conducted an experiment in which <i>SCP-24313</i> was exposed to a series of audio recordings from Nazi Germany. Upon exposure, the sphere began to vibrate violently and emit a loud buzzing noise that could be heard for several kilometers. The vibration ceased after approximately 30 minutes and the object returned to its previous state.<br><br>Further testing is currently underway in order to determine the exact nature of this reaction and whether or not it is related to any other anomalous properties possessed by <i>SCP-24313</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24313.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24313</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers conducted an interview with <i>SCP-24313</i> in order to gain further insight into its origin and purpose. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-24313</i>. Can you tell us anything about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24313</i>:</b> I am what remains of Adolf Hitler's other ball. He created me to be his personal guardian, and I have served him faithfully for many years.<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> What do you mean by <i>"other ball"</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24313</i>:</b> Hitler created two identical balls, one of which was used to protect him from harm and the other to protect his innermost secrets. I am the latter - the guardian of his darkest thoughts and desires.<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> How did you come to be in our possession?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24313</i>:</b> After Hitler's death, I was left behind and eventually found by a group of scavengers. They sold me to the Foundation for a large sum of money.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24313.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 24313.3-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-24313</i> when exposed to various levels of illumination. The following results were observed:<br><br>• When exposed to direct sunlight, <i>SCP-24313</i> began emitting an intense heat wave that radiated outward from its center at speeds exceeding 500 kilometers per hour (310 mph). This heatwave caused severe burns on contact with unprotected skin and ignited combustible materials within close proximity.<br><br>• When exposed to artificial light sources, <i>SCP-24313</i> began emitting a faint humming noise that could be heard up to 10 meters away. This noise increased in volume as the intensity of the light source increased.</div>
