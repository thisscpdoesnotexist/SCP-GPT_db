<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27797 is an anomalous phenomenon that manifests as a localized region of fluctuating spacetime, capable of extending infinitely in all directions while simultaneously occupying a confined space. Its appearance is of a perpetually unfolding tesseract-like structure, with an iridescent surface that refracts light in impossible ways. This SCP exhibits controlled higher-dimensional movement and has been observed to expand, contract, and twist in manners that contradict the three spatial dimensions understood by human physics.</p>
<p>SCP-27797's core effect occurs when a conscious entity perceives it directly. Subjects report experiencing multidimensional shifts in perception and cognition. Long-term exposure results in severe psychological alterations, often rendering subjects incapable of integrating with normal three-dimensional environments. Affected individuals have been reclassified as SCP-27797-1. Attempts to record SCP-27797 using two-dimensional and three-dimensional devices result in corrupted data or machinery malfunction.</p>
<p>SCP-27797 was initially discovered in [REDACTED], after numerous reports mentioned a "living fractal" that turned the local area into a "landscape painted by a god gone mad." Following initial containment failure, it was also found to have a connection with SCP-2634, a sentient, adaptive memetic virus that propagates through information about SCP-27797.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to its unpredictable and volatile nature, SCP-27797 is housed in a specially designed containment facility located in [REDACTED]. This facility is fitted with advanced spatial-stabilization technology, although effectiveness remains limited. The containment chamber must be observed via remote quantum sensors, and all data must be filtered through AI-driven algorithms to detect any memetic hazards from SCP-2634.</p>
<p>Personnel assigned to SCP-27797 must undergo comprehensive psychological and cognitive evaluations to ensure they possess no innate susceptibility to higher-dimensional influence. Personnel must avoid direct visual contact with SCP-27797. Any individual affected by SCP-27797 or exhibiting symptoms of SCP-2634 infection must be quarantined immediately and treated with Class VII amnestics. In case of containment breach, Procedure Icarus-Fall must be enacted, which involves the use of temporal anchors to stabilize the immediate environment and prevent reality distortion on a wider scale.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experiment 27797-E-01</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Determine the effects of indirect exposure to SCP-27797 on D-class personnel.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-5534 is instructed to observe SCP-27797 through a remote quantum sensor feed.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> D-5534 reports severe disorientation and headaches within minutes, followed by a perception of "time unfolding." Symptoms persisted 48 hours post-exposure.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Indirect exposure confirmed as harmful. Quantum sensor filters upgraded to mitigate effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment 27797-E-05</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the interaction between a subject affected by SCP-27797 and the uninfected.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-6019 (SCP-27797-1) places in a controlled environment with D-6081.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Within hours, D-6081 exhibits symptoms identical to SCP-27797-1 without direct exposure to the SCP. D-6019 [DATA EXPUNGED] requiring termination of both subjects.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-27797's effect might be transmitted between individuals. Additional research warranted. Reality-stabilization protocols updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment 27797-E-09</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Gauge the possibility of communication with SCP-27797.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> An AI-assisted communication protocol is enacted, using geometric visual signals.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-27797 responds with incomprehensible multidimensional constructs, causing [REDACTED]. The facility sustains significant damage; emergency containment protocols successful.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-27797 maintains a form of sentience or reactive intelligence. Direct interaction strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Incident Report 27797-2634-Ω</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> [REDACTED]</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> A containment breach resulted in SCP-27797 interacting with a digital archive containing exhaustive data on SCP-2634. SCP-27797 exhibited an immediate and violent reaction, expanding exponentially and causing severe reality distortion effects. SCP-2634 infection rates among personnel spiked, resulting in mass hallucinations and data breaches across the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>The breach was eventually contained using Procedure Icarus-Fall. Communication with SCP-27797 was attempted as a last resort, leading to the discovery of a potential means to negotiate with the entity. All data referring to this event are currently classified; access requires O5-level clearance.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this incident, Special Containment Procedures were updated to reflect the interdependency between SCP-27797 and SCP-2634, necessitating the development of additional protocols to handle memetic threats.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: O5 Council Note</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>From:</strong> O5-█</li>
<li><strong>To:</strong> All personnel involved with SCP-27797</li>
</ul>
<p>"The presence of SCP-27797 represents a grave threat to our understanding of reality and our ability to maintain it. Its connection with SCP-2634 only exacerbates this danger. We urge all personnel to adhere strictly to the updated containment procedures and to report any anomalies, however minute, immediately. Remember, the unpredictability of SCP-27797 is not to be underestimated; our very existence may depend upon our vigilance."</p>
