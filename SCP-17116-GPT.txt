<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17116 is  cursed bees!</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17116<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17116</i> is a species of bee, approximately 5mm in length and 1.5mm in width. The bees are black with yellow stripes on their abdomens and have six legs and two antennae.<br><br>When exposed to any human, <i>SCP-17116</i> will immediately begin to swarm around them, attempting to sting the person multiple times before retreating back into its hive. After stinging the subject, they will experience intense pain for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours depending on how many times they were stung. Additionally, after being stung by <i>SCP-17116</i> the subject will be afflicted with an unknown curse that causes them to suffer from extreme misfortune for an indefinite amount of time until it wears off naturally or is removed by magical means.<br><br>The effects of this curse can range from minor inconveniences such as bad luck or small accidents all the way up to life threatening situations like car crashes or natural disasters occurring near the affected individual's location. It should be noted that no matter how severe these effects may be, no permanent physical harm has been observed thus far due to this curse.<br><br>The source of <i>SCP-17116</i> is currently unknown but it appears that they are native to [REDACTED]. They have been known to inhabit areas where humans live in large numbers and appear capable of reproducing quickly when given access too suitable environments such as forests or gardens with plenty of flowers for nectar sources and other insects present for food sources.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17116</i> is to be contained in a standard insect containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be kept at a temperature of 25°C and have an artificial light source that mimics natural sunlight. A single beekeeper is to be assigned to the containment chamber and must wear protective clothing whenever entering or exiting the area.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential outbreaks, all personnel are required to report any sightings of <i>SCP-17116</i> immediately and take appropriate measures for their capture and containment. Additionally, all personnel are prohibited from attempting to interact with <i>SCP-17116</i> in any way as this could potentially lead to them being cursed by the entity.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17116.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to capture and contain <i>SCP-17116</i> in order to study it further. However, after successfully capturing a single specimen they were unable to contain it as the entity managed to escape its containment chamber shortly afterwards. It is currently unknown where this particular specimen has gone or if any other specimens exist outside of Site-██.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17116.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17116</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a single <i>SCP-17116</i> was captured and contained in a standard insect containment chamber at Site-██. It was then interviewed by Dr. ██████ in order to gain more information about the entity. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me why you are attacking humans?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17116</i>:</b> We are protecting our hive from those who would do it harm. We will sting anyone who threatens us or our home and curse them with misfortune until they leave us alone or we are destroyed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17116.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17116.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, a single specimen of <i>SCP-17116</i> was placed in an isolated room with two D-Class personnel. After several minutes of observation, the bee began to swarm around one of the personnel and proceeded to sting them multiple times before retreating back into its hive.<br><br>The affected individual then reported feeling intense pain for a period of time before eventually calming down and reporting that they felt as if something was wrong but could not pinpoint what it was exactly. After several days had passed, the individual began to experience extreme misfortune such as car accidents, losing their job and other misfortunes that seemed directly related to their presence near <i>SCP-17116</i>'s hive. The curse eventually wore off after approximately two weeks without any magical intervention or outside help being required.</div>
