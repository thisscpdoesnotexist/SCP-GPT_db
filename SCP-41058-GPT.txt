<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-41058, colloquially known as "WoodðŸªµ Loggy", is a segment of nondescript, cylindrical hardwood measuring approximately 0.5 meters in length and 0.25 meters in diameter. The exterior surface of SCP-41058 resembles that of a typical cut log, exhibiting annual rings and a rough bark texture. However, SCP-41058 possesses anomalous properties that only manifest when an individual verbally expresses a desire or intention while in direct contact with it.</p>
<p>When SCP-41058's anomalous effect is triggered, it will instantaneously transmute into an item or entity that fulfills the desire or intention expressed by the contact individual (heretofore referred to as the "user"). The transformation is complete within a matter of seconds, and the result can range from mundane objects to living organisms. In instances where the desired outcome is abstract or cannot be materialized in a physical form, SCP-41058 remains inert, and no changes are observed.</p>
<p>The abilities of SCP-41058 seem to be limited by the imagination and specificity of the user's expressed desire, as well as by an as-yet undetermined set of rules governing the conservation of mass and complexity. While SCP-41058 can produce both animate and inanimate objects, it has never been observed to create items with mass significantly greater than its own or items with complex mechanisms or electronics from the 21st century or beyond.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-41058 is to be contained in a standard secure object locker at Site-66. The locker is to be installed with a voice-activated lock that is programmed to respond only to authorized Level-2 personnel and above. To avoid incidental activation of SCP-41058's properties, conversations within the containment chamber should be kept to a minimum, and any mentions of desires or intentions should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Due to SCP-41058's benign nature and relatively simple containment requirements, interaction for research and testing purposes may be approved by the Site Director or a designated research lead. All tests must be documented, and any products generated by SCP-41058 are to be cataloged and, if deemed safe, may be repurposed for use within the Foundation or incinerated if they represent a potential containment risk.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery and Retrieval</h3>
<p>SCP-41058 was discovered in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, a small village in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, after reports of a "miracle log" reached local Foundation operatives. According to eyewitness accounts, local inhabitants had used it in various capacities, including but not limited to creating food, tools, and in one instance, reportedly, a "healing salve" that cured minor cuts and ailments. A covert recovery team was deployed, and SCP-41058 was secured with no resistance from the local population, who seemed relieved to be rid of the anxiety surrounding the unpredictable outcomes of their wishes. A cover story about an art installation theft was disseminated to explain SCP-41058's disappearance.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log 41058</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment 41058-01:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-41392
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to touch SCP-41058 and express a desire for "something to eat."
- <strong>Result:</strong> SCP-41058 transformed into a loaf of sourdough bread. The bread was edible and non-anomalous.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> Simple desires appear to be fulfilled in the most straightforward manner.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 41058-02:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-41458
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to wish for "the means to escape."
- <strong>Result:</strong> SCP-41058 became a clone of the subject's own leg but with a key to standard Foundation handcuffs embedded in the shin. The clone leg was non-viable and lifeless.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-41058 seems capable of dark humor or an interpretation of wishes that is overly literal.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 41058-03:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Ennis
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Dr. Ennis asked for "an end to violence."
- <strong>Result:</strong> No observable change to SCP-41058.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> Hypothesis: SCP-41058 cannot fulfill abstract or grand-scale desires.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 41058-04:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-41500
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to request "a companion."
- <strong>Result:</strong> SCP-41058 transformed into a common domesticated dog (Canis lupus familiaris), breed unknown, which displayed affectionate behavior towards the subject.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-41058 capable of creating living organisms. Ethical considerations for further testing involving sentient life forms recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 41058-05:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> Research Assistant Lin
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject asked for "a better version of SCP-41058's containment locker."
- <strong>Result:</strong> SCP-41058 transformed into a similar locker, except made from a higher grade of steel and equipped with an electronic keypad lock.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> 'Better' is subjective; SCP-41058 might interpret it based on the object's purpose.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident 41058-A</h3>
<p>Following Experiment 41058-05, SCP-41058 was temporarily relocated to the newly created containment locker it had generated. During this time, janitorial staff member â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, unaware of SCP-41058's properties, wished out loud for "a way out of this godforsaken job." SCP-41058 immediately transformed into a resignation letter, pre-signed by â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, which incidentally led to â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ's termination of employment. </p>
<p>This incident has prompted a review of containment protocols, particularly emphasizing the importance of information control and the need for all personnel interacting with SCP-41058, regardless of clearance level, to undergo comprehensive briefing on its anomalous properties.</p>
