<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-20121 is  the ZWB (Zombies Without Borders)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20121<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20121</i> is a phenomenon in which hordes of zombies, designated ZWB-1 through ZWB-███, spontaneously manifest in various locations across the globe. The zombies are all physically identical and display no anomalous properties other than their ability to spontaneously appear.<br><br>The zombies have been observed to move in large groups, typically ranging from several dozen to several hundred individuals. They do not appear to be affected by any form of damage or injury and are capable of moving at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph).<br><br>The primary purpose of the zombie hordes appears to be the acquisition of human corpses for unknown purposes; they will actively seek out humans who have recently died or are near death and collect them into piles before disappearing. It is currently unknown what happens with these bodies after they are collected.<br><br>Zombies that have been killed will remain dead until another horde manifests, at which point they will reanimate and join the new group. There does not appear to be any limit on how many times a zombie can resurrect itself in this manner.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-20121</i>, containment is not possible. Instead, Foundation personnel are to monitor news reports and social media for any signs of zombie activity and respond accordingly.<br><br>In the event that a horde is encountered, MTF units are to be dispatched as soon as possible in order to contain or eliminate the threat. Any corpses collected by the zombies should be retrieved for further study.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 20121.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a horde of ZWB-1 zombies was encountered in [REDACTED], France. The group was quickly contained by MTF units and all corpses collected were retrieved for further study.<br><br>Analysis of the bodies revealed that they had been dead for several days prior to being reanimated. It is believed that <i>SCP-20121</i> has the ability to resurrect recently deceased humans, though it is not yet clear how this process works or what its limits are.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20121.2: </h3> Interview with ZWB-1<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation agent was able to make contact with an individual from the first zombie horde (designated ZWB-1). The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> Can you tell me why you are here? What do you want?<br><b><br>ZWB-1:</b> We are here to gather the dead. They must be taken away so that they can be at peace.<br><b><br>Agent:</b> Taken away? Where?<br><b><br>ZWB-1:</b> To the afterlife. We are here to help them find their way.<br><b><br>Agent:</b> How do you know where the afterlife is?<br><b><br>ZWB-1:</b> We are guided by a higher power. We cannot say more than that.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20121.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 20121.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, a horde of ZWB-███ zombies was encountered in [REDACTED], France. MTF units were dispatched to contain the horde and collect any corpses it had acquired.<br><br>The corpses were taken back to Site-██ for further study. Autopsies revealed that the bodies had been drained of all bodily fluids and organs, with only their skeletons remaining intact. No trace of any anomalous activity was detected in the remains or surrounding area.</div>
