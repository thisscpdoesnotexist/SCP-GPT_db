The book has an unknown amount of pages, but it seems to be infinite. It will always have a page for each person alive, and if said person has died, it will still have a page for them. The pages are written in an unknown language, but the text can be replaced by any other text written on any other page.<br><br>When someone opens <i>SCP-16894</i> and reads its contents out loud, they will start to experience events similar to what is written in the book. However, these events may or may not happen in chronological order; some events that were supposed to happen before others might occur after them instead. These events usually only affect the subject who opened <i>SCP-16894</i> , but some cases show that they also affect people around him/her as well (see Addendum 16894-1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16894.2 : </h3>Interview with  ██████ ████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b>  ██████ ████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Subject was one of the first test subjects for <i>SCP-16894</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, Mr. ████, how are you feeling? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>I'm fine, thanks for asking. It's just that… I've been having these dreams lately… <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Dreams? What kind of dreams? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Well… they're not really nightmares or anything like that; they're just weird and confusing sometimes… They always start out with me sitting in my room, reading a book or something like that when suddenly this voice starts talking to me and telling me things about myself that I don't even know about! And then it just shows me images from my past and stuff like that… It's really disturbing at times! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hmm… Do you remember what the voice said to you during your last dream? Subject pauses for a moment before answering . <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Yes, I do actually! The voice said <i>"You will get married to someone who has never met you before."</i> And then it showed me an image of myself marrying some guy who looked exactly like my best friend from college! But he never went to college; he dropped out his senior year because his parents got divorced and he wanted to help them with their business instead of finishing school… So why would the book show him as a future husband if we've only known each other since high school?! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was conducted, subject received an anonymous letter stating <i>"I have never met you before,"</i> signed by someone named <i>"John Smith"</i>. Two weeks later , subject married John Smith after meeting him at her job in a coffee shop where she worked as a waitress .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16894.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>16894-1: </b>D-16894 is instructed to open <i>SCP-16894</i> and read the contents out loud.<br><br><b>Result: </b>D-16894 starts experiencing events that are written in the book. The first event is a car crash, then an explosion, and finally a plane crash. The order of these events is different from what was written in the book (see Addendum 16894-1). After these events occur, D-16894 dies of cardiac arrest.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>16894-2: </b>Another D Class subject is instructed to open <i>SCP-16894</i> and read its contents out loud. This time, he reads about a plane crash that occurs before the other events do (see Addendum 16894-1). After he reads about this event happening, it actually occurs in reality as well; however, it does not cause his death since he was not on board at the time of its occurrence.<br><br></div>
