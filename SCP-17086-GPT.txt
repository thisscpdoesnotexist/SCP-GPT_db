The objective of the experiment was to test the entity's ability to manipulate space-time and travel through alternate timelines. A portal was created by <i>SCP-17086</i> in its containment cell, leading to a timeline in which humans had achieved interstellar travel.<br><br>The research team entered the portal and spent approximately one hour exploring this alternate timeline before returning to their own. During this time, they observed various aspects of human life on other planets, as well as evidence of advanced technology beyond anything currently known to humanity. Upon their return, all members reported feeling disoriented and confused; however, no long term psychological effects were observed.</div>
