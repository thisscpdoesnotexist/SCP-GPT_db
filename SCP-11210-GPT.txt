How are you feeling? <br><br><b>D-11210: </b>I feel… good? Why are you asking me this? Dr. ███: No reason in particular, I was just curious as to how you were feeling today. Now, would you mind telling me what happened earlier today when the frog started dancing? D-11210 pauses for a few seconds before responding . <br><br><b>D-11210: </b>Well… it was pretty normal at first; I was sitting there like always when all of a sudden the frog starts singing and dancing! It wasn't doing anything weird or anything like that though, it just kept on singing and dancing for about an hour straight before it stopped again! It was really strange but also kind of nice too; I don't think I've ever seen something so happy before! Dr. ███ nods while writing down notes on his clipboard . After several minutes of silence he speaks up again .
