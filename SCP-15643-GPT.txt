D-███ was instructed to touch <i>SCP-15643</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-███ touched <i>SCP-15643</i>, and reported that he felt nothing unusual. However, the next day, D-███ reported that he could not remember anything from the previous day except for his name and basic motor skills. He also claimed to have been in a hotel room with several other people whom he didn't recognize. All of them were dressed in formal clothing and had their faces covered by masks or makeup of some sort.
