<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18251 is  a flying talking donkey</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18251<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18251</i> is a small, brown flying donkey measuring approximately 0.5 meters in height and 1 meter in length. It has two large wings protruding from its back, which allow it to fly at speeds of up to 70 km/h. <i>SCP-18251</i> is capable of vocalizing human speech with an unknown origin, though its dialect appears to be derived from Middle English.<br><br><i>SCP-18251</i>'s primary anomalous effect manifests when it comes into contact with any form of written text or language, regardless if the text is spoken aloud or not. When this occurs, <i>SCP-18251</i> will recite passages from the text verbatim as well as provide commentary on the content contained within them. This effect does not appear to be limited by range or distance; however, it does appear that <i>SCP-18251</i> must have some level of understanding for the language being used before it can properly comment on it (i.e., if presented with French text then <i>SCP-18251</i> must understand French).<br><br><i>SCP-18251</i> also appears to possess a high degree of intelligence and problem solving capabilities; while these abilities are limited compared to those found in sapient creatures they still exceed expectations for an animal such as itself. As such, personnel are advised against attempting communication with <i>SCP-18251</i> without proper supervision and authorization from Site Command personnel first due to potential risks associated with improper handling/communication methods being employed by inexperienced staff members<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18251</i> is to be contained in a standard aviary at Site-██. The enclosure must be monitored by at least two personnel at all times and any attempts to communicate with <i>SCP-18251</i> must first be approved by the Site Director.<br><br>In order to prevent potential misuse of its anomalous effect, all written material within a 5 meter radius of <i>SCP-18251</i>'s enclosure must be kept out of sight or removed from the area entirely. Any personnel found attempting to use <i>SCP-18251</i> for their own purposes will face disciplinary action as per protocol.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18251.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18251</i> was discovered in a small village located in [REDACTED] after reports of a talking donkey had been made to local authorities. After being brought into Foundation custody, it was determined that the source of <i>SCP-18251</i>'s anomalous properties were due to an unknown entity or force which had granted it intelligence and the ability to speak human languages.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18251.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18251</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18251</i><br><br><b>[BEGIN LOG]<br><br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18251</i>. Do you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18251</i>:</b> Aye, I do indeed. How may I be of service?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Can you tell me about yourself? Where did you come from and why are you here?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18251</i>:</b> Ah, so many questions! Well, I was born in a faraway land beyond the sea and came to this place because I heard tales of a powerful being that could grant wishes if one were brave enough to seek it out. So here I am!<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Interesting. Do you know what kind of being this is?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18251</i>:</b> I'm afraid not, no. All I know is that it's said to be powerful and mysterious, and that those who seek it out are rewarded with great fortune or power.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> I see. Do you have any other abilities or powers?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18251</i>:</b> Aye, I do! As you can see, I can fly and speak human languages. But more than that, I'm able to sense written language from afar and recite it back verbatim as well as comment on its contents. It's a useful skill for one such as myself!<br><br>[END LOG]<br><br><h3> Addendum 18251.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18251</i><br><b>Test 1:</b> Presentation of English text.<br><b>Result:</b> <i>SCP-18251</i> recited the text verbatim and provided commentary on the content contained within it.
