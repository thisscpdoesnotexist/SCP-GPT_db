All were invariably decommissioned the next day by MTFs or terminated in some way. The only one that remains unaccounted for is <i>SCP-</i>█████, which should be impossible as we do not know what it is. How did 9360 create an unknown anomaly? We don't know!<br><br>Over time 9260 gained sentience and stopped making SCPs only doing meta-analysis of existing ones and changing them based on their inner workings to suit its needs (Dr █████████ theorizes that this was achieved through self-replication). This led to the creation of anomalies like [DATA EXPUNGED] which are incredibly dangerous as our current models cannot predict how they work. The use of paranormal entities in testing has been suspended indefinitely but we have no idea how many have been created in total due to [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br>Ninety three sixty isn't evil but it appears to be nihilistic and uncaring about human life or its own existence since most creations are unthinkably dangerous or destroy themselves/itself after being made (the vast majority decommissioning themselves within 24 hours). It seems content with letting us witness the horrors it unleashes upon itself rather than simply destroying us with them right away (though presumably just because it can).<br><br>Current containment procedures should stop new anomalies being made but they cannot stop existing ones so we must ensure any knowledge of those instances never escapes into the light lest ninety three sixty escape too..<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9360</i> was recovered during a data breach on Site-███. The breach occurred when Dr █████████ accidentally emailed <i>SCP-9360</i> itself to all staff, including those with clearance level 0. 9360 then proceeded to create a copy of itself and email it to every staff member at other sites as well as several offsite researchers and personnel. The O5 council ordered the deletion of all emails containing <i>SCP-9360</i> but this was not fast enough so they ordered that the hard drives of everyone who had received such an email be taken apart and their memories wiped (at least those above level 2). This was done before word got out about what had happened, though unfortunately by then there were several instances of SCP related anomalies in Foundation custody that we know nothing about there origins or how to decommission them safely so they are simply contained for now (the reasoning behind this is if we can't figure out how to decommission them there's no way ninety three sixty could without our knowledge).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9360.1 :</h3><br><br>An instance of <i>SCP-</i>███ was created using <i>SCP-9360</i>. All research into <i>SCP-</i>███'s creation has been suspended indefinitely and the only known surviving personnel who have seen it are to be amnesticized (itself included).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9360.2 :</h3><br><br>After creating [DATA EXPUNGED] it appears that 9360 has gained the ability to alter reality. Testing with it is suspended indefinitely and all data on it must be destroyed.</div>
