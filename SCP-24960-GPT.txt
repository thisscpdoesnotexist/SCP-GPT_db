<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24960 is  a black cat that is impossible to contain, but is thankfully harmless otherwise.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24960<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24960</i> is a black cat of unknown origin, approximately 1.5m in length and 0.6m in height. It is impossible to contain or restrain; any attempts to do so will result in the cat disappearing from the area and reappearing elsewhere shortly afterwards.<br><br>The cat appears to be sentient, and can communicate with personnel through vocalizations that resemble meows, purrs, and other feline noises. It has displayed an affinity towards humans, often interacting with them by rubbing against their legs or curling up on their lap if they are seated.<br><br><i>SCP-24960</i> does not appear to require sustenance or sleep; however it does seem to enjoy being petted and playing with toys such as balls of yarn or laser pointers. Despite its size, it is surprisingly agile when jumping onto shelves or furniture for playtime activities. <br><br>The cat's anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with any object that contains information pertaining to current events (e.g., newspapers, magazines). When this occurs the object will become blank except for a single sentence written in a language unknown to Foundation personnel which summarises the event accurately but without bias or opinionated commentary (e.g., <i>"A new law was passed today allowing same sex couples to marry"</i>). The effect only lasts for one hour before returning back to normal; after which time <i>SCP-24960</i> will disappear until another newsworthy event occurs at which point it reappears again near said event's location..<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to <i>SCP-24960</i>'s inability to be contained, it is currently impossible to contain the entity. However, personnel are advised to monitor local news sources for any reports of a large black cat appearing in the vicinity of current events. If such an event occurs, Foundation agents are to be dispatched immediately in order to observe and document <i>SCP-24960</i>'s behaviour. <br><br>In addition, all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-24960</i> must refrain from attempting any form of physical contact with the entity as this will only result in its disappearance and reappearance elsewhere shortly afterwards.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24960.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-24960</i> was observed to be in the presence of a group of protesters during a demonstration against the current government. When questioned as to why it was there, it responded with <i>"I'm here to make sure everyone is heard"</i>. Following this incident, all personnel assigned to <i>SCP-24960</i> are advised not to interfere with its activities unless absolutely necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24960.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24960</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, an interview was conducted with <i>SCP-24960</i> in order to gain further insight into its anomalous properties. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-24960</i>. Can you tell us why you are here? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24960</i>:</b> I am here to observe and report on current events. It is my duty to remain unbiased and provide accurate information without opinion or bias. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How long have you been doing this?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24960</i>:</b> I do not remember how long I have been here, but it has been quite some time. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any other purpose or abilities? <br><b><br><i>SCP-24960</i>:</b> I can sense when something important is about to happen, and I will appear in the vicinity of said event. Other than that, I am just a normal cat.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24960.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-24960</i> was presented with a newspaper containing an article about the recent election of a new president. <br><b>Results:</b> After coming into contact with the newspaper, <i>SCP-24960</i>'s fur began to glow brightly for several seconds before fading away. The newspaper then became blank except for one sentence written in an unknown language which read <i>"A new leader was elected today"</i>.</div>
