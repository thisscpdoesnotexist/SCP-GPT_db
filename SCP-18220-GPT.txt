When provoked or threatened by a victim, <i>SCP-18220</i> will attempt to retaliate with greater force than before.<br><br>Once the victim has been doxxed, they will find themselves subject to an array of online harassment and threats from anonymous sources across various social media platforms and websites. The harassment typically involves threats of physical violence and/or extortion demands for money or services from the victim's family members or friends. In some cases, this harassment can extend offline as well with further attempts at intimidation or blackmail through mailings and phone calls made directly to the victim's home address or contacts list.<br><br><i>SCP-18220</i> does not appear capable of being contained using conventional means due to its ability to travel freely between digital networks without detection by security protocols; however research into methods for containing it are ongoing at this time.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-18220</i>'s anomalous abilities, containment is not possible at this time. Instead, Foundation personnel are to monitor online activity for any signs of <i>SCP-18220</i>'s presence and take appropriate action when necessary.<br><br>In addition, all personnel are advised to avoid contact with the leprechaun or anyone associated with it in order to minimize potential exposure.

Foundation agents were dispatched to the area and located the leprechaun's residence, a small cottage situated at the edge of a forest. Upon entering the building, agents found that it had been abandoned for some time; however, several documents were discovered which appeared to be written by <i>SCP-18220</i> detailing its various grievances with humanity. These documents have been collected and are currently under review by Foundation researchers for further analysis.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18220.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18220</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, Foundation personnel conducted an interview with <i>SCP-18220</i> in order to gain a better understanding of its motivations.

I seek revenge for what they have done.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What have they done?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18220</i>:</b> They have taken away my home and my people.
