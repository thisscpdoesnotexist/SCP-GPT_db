After MTF Eta-11 (<i>"Damn Feds"</i>) were sent in to investigate, they managed to capture <i>SCP-10893</i> and transport it back into Site 19 for containment purposes.<br><br><i>SCP-10893</i> has been contained within Site 19's Low Security Containment Zone (LSCZ) since its discovery on █/██/200█. It has been contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with no security breaches or any type of escape attempts made by <i>SCP-10893</i> since its arrival at Site 19. All requests for testing have been denied due to lack of interest from researchers assigned at Site 19 due to its status as an anomalous videogame character that lacks any anomalous properties besides it being able to interact with humans without causing any harm towards them or vice versa.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10893.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, a Foundation Researcher assigned at Site 19.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. S████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted in order to find out more information about <i>SCP-10893</i>'s origin and how it came into existence. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. S████: </b>Hello, sir! How are you doing today? █████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>I'm doing just fine, doctor! How are you? <br><br><b>Dr. S████: </b>I'm doing just fine as well! Now, let's start this interview shall we? █████ █194███ nods his head in agreement before proceeding to answer the following questions asked by Dr. S████████ . <br><br><b>Dr. S████████: </b>So… <i>SCP-10893</i> has been contained within Site 19 for quite some time now and it has been requested for testing numerous times but all requests were denied due to lack of interest from researchers assigned at Site 19 due to its status as an anomalous videogame character that lacks any anomalous properties besides it being able to interact with humans without causing any harm towards them or vice versa . Do you know why they would deny testing on an anomalous videogame character like <i>SCP-10893</i>? __________ <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Well… There is no real reason why they would deny testing on <i>SCP-10893</i> other than the fact that there is no real reason for them to do so since there have been no reports of any type of escape attempts or containment breaches made by 10893 since its arrival at Site 19 , and also because we don't really have anyone who actually cares about 10893 other than myself . Besides that, I think they're afraid of what might happen if someone actually tries conducting tests on 10892 since they might end up getting harmed or worse killed if someone decides to go berserk with their power . That's my opinion anyway . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further research into the background information regarding 10892 was conducted, researchers discovered that there were numerous reports of sightings and encounters with 10892 before its discovery by MTF Eta-11 (<i>"Damn Feds"</i>). It seems as though people were aware of the existence of 10892 even before it was discovered by Foundation personnel which raises many questions regarding how exactly did these people know about this anomaly in the first place considering how obscure this anomaly is when compared to other anomalies known within our database such as Keter class anomalies or Euclid class anomalies such as [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 10893.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 10893.3 - Experiment Log 10893.3 Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10893</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is to enter <i>SCP-10893</i>'s containment cell and interact with it for 2 hours. After the experiment, D-9341 is to be questioned about his experience with <i>SCP-10893</i> and its behavior during the experiment. <br><br><b>Results: </b>The following is an audio transcript of the experiment conducted between D-9341 and <i>SCP-10893</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please tell us what happened after you entered into the containment cell of <i>SCP-10993</i>, please start from when you first entered into its containment cell until when you had left it again after 2 hours have passed since entering it. <br><br><b>D#93412: </b>Alright, I'll tell ya what happened… So I got in there and this thing just looked at me for a few seconds before saying <i>"Hey! You're that guy from that Sonic game!"</i> I was like <i>"What?"</i> And then he said <i>"You know… That guy who looks like Shadow but has a different color scheme."</i> Then he started rambling on about how awesome Shadow was in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle or something like that… So yeah, we talked for a while before I decided to leave him alone so he could get some rest since we were going to do an interview afterwards anyways… Dr.: Alright, thank you very much for your time and cooperation during this interview process with SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED]. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>No other tests were conducted on <i>SCP-10993</i> due to lack of interest from researchers assigned at Site 19 due to its status as an anomalous videogame character that lacks any anomalous properties besides interacting with humans without causing any harm towards them or vice versa .<br><br></div>
