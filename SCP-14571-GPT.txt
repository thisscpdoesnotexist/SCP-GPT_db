The couple were going to put the statue on their table but when they touched it, they immediately started to feel pain and had scars on them. They then called for help and the police came and took away <i>SCP-14571</i>. The police then brought it to Site-██. When scientists tried to do an analysis on <i>SCP-14571</i>, they got injured as well when they touched it. Then one scientist suggested that we should put this statue inside of an airtight container so no one could touch it anymore but we also needed someone who can touch this object without getting hurt or injured so we have chosen Agent ██████ as our <i>"Test Subject"</i>. Agent ██████ went inside of the container with <i>SCP-14571</i> and he touched it without feeling any pain or getting hurt at all. After that he went out of the container with no injuries at all and told us that he didn't feel anything weird about touching this object except for some slight pressure on his hand but nothing else happened after that so now we are able to do tests on SCP- 1457 1 safely .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14571.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Agent ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.███████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.███████: </b>So, Agent ██████ , how are you doing?
