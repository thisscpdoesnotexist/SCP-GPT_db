<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17103 is  a gothic cathedral dam built by beavers</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17103<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17103</i> is a large structure of unknown origin, located in a remote area of ████████ forest. The structure appears to be constructed entirely out of dark grey stone, and takes the form of a gothic cathedral dam.<br><br>The dam itself is approximately 30 meters tall and 13 meters wide at its base, with walls that are up to 2 meters thick. The interior contains numerous chambers and passageways leading throughout the structure. At its highest point, <i>SCP-17103</i> stands over 50 meters above ground level.<br><br><i>SCP-17103</i> has been determined to have been built by an unknown species of beaver (Castoridae sp.), which inhabit the area surrounding it in large numbers. These beavers appear to possess advanced engineering capabilities; they are capable of constructing complex structures from locally available materials without any visible tools or machinery being employed in their construction process. It is currently unknown how these creatures manage to construct such an impressive feat as <i>SCP-17103</i> without assistance from any outside sources or technology.<br><br>In addition, several anomalous properties have been observed within <i>SCP-17103</i>; most notably: <br>• All attempts at breaching the walls have resulted in failure regardless of tool used for excavation or destruction; <br>• Any living organism attempting to enter <i>SCP-17103</i> will become disoriented and unable to recall how they arrived there; <br>• All attempts at communication with any inhabitants within <i>SCP-17103</i> have failed due to lack of response from said inhabitants; <br>• No sound can be heard coming from inside <i>SCP-17103</i> despite numerous attempts made by personnel stationed outside it's perimeter; <br>• No light can penetrate beyond the entrance chamber into other areas within it's confines despite multiple tests conducted using various illumination devices including flashlights and spotlights .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17103</i> is to be monitored by a team of personnel stationed at the perimeter. Any attempts to breach the walls of <i>SCP-17103</i> are strictly forbidden and will result in immediate disciplinary action. All personnel entering <i>SCP-17103</i> must be equipped with a tracking device and accompanied by two armed guards, who will remain outside the entrance chamber at all times.<br><br>In order to prevent any further construction of anomalous structures within its vicinity, an automated system has been set up around <i>SCP-17103</i> which utilizes sonic waves to deter any potential builders from approaching it's perimeter.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17103.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a team of personnel were sent into <i>SCP-17103</i> to investigate its interior. Upon entering the chamber beyond the entrance, they encountered a large number of beavers which immediately began constructing an additional structure within the chamber. The structure was determined to be an exact replica of <i>SCP-17103</i>, and upon completion it disappeared without a trace.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17103.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17103</i>'s Constructors<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of personnel were sent to investigate <i>SCP-17103</i> and attempt to communicate with its constructors. Upon arriving at the perimeter, they were immediately confronted by a large group of beavers which began communicating in an unknown language. After several attempts at establishing contact, one of the beavers stepped forward and spoke in broken English:<br><b><br>Beaver:</b> We are the builders of this dam. It is our home and we will protect it with our lives if necessary. <br><b><br>Personnel:</b> Why did you build this? <br><b>Beaver:</b> To keep us safe from those who would do us harm. We have seen what humans can do when they are threatened and we wanted to be prepared. <br><b><br>Personnel:</b> What do you mean by <i>"prepared"</i>? <br><b>Beaver:</b> We have built this dam to protect us from any potential threats that may come our way. We are confident that it will keep us safe for many years to come.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17103.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> On ██/██/20██, personnel attempted to breach the walls of <i>SCP-17103</i> using a variety of tools including drills and explosives. All attempts failed regardless of tool used for excavation or destruction.<br><b><br>Experiment #2:</b> On ██/██/20██, personnel attempted to communicate with any potential inhabitants within <i>SCP-17103</i> by shouting into the entrance chamber. No response was received from any occupants inside it's confines.</div>
