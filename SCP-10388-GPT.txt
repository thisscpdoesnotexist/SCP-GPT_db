Foundation agents embedded in the police force were able to successfully contain <i>SCP-10388</i> and transport it to Site-██ for further study.<br><br><i>SCP-10388</i> has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent English and has claimed responsibility for several minor incidents <br><br><b>including: </b>[REDACTED]. When questioned about these claims, <i>SCP-10388</i> responded by saying <i>"I'm not going to deny it."</i> However, when questioned about its motives for committing these acts, <i>SCP-10388</i> refused to comment. These claims have been corroborated by eyewitnesses who claim that they saw a large talking horse commit these acts. The credibility of these witnesses has been called into question due to their belief that they saw a giant talking horse commit these acts . It should be noted that there are no known instances of horses capable of speech in reality . Due to this fact and other inconsistencies with the witnesses' accounts (e.g., how could anyone mistake a normal sized horse for something as large as what was described), all information provided by said witnesses should be considered highly suspect at best until more information can be obtained from other sources or confirmed by further experimentation on 103888 itself .

Upon being discovered by guards, <i>SCP-10388</i> proceeded to attempt to assault the guards by kicking them with its hind legs and biting them with its front teeth. All guards involved in this incident were treated for injuries and subsequently released from medical care.<br><br>After a short struggle between 103888 and the guards, it was successfully restrained using tranquilizer darts; however, before it could be returned back into containment it escaped from Site-██'s primary perimeter . Security footage from Site-██'s security cameras shows that after escaping containment 103888 proceeded north towards [REDACTED] where it evaded Foundation personnel for several days before disappearing completely . It is believed that due to the nature of <i>SCP-10388</i>'s anomalous properties (see Addendum 103888A), it may still be at large somewhere within [REDACTED] .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10388.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████ - Hide <h3>Addendum 10388.2 : </h3>On ██/██/████, an interview was conducted with a resident of [REDACTED] who claimed to have seen <i>SCP-10388</i> while it was at large in the area. Several inconsistencies with the previous accounts given by other witnesses have been noted; however, due to the credibility of this witness being higher than that of others previously interviewed (see Interview Logs), this information should be considered reliable until more information can be obtained from other sources or confirmed by further experimentation on 103888 itself . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Good afternoon Mr. █████! I'd like you tell me about what you saw regarding <i>SCP-10388</i> if you don't mind?<br><br>Mr.: Sure thing doc! It was just like any normal day when I heard a loud bang outside my house and went outside to see what happened when suddenly outta nowhere this giant talking horse comes up and starts attacking me! So naturally I got scared and ran inside my house but it followed me in there so I hid under my bed for several hours until it left . Dr.: Thank you for your time Mr. █████, we will contact you again if we need anything else!<br><br>Mr.: No problem doc, good luck catching that thing! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It is believed that <i>SCP-10388</i> may still be hiding somewhere within [REDACTED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 10388.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Hide Experiment Log Test #: 103888-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10388</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-92983 is instructed to approach <i>SCP-10388</i> and attempt to communicate with it. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon being approached by D-92983, <i>SCP-10388</i> immediately charges at him at full speed and attempts to bite him.
