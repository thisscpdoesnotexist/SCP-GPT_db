The space appears to be a combination of a physical and mental environment, where Johnson creates his music videos. It contains various objects that are related to his works, such as instruments, recording equipment and props for his videos.<br><br>The most notable feature of <i>SCP-18993</i> is its ability to manipulate reality in order to create the desired effect for any given video. This includes altering physical laws in order to make the impossible possible (e.g. allowing Johnson's character <i>"Doin' Your Mom"</i> to fly). Furthermore, it has been observed that when inside <i>SCP-18993</i>, time passes at an accelerated rate; this allows him to complete projects much faster than normal outside of it.<br><br>In addition, while inside <i>SCP-18993</i> Johnson exhibits enhanced creativity and problem solving abilities; this has allowed him to create some of his more popular songs with ease despite their complexity or difficulty level compared with other works he has created outside the space.<br><br>Finally, due to its anomalous nature and potential for misuse if exposed or accessed by unauthorized personnel or entities outside of Ray William Johnson's control it is classified as Keter<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-18993</i>, containment is impossible. As such, all efforts must be made to ensure that Johnson remains unaware of its existence and does not attempt to access it.<br><br>To this end, Foundation personnel are to monitor Johnson's activities for any signs of anomalous activity or attempts at accessing <i>SCP-18993</i>. In addition, all personnel assigned to monitor Johnson are required to undergo psychological evaluations every six months in order to ensure they remain mentally stable and able to perform their duties without issue.<br><br>In the event that Johnson discovers or attempts access <i>SCP-18993</i>, MTF Epsilon-9 (<i>"Dreamcatchers"</i>) is tasked with containing him and administering Class A amnestics as necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18993.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, Johnson released a music video titled <i>"Doin' Your Mom"</i>, which was filmed inside <i>SCP-18993</i>. The video quickly became popular and has been viewed over ████ times as of ██/██/20██. Due to its potential for misuse, the Foundation has taken steps to ensure that the video is not widely distributed or made available outside of Johnson's control.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18993.2: </h3> Interview with Ray William Johnson<br><br>On ██/██/20██, Ray William Johnson was interviewed by Foundation personnel in order to gain further information on <i>SCP-18993</i>. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How did you discover <i>SCP-18993</i>?<br><b><br>Johnson:</b> I'm not sure. One day, I was working on a song and suddenly it felt like I was in a different place. Everything around me seemed to be made of music and sound, and I could do anything I wanted with it. It's hard to explain, but it just felt right.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know how to access <i>SCP-18993</i>?<br><b><br>Johnson:</b> No, I don't. It just kind of happens when I'm working on something. It's like it knows what I need and when I need it.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Have you ever tried to access <i>SCP-18993</i> outside of your work?<br><b><br>Johnson:</b> No, not really. It's a place that's special to me and my music, so I don't want to risk messing it up by trying something new.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18993.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, Johnson was brought into <i>SCP-18993</i> in order to observe the effects of its anomalous properties. During this experiment, Johnson was observed creating a new song with relative ease and speed. The song he created was later released as <i>"Doin' Your Mom"</i>.</div>
