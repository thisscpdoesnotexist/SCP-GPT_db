It is unclear what motivates <i>SCP-17195</i>'s destructive behavior; however, it appears that it does not discriminate between targets and will attack anything in its path regardless of size or value.<br><br>In addition to its physical abilities, <i>SCP-17195</i> also possesses a limited form of precognition; this allows it to anticipate attacks before they occur and react accordingly. This ability has proven invaluable in combat situations against multiple opponents at once.<br><br><i>SCP-17195</i> also displays some degree of intelligence; while it cannot converse with humans due to language barriers, it can understand basic commands given by personnel when necessary for containment procedures.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17195</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be reinforced with titanium plating and equipped with an automated defense system capable of neutralizing <i>SCP-17195</i> if it attempts to escape.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-17195</i> are not permitted to engage it directly; instead, they must use nonlethal methods such as tranquilizers or stun guns when attempting to contain it. In the event that lethal force becomes necessary, personnel are advised to exercise extreme caution due to <i>SCP-17195</i>'s superhuman strength and agility.<br><br>In order to prevent further destruction caused by <i>SCP-17195</i>, all personnel assigned to its containment must remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity immediately.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17195.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17195</i> was encountered by a Foundation agent in [REDACTED], France. The entity had caused massive destruction to the city, and the agent was able to contain it with minimal casualties.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 17195.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17195</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17195</i> was interviewed by Dr. ███████ in order to gain a better understanding of its motivations and behavior. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> What do you want? Why are you here?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17195</i>:</b> I seek power… To become powerful enough that no one can stand against me. I want to be feared and respected by all who oppose me.<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Why do you cause destruction?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17195</i>:</b> Destruction is the only way I can achieve my goals. It is the only way to ensure that no one will stand in my way.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17195.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17195.1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17195</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> The subject was placed in a reinforced containment chamber and instructed to remain still. A series of objects, ranging from small items such as pencils to large objects such as chairs, were then placed within the chamber. The subject was instructed to manipulate the objects with his hands in order to demonstrate his powers.<br><b><br>Results:</b> <i>SCP-17195</i> demonstrated its ability by easily manipulating all of the objects without any visible effort on its part; it was also able to move them at high speeds and launch them across the room with devastating force. It is believed that this power is what allows <i>SCP-17195</i> to cause destruction on a massive scale when outside of containment.</div>
