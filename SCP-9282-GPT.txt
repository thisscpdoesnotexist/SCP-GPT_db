They can not be stopped or shot down. They also have a strong romantic relationship with each other, and will often become skittish if they are separated for too long (see Addendum 2).<br><br><i>SCP-9282</i>-1 & <i>SCP-9282</i>-2 never stop flying around the Earth. If anything gets in their way they will just fly over it or through it (See Addendum 3). There has been at least ███ casualties due to <i>SCP-9282</i>'s existence, but no one has ever seen them do anything harmful besides accidentally running into stuff and killing people.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9282</i> was recovered when someone saw them flying in the sky, and reported it to the local police. They called a nearby military base that had jurisdiction over said area. They sent out a MQ-9 Reaper drone to investigate, but the moment they got close they crashed into <i>SCP-9282</i> and were shot down by 9282-2. The Foundation was then alerted of what had happened, and sent out a recovery team to retrieve <i>SCP-9282</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9282.1 :</h3> Recovery Interview<br><br><br>Foreword: The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9282</i> was recovered. <Begin Log> Dr.<br>███████: So, tell me about these planes. What do they look like?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9282</i>-1: They're the most beautiful things you've ever seen! They're just a bit darker than the sky itself, but not as dark as a storm cloud on a sunny day! Dr.<br>███████: What are they made out of?<br> <i>SCP-9282</i>-1: Well, [<i>SCP-928</i>] is made out of titanium tetrachloride, and [<i>SCP-928</i>] is made out of uranium tetrachloride! I was going to ask if we could make them get married so they can have kids together but then I remembered that the Foundation isn't allowed to do that kind of stuff anymore. Dr. ████████ Oh… right… Can you tell me how you got here?<br> SCP - 9282 - 1 : Well it all started when this guy from some group called 'The Chaos Insurgency' sold us off to this other guy who said he needed us for some illegal smuggling job or something like that. I don't know what he wanted to smuggle in or smuggle out or whatever because before we knew it we were flying over Russia and Japan and China and Australia and New Zealand (Oh my god New Zealand is amazing!) And then we were flying over Canada which is also amazing but then suddenly there was an explosion in our engine which threw us into space where someone shot us with a laser so we got knocked back down onto earth again where suddenly there's this big bird monster thing shooting at us with lightning bolts so I told [SCP 928] to shoot it back with our cannons but then it turned into an eagle monster thing so I had her try shooting at its face instead except she missed its face by about 50 meters (we should really work on our aim) And then at this point someone came up from behind me and grabbed me by my neck so he could stop me from moving while his friend tried hitting [SCP 928] with lightning strikes from his hands until finally one hit her head causing her plane to explode into pieces all around the sky before her armor fell down through earth atmosphere burning up in flames until there was nothing left except for maybe half of one wing still floating around trapped inside an air pocket somewhere *sniff* It's not fair… She didn't deserve any of that.. Why did she have to die?! She wasn't even infected by anything yet! We hadn't even been together long enough for anything like that!! Dr . ████████ Right…. Can you tell me anything else about these planes?<br> SCP - 9282 - 1 : Sorry.. That kinda took over everything.. But yeah uhm other than their titanium tetrachloride & uranium tetra Chloride composition, nothing really special actually…. Except maybe<br><br><h3>Addendum 9282.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9282</i>'s Letters<br><br><br>Foreword: The following letters were found inside <i>SCP-9282</i>-1. They were written in a combination of English and Morse Code. When translated, it was revealed that the letter said <i>"I will kill everyone on this plane so I can be with you."</i> except he sent it to his friend who was at work when he wrote it instead of the girl he wanted to date.<br><br></div>
