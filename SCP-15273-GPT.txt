The subject was discovered in 20██ after a series of reports from various sources of a <i>"SCP Video Game"</i> being developed by an unknown individual. However, all attempts to track down the creator have failed.<br><br><i>SCP-15273</i> has been known to create games based on SCP objects and SCPs themselves, as well as other anomalous entities such as GoI-004 (The Serpent's Hand) and GoI-233 (The Factory). The subject has also created several original characters that have appeared in multiple games, including Dr. Ziegler , Dr. Lament , Agent Tyla , Agent Vaktovian , Agent Blythe and [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><i>SCP-15273</i>'s first game was <i>"SCP: Containment Breach"</i>, released on ██/██/20██ for PC via Steam . This game is currently available for purchase on Steam at the price of $9.99 USD . After this release, <i>SCP-15273</i> went silent until he began working on his second video game project titled <i>"SCP: Secret Laboratory"</i>. This project was released on ██/██/20██ for PC via Steam at the price of $14.99 USD . A third title titled <i>"Containment <br><br><b>Breach: </b>Source"</i> was released shortly after as an attempt to bring back players who had lost interest in the original version due to its lack of updates since its initial release date; this version added new maps along with several new features such as coop mode and improved graphics along with bug fixes which were previously unavailable due to limitations set by Valve Corporation during development for Containment Breach's initial release date before it became available through Steam Greenlight . A fourth title titled <i>"Containment Breach 2"</i> is currently under development by SCP 152773 with no official release date set yet; however, it has been stated that it will be released sometime within 2018 or 2019 depending upon how much time 152773 can dedicate towards development while balancing his personal life outside of work hours; he also states that there will be no further updates or patches made towards any previous versions aside from any bugs found within them unless they are critical enough to cause major issues within gameplay itself aside from minor graphical errors which do not affect gameplay whatsoever like missing textures or models not loading properly such as floating limbs or heads when they should be attached towards their bodies properly instead regardless<br><br><h3>Addendum 15273.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log - Close Experiment 15273-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-1234, a 32 year old caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to play <i>SCP-15273</i>'s game <i>"SCP: Containment Breach"</i> for 30 minutes while being monitored by Foundation personnel.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 2 minutes of gameplay, subject began to complain about how the game was <i>"too dark"</i> and that he could not see anything due to the lack of lighting within the facility; this is presumed to be a minor bug within the source code for <i>SCP-15273</i>'s first release which has since been fixed in later versions. After 5 minutes of gameplay, subject reported feeling nauseous and dizzy after seeing SCP 049 crawling towards him from behind; however, no anomalous entities were present at this time within the game itself despite this statement. After 8 minutes of gameplay, subject began complaining about hearing strange whispering noises which seemed to be coming from all directions around him despite there being no such audio present in any version released thus far; these whispers are believed to have been caused by an audio loop that occurs occasionally during gameplay when certain events occur or when loading new maps but can only be heard if one is standing still while they occur as they stop once movement has begun again. At 10 minutes into his playthrough, D-1234 suddenly collapsed onto his desk while attempting to run away from an unknown entity that was chasing after him; upon further inspection by Foundation personnel monitoring his progress via CCTV footage taken directly from his computer screen , it appeared as if he had suffered a heart attack and died instantly on site. An autopsy performed immediately following confirmed this suspicion with signs of severe coronary artery disease found throughout D-1234's body along with several other health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure . It should also be noted that even though there were no anomalous entities present within SCP 049's containment chamber at any point during D-1234's playthrough aside from its own model itself (which does not appear until approximately 3 hours into playing), it is believed that SCP 049 somehow still managed to kill D-1234 regardless due to its passive ability known as <i>"The Quickening"</i> which causes anyone who looks directly at it for too long without wearing protective eye wear (even through a camera feed) will begin convulsing violently before [DATA EXPUNGED] Results written on paper attached below autopsy report along with note stating <i>"I don't fucking believe it!"</i> written in red ink across top edge of page . Upon viewing footage recorded by CCTV cameras located inside containment chambers containing other SCPs contained within Containment Breach , researchers discovered that each instance would become active whenever someone looked directly at them through their camera feeds or attempted physical contact unless they wore protective eye wear or used some form of protection against looking directly at them such as turning off their monitor screens or closing their eyes altogether until said instance goes back into standby mode once more . This suggests that all instances contained within Containment Breach are capable of seeing what happens outside their individual containment cells regardless if anyone else can see them doing so or not . However, testing has shown otherwise since many instances do not react whatsoever even when someone looks straight at them through their camera feed instead suggesting either a programming error on 152773 's part or simply just poor AI coding overall due either way , so whether this is actually true remains up for debate amongst staff members assigned towards research regarding SCP - 152773 's works . + Experiment Log - Close <h3>Addendum 15273.4 : </h3>On ██/██/20██ , Dr Lament managed t o hack int o Dr Ziegler' s account on th e Steam Workshop where she found several unfinished projects created by 152773 including one titled <i>"SCP - Secret Laboratory v2"</i>. Due t o her clearance level w hich allowed her access t o view th e files contained w ithin th e workshop , she decided t o take advantage o f her position and steal copies f rom each project before uploading them int o her own workshop account under th e name G ryphonGames96 instead hoping n otice would n ot b e taken ; however , unbeknownst t o Lament herself , Dr Ziegler had already noticed something wrong w ith her account and notified security regarding possible unauthorized access attempts made towards her personal account shortly before discovering what had happened moments later once she logged back onto Steam herself ; unfortunately f or</div>
