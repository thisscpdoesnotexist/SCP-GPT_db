After having been taken in by several foster families over the course of seven years , none were willing to take her after finding out about her anomalous properties . Addendum 9936 . 3: Incident Report On 12 / 1 0 / 20 1 7 , D - 6 2 0 3 became involved in an altercation with another inmate while playing basketball during recreational time inside his cell block . During this altercation , D - 6 2 0 3 accidentally struck another inmate named Gertrude Smithson in the head with a basketball while attempting to score a basket on him from behind ; causing severe brain damage and resulting in Ms Smithson 's death three days later due to complications from said injury . In response t o this incident, O5 Council approved Procedure 999 <i>"The Great Equalizer"</i> ; which states that all inmates must be treated equally regardless of their crimes or crimes committed against them until such time as they can be safely contained within our facilities without risk of harm coming into contact with other inmates again . O5 Council further authorized Procedure 999 <i>"The Great Equalizer"</i> ; stating that all inmates must be terminated via use of lethal force if deemed necessary by Site Director level personnel upon review from Ethics Committee Chairman Level personnel within 24 hours following an incident involving harm being caused towards another inmate through direct actions or indirect actions taken against them during recreational time inside their cell blocks unless said inmate has knowledge pertaining towards containment breaches outside our facilities via use of anomalous means or knowledge regarding how such anomalous objects work and/or operate within our facilities; leading MTF Omega 4 (<i>"Red Right Hand"</i>) agents assigned under Procedure 999 <i>"The Great Equalizer"</i> were dispatched onto site shortly afterwards whereupon they proceeded towards D - 6 2 0 3 's cell block while carrying assault rifles loaded with tranquilizer rounds ; ordering all inmates present into their cells before proceeding toward D - 62 03 's cell whereupon he was instructed via loudspeaker system not present on site beforehand not move until instructed otherwise upon which he complied before being shot twice once once each through both knees followed by two shots each through both wrists followed by two shots each through both ankles followed by five shots each through both elbows followed by four shots each through both shoulders followed by six shots each through his hips followed b y four more s hot s thr ough his chest cavity ending at his heart causing cardiac arrest resulting i n death due t o blood loss approximately ten minutes later<br><br><h3>Addendum 9936.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9936</i>, D-8791 (D-Class personnel)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-8791 was instructed to sit in a chair across from <i>SCP-9936</i>. The chair was then removed. After several minutes of silence, D-8791 became visibly distressed and began to beg for his life. SCP 9936 then shot D-8791 with its rifle, killing him instantly. It is unknown how SCP 9936 was able to use its rifle without the use of hands or other body parts that would normally be used for such an action.<br><br>Experiment #: 2<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>SCP 9936, Class D Personnel (D - 8793) . Both subjects were fitted with bulletproof vests prior to the experiment's start.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Both subjects were instructed to shake hands with each other while standing in front of a wall marked as 'ground zero'. After both subjects had shaken hands and returned their arms back by their sides, they were told to step away from each other until they reached ground zero. Upon reaching ground zero both subjects were shot by the opposing subject using live ammunition at point blank range causing instant death for both parties involved in the experiment .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Neither subject suffered any damage due to being shot at point blank range . Bullets fired by Subject 9936 did not penetrate through Subject 8793's vest but instead ricocheted off it and embedded themselves into the wall behind him . Bullets fired by Subject 8793 did not penetrate through Subject 9936's vest but instead ricocheted off it and embedded themselves into the opposite wall behind her . This shows that although she can be harmed physically , bullets do not harm her unless they are fired directly at her head or heart area , which is also where she can cause physical harm towards others as well..</div>
