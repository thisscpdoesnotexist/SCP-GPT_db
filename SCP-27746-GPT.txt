<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27746, dubbed "The Silence Scribe," is a sentient being comprised of a dark, viscous fluid with the ability to manipulate sound waves within a varying radius. Its core measures approximately 0.5m in diameter; however, its form can alter dramatically with no apparent limit to its range of extension or contraction. </p>
<p>SCP-27746 has demonstrated the capability to absorb all vibratory motion from its surroundings, effectively rendering areas around it completely devoid of sound, hence the moniker. This absorption creates a zone classified as a "Silent Field" wherein all traditional forms of vocal or instrumental sound generation are impossible. SCP-27746 appears to utilize absorbed sound to fuel its physical alterations and to "write" text on nearby surfaces. The script produced by SCP-27746 is composed of an unknown substance similar in appearance to its own corporeal form and has been found to exert a cognitohazardous effect on readers if not properly contained.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which SCP-27746 absorbs sound is not fully understood, but the effects are immediate and total within a radius that fluctuates between 2 and 200 meters. SCP-27746 has also shown intelligence and purpose in its actions, often targeting individuals or areas where significant sound is being produced.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to its ability to elude capture by becoming intangible and its hazardous influence on human cognition, SCP-27746 should be contained in a specially designed chamber at Site-██, with walls coated in a sound-dampening material to mitigate its power. The containment chamber must have no less than 5 meters of clearance in all directions beyond the variable "Silent Field" radius.</p>
<p>All communication and observation with SCP-27746 are to be conducted via non-vocal methods, such as written notes or gesture-based devices. Visual observation is to be carried out with high-frequency infrared cameras, as SCP-27746 appears less capable of absorbing non-audible wavelengths.</p>
<p>Containment chamber access is strictly forbidden without Level 4 clearance and a full cognitive hazard screening. In the event of a containment breach, Site-██ is to enter a state of silent lockdown with all personnel adhering to Communication Procedure Kappa-4, which involves non-sound based messaging systems.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>SCP-27746 was initially discovered in ██████, a small town which had inexplicably fallen silent overnight. Upon investigating the anomaly, Foundation agents found the entire population in a catatonic state with SCP-27746 at the epicenter. The Foundation was able to secure SCP-27746 after deploying a portable soundproof containment unit.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 27746-E01</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the range of SCP-27746's "Silent Field."</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Gradually introduced sound at increasing distances within the containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-27746 extended its Silent Field to 50 meters radius but did not exceed containment specifications.</p>
<h4>Experiment 27746-E02</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To test the cognitohazardous effects of the script written by SCP-27746.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-class personnel equipped with sound-dampening headphones were instructed to read text generated by SCP-27746.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject D-1129 experienced immediate and irreversible mutism followed by a progressive mental deterioration.</p>
<h4>Experiment 27746-E03</h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To test communication with SCP-27746.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A series of questions were written on a tablet and shown to SCP-27746.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-27746 responded by altering its form into symbols that mirrored human letters, though the meaning of most words remained uninterpretable.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Report 27746-A</h3>
<p>On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred when SCP-27746 managed to expand its Silent Field beyond the chamber, affecting a section of Site-██. During the 47 minutes before containment was reestablished, SCP-27746 produced a massive amount of cognitohazardous text along the Site's walls and floors. All personnel affected by the incident exhibited acute symptoms, including aphasia and ataxia, leading to several fatalities.</p>
<p>Post-incident analysis suggested that the breach was not arbitrary. A speech competition taking place nearby seemed to have acted as a beacon, "calling" SCP-27746 to absorb the sound. Containment procedures have since been updated to include the cancellation of all vocally-centric events within a ten-kilometer radius of Site-██.</p>
