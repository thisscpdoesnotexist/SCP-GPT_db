Upon ingestion of <i>SCP-18300</i>, the subject will experience a rapid increase in strength and physical endurance. However, this increase in strength comes at a cost; subjects exposed to <i>SCP-18300</i> will suffer from severe cognitive impairment, leading to impaired decision making and difficulty communicating effectively with others.<br><br>In addition to these effects, subjects exposed to <i>SCP-18300</i> may become highly aggressive and prone to violent outbursts. This aggression appears to be linked directly with the amount of <i>SCP-18300</i> ingested by the subject; as more is taken, their aggression becomes more pronounced.<br><br>It should be noted that any attempts at removing or neutralizing <i>SCP-18300</i> from within a subject have resulted in death due to cardiac arrest or other complications related to extreme physical exertion caused by the drug's effects.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18300</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-18300</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. Any personnel found attempting to access <i>SCP-18300</i> without proper authorization will be subject to disciplinary action.<br><br>In the event of an uncontrolled release of <i>SCP-18300</i>, all affected individuals are to be detained and monitored for any signs of cognitive impairment or aggression. If necessary, amnestics may be administered as per standard protocol.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18300.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of individuals attempted to use <i>SCP-18300</i> as a means of enhancing their physical strength in order to commit a robbery. All subjects were apprehended and detained by Foundation personnel before any damage could be done. Upon questioning, all subjects reported feeling <i>"stronger than ever"</i> but also admitted to having difficulty understanding basic concepts and communicating with others.<br><br>It is believed that this incident was the result of an individual attempting to sell <i>SCP-18300</i> on the black market; however, no further information has been obtained at this time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18300.2: </h3> Interview with D-18300-1<br><br>On ██/██/20██, D-18300-1 was administered a dose of <i>SCP-18300</i> and observed for changes in behavior. The following is an excerpt from the interview conducted with D-18300-1:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How do you feel?<br><b><br>D-18300-1:</b> I feel…strong. Like I could lift a car or something. But my head feels kind of fuzzy, like I can't think straight. It's hard to concentrate on anything for too long.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you feel any different emotionally?<br><b><br>D-18300-1:</b> Yeah, I'm kinda angry. Like, really angry. It's like my brain is telling me to do something destructive but I can't figure out what it is.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18300.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18300.3-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-18300-1, a male human aged 28.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was given a single dose of <i>SCP-18300</i> and instructed to perform various physical tasks such as lifting weights and running on a treadmill.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Subject exhibited increased strength and endurance, completing the tasks with ease. However, subject also began exhibiting signs of cognitive impairment, becoming increasingly agitated and difficult to communicate with. After approximately 20 minutes, subject became violent towards personnel present in the testing chamber before collapsing due to cardiac arrest. Autopsy revealed that <i>SCP-18300</i> had caused severe damage to the subject's cardiovascular system.</div>
