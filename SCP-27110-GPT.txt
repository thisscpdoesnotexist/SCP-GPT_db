    <center> <h3> SCP-27110 is  what really came first, before the chicken or the egg </h3> </center>
    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-27110</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27110 is an anomalous concept that manifests physical paradoxes and causal loops revolving around the metaphysical inquiry: "What came first, the chicken or the egg?" When an individual, henceforth designated the "subject," is exposed to SCP-27110 through auditory, visual, or cognitive means, the subject enters a state of confusion characterized by increasingly complex philosophical reasoning and obsession with solving the paradox.</p>
<p>This obsession progressively grows more acute, leading to insomnia, paranoia, and in some cases, reality-altering attempts to materially resolve the paradox. Affected subjects, who eventually fall under SCP-27110's full influence, are capable of spontaneously manifesting physical anomalies which embody the paradox itself. These manifestations can range from literal chicken/egg causality loops to more abstract constructs that threaten the fabric of reality by creating unsolvable temporal or spatial paradoxes.</p>
<p>SCP-27110's influence seems to extend to not just individual humans, but also to AI systems and collective human thought, potentially posing a risk of initiating a CK-Class restructuring scenario if left unchecked.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to the conceptual nature of SCP-27110, physical containment is impossible. Foundation web crawlers (AI-SCP-PROTOCOL-27110) are to monitor all forms of digital communication and flag conversations, content, or queries relating to the chicken/egg causality dilemma. Standard amnestic treatments are to be administered to affected individuals, along with the distribution of cover stories about sudden philosophical interests or psychological episodes, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Censorship of SCP-27110-related discussions in academic, scientific, and public domains is to be enforced subtly to prevent drawing attention to the anomaly. Personnel assigned to SCP-27110 are to receive mental conditioning to resist the compulsive effects of the anomaly and are not to engage with the concept outside of a professional capacity. Additionally, any manifestations originating from SCP-27110 are to be immediately contained, and the reality of their existence redacted from all possible records.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 27110-A</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-10425</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to the SCP-27110 paradox for five minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject displayed initial confusion, followed by an attempt to rationalize the paradox. After two hours, the subject became agitated and unresponsive to external stimuli.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject was administered Class-C amnestics and returned to normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment 27110-B</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> AI construct (Designation: AI-17X)</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> AI-17X was programmed to resolve SCP-27110.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> AI-17X entered a recursive loop and eventually shut down, issuing the statement, "Causality corrupted. Solution undefined."</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> AI-17X was decommissioned to prevent any potential reality-breaking outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment 27110-C</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-19827</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject exposed to SCP-27110 and observed over a period of seven days without intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> On day 3, the subject claimed to have solved the paradox but refused to elaborate. On day 6, a minor spatial anomaly was observed in the subject's cell, resulting in the disappearance of one chicken and the spontaneous generation of an egg.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject was moved to a high-security cell and is under constant observation for further anomaly manifestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Interview Log</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Emily Castor, Lead Researcher of SCP-27110</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Alan Everett, Senior Staff Interviewer</p>
<p>[Partial transcript for brevity]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Everett:</strong> "Dr. Castor, can you explain the implications of SCP-27110 manifesting physical paradoxes?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Castor:</strong> "Certainly. Every instance where the anomaly forces the chicken/egg situation to a head, we risk tearing a hole in causality. We've seen small breaches—an egg without a cause, a chicken without progeny—but our fear is a chain reaction causing large-scale disruption to what we perceive as reality."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Everett:</strong> "Do you believe there's a solution to SCP-27110?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Castor:</strong> "SCP-27110 isn't a riddle to be solved. It's a Gordian Knot in the fabric of causality. We're not aiming to cut through it; we're trying to ensure it doesn't unravel anything else along with it."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Everett:</strong> "What preventive measures can we take to mitigate these effects?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Castor:</strong> "Our best bet is understanding the limits and enforcing those boundaries. Knowledge is our containment here, thus the heightened monitoring and intervention procedures."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Everett:</strong> "Thank you, Dr. Castor. Let's hope we stay ahead of the anomaly."</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Log</h3>
<p>On ██/██/████, Researcher ██████ inadvertently mentioned SCP-27110 during a psychology lecture streamed online. The subsequent memetic outbreak resulted in the manifestation of multiple paradoxical entities across ████ different geographic locations. MTF-λλ ("Logic Bombers") was deployed to contain the situation.</p>
<p>Each entity appeared to be a chicken or an egg, existing in a perpetual state of flux between both states. It took approximately █ hours to neutralize all entities and administer mass amnestics. The researcher responsible has been subjected to re-education and disciplinary action as per Protocol 27110-D ("Eggshell Proceedings").</p>
<p><strong>Note from O5 Command:</strong> Failure to contain SCP-27110 exposition within hypothetical scenarios is unacceptable. Further slip-ups may result in the tightening of the Foundation's cognitive information security measures and strict reevaluation of personnel clearance levels for conceptual anomalies.</p></div>
