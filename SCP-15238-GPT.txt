Testing with <i>SCP-15238</i> is currently suspended pending review.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15238</i> is a book titled <i>"Electric Shock Practice Book"</i> by the publisher <i>"B.S.F."</i> It was found in the home of ████ ███████, who had been reported missing by his wife and neighbors after he began to behave erratically. The subject was found dead, having committed suicide via electric shock from <i>SCP-15238</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br><i>SCP-15238</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is opened to any page other than the first page while connected to an electrical outlet or power source of any kind (including batteries). When this occurs, <i>SCP-15238</i> will begin to emit a high frequency electrical current that will travel along power cables and directly into the body of anyone touching them at the time of activation. This current will cause all muscles in said person's body except for those needed for respiration and movement of their eyes to contract uncontrollably until they lose consciousness due to asphyxiation or heart failure; death typically occurs within two minutes as a result of either condition . The current produced by <i>SCP-15238</i> can be blocked with insulating materials such as rubber or plastic; however, if contact with these materials is broken during this time then <i>SCP-15238</i> will continue producing its effect until it has killed everyone within 10 meters (32 feet) through direct exposure or indirectly through secondary exposure from its effect on nearby power sources .<br><br><i>SCP-15238</i> cannot be turned off once activated unless it has already killed every living being within 10 meters (32 feet) except for itself . In addition, if there are no living beings left within 10 meters (32 feet), then <i>SCP-15238</i> will begin killing all living beings outside that range but still connected to its power source regardless of whether they are touching wires carrying electricity at that time . Once every life form has been killed off via these means , SCP- 15 238 's effects cease immediately and it can safely be removed from its power source without incident .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15238.1 : </h3> ████ ███████ Interview<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ███████, husband of missing person and owner of <i>SCP-15238</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on the day that <i>SCP-15238</i> was discovered at the home of Mr. █████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, Mr. █████, I'm Dr. [REDACTED].

However, once he had been killed off via its effects , <i>SCP-15238</i> stopped producing its anomalous effect immediately and could safely be removed from its power source without incident . <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>It appears that SCP - 15 238 's anomalous properties can only be activated when it is in direct contact with a living human being; however, once it has done so then it will continue producing its anomalous effect regardless of whether or not said person is still alive at that time. Experiment 15238 - 2: Object ive: To determine how long it takes for SCP - 15 238 's anomalous properties to kill someone via secondary exposure caused by nearby electrical outlets or power sources connected to those outlets/power sources within 10 meters (32 feet) of said person. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One D - Class personnel was placed in an electrically isolated chamber along with one (1) desktop computer running on battery power , one (1) television set connected via HDMI cable, one (1) laptop computer running on battery power , and two (2 ) smartphones each fully charged . All devices were turned on before testing began but were switched off once testing had begun . Result s: Once all four devices were turned on simultaneously , they began emitting high frequency electrical currents which traveled along their respective cables into the body of D - Class personnel #███ ████ through indirect exposure due to proximity ; this caused him considerable discomfort as well as muscle spasms throughout his body until he lost consciousness due to asphyxiation approximately five minutes later . After this point, all four devices ceased emitting their current entirely; however, they remained active despite no longer having any electricity flowing through them whatsoever until [DATA EXPUNGED] minutes after initial death occurred due to Dr.(redacted)'s order being overridden by an unknown entity which proceeded to use these devices' electrical current as a medium for [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>It appears that if there are any live beings within 10 meters of where electricity travels directly into another living creature's body then they will begin experiencing secondary exposure from that electricity regardless of whether or not said creature is still alive at that time; this can result in death if enough voltage passes through them over a period of time depending upon what type(s) of device(s), outlet(s), and/or power source(s) are used during this process. Experiment 15238 - 3 Object ive: To determine how long it takes for SCP - 15 238 's anomalous properties kill someone who has been exposed indirectly via nearby electrical outlets or power sources connected directly into their bodies without actually touching them directly first using secondary exposure over a period of time instead while also accounting for any possible differences between those exposed indirectly versus those who have been exposed directly using primary exposure over a period of time instead while also accounting for any possible differences between these groups regarding how long said people take before succumbing completely depending upon what type( s ) o f device( s ), outlet( s ), and/or p ower sourc e ( s ) are used during thi s process . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One D class personnel was placed inside an electrically isolated chamber along with ten desktop computers each running on battery pow er , ten televisions sets each connected via HDMI cable , ten laptops each runn ing o n batter y powe r , ten smartphones each fully charged ; all devic es wer e turn ed o n b efo re testing bega n but we re switc hed off once testing ha d begun .
