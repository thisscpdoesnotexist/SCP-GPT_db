The locker should be checked daily for any signs of tampering and the worms inside <i>SCP-17093</i> should be monitored regularly to ensure that they remain contained.<br><br>In the event of a containment breach, personnel are to immediately report it and take appropriate measures to contain the worms. If necessary, Class B amnestics may be administered as needed.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17093</i> is a standard 12 oz can of worms, with the brand name “Fisherman’s Delight”. The can appears to be in perfect condition, however, upon opening it reveals that it is filled with an unknown species of worm.<br><br>The worms contained within <i>SCP-17093</i> are capable of locomotion and have been observed to move around inside the can as if searching for something. Upon further investigation, it has been found that these worms possess an advanced form of intelligence and are able to communicate with each other through various vocalizations and body language.<br><br>When exposed to certain stimuli such as sound or light, the worms will become agitated and attempt to escape their confinement by any means necessary. If successful in escaping from their container they will immediately seek out dark confined spaces where they will remain until disturbed again by external stimulus.<br><br>Due to its anomalous properties <i>SCP-17093</i> must be kept in a secure containment locker at all times when not being tested on or observed by personnel trained specifically for this purpose. Any personnel attempting unauthorized access into the containment locker containing <i>SCP-17093</i> should be reported immediately and reprimanded accordingly<br><br><h3>Addendum 17093.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was sent to investigate the origin of <i>SCP-17093</i>. After extensive searching and interviews with local fishermen, it was determined that <i>SCP-17093</i> originated from an abandoned fishing trawler off the coast of ██████. The vessel had been reported missing for over two months prior to its discovery by Foundation personnel.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17093.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was sent to investigate the origin of <i>SCP-17093</i>. After extensive searching and interviews with local fishermen, it was determined that the can had been found on board an abandoned fishing trawler off the coast of ██████. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the vessel had belonged to a man by the name of ████████.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Mr. ████████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good afternoon Mr. ████████, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today about your experience with <i>SCP-17093</i>. Could you tell us what happened?<br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Well… I was out on my boat one day fishing when I noticed something strange in the water near me… It looked like a can floating there so I decided to take a closer look and see what it was… When I got close enough I could see that it wasn’t just any old can – there were worms inside! They were wriggling around and making all sorts of noise… It freaked me out at first but then curiosity got the better of me so I scooped them up in my net and brought them back home with me on my boat… That’s when things started getting really weird…<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What do you mean by “weird”?<br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Well for starters, they seemed smarter than regular worms – like they knew what we were saying or something! And then one night while we were sleeping they escaped from their container and started running all over our house! We chased them down eventually but ever since then things have been different around here….<br><br><h3>Addendum 17093.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #1: <i>SCP-17093</i> was exposed to a loud noise (100 dB) for 15 seconds. The worms reacted by attempting to escape from their confinement, but were unable to do so due to the secure containment locker.<br><br><b>Result: </b>The worms became agitated and attempted to escape their confinement, but were unsuccessful.</div>
