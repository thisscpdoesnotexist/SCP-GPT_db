When asked about his reasoning for using <i>SCP-10398</i>, Mr. ██████ claimed he needed it because <i>"those things"</i> were everywhere and he needed to be able to protect himself from them. Upon further interrogation about what <i>"things"</i> he was referring to, Mr. ██████ replied <br><br><b>with: </b><i>"The things that hide in the shadows."</i> An investigation into Mr. ██████'s home revealed multiple dead animals and human beings scattered throughout his house as well as several books on witchcraft and occult practices .

You mean the ones that hide in the shadows? Yeah, they're real alright! They're everywhere! Dr. ███: Could you please elaborate on what these creatures are exactly? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>I don't know much about them other than they come out at night and try to get me . They can't stand sunlight so as soon as night falls they come out of their hiding spots and try to kill me . It's pretty scary sometimes but I always manage to stay one step ahead of them by using my glasses so I can see where they are hiding before it is too late . Dr.: And do you know where these creatures came from or why they are trying to kill you? Mr.: Not really… but I think it has something do with those books over there . [Mr.] points towards a stack of books next to him on his bedside table . The top book has a black cover with a pentagram drawn on it in red ink while the rest have similar covers but also contain titles such as <i>"The Necronomicon"</i> , <i>"The Satanic Bible"</i> , <i>"The Black Book Of Satanism"</i> , etc … [Mr.] <br><br><b>continues: </b>Those books were given to me by some guy who told me he could teach me how use my powers for good instead of evil…but he never showed up again after that first meeting so now all those things want revenge for him betraying them…and now they want revenge on me too because he was supposed help protect us from them..I don't even know why we had this meeting in the first place since he never showed up again or anything like that …Dr.: Thank you for your time sir; we'll be taking those books now if that's okay with you ..
