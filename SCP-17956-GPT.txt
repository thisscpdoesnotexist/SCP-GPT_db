<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17956 is  bird school, which is for birds</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17956<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17956</i> is a large aviary located in █████, ████. The aviary consists of four main sections, each with its own entrance and exit. Each section contains various plants, trees and shrubs as well as several bird houses and perches.<br><br>The anomalous property of <i>SCP-17956</i> is that it appears to be populated by birds that have been trained to perform basic tasks such as fetching objects or responding to simple commands. These birds are all of the same species (Corvus corax) but their coloration varies greatly between individuals.<br><br>When any human enters one of the four sections, they will be greeted by one or more birds who will offer them an object - typically a seed or piece of fruit - which they must accept before being allowed to proceed further into the aviary. If the human does not accept this offering within two minutes then all birds in the area will begin attacking them until they leave or are incapacitated.<br><br>Once inside, humans are able to observe various activities taking place among the bird population including teaching sessions where younger birds learn new skills from older ones, group flights around certain areas of the aviary and even occasional mock battles between different groups for territory disputes. It should also be noted that these activities appear to occur regardless if there are any humans present or not.<br><br>In addition to these activities, it has been observed that some individuals within <i>SCP-17956</i> possess advanced intelligence beyond what would normally be expected from their species; most notably being able to communicate with humans using simple words and phrases in order understand instructions given by researchers during testing procedures conducted on site at times when personnel were available for observation purposes only..<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17956</i> is to be kept in a secure aviary at Site-██. Access to the aviary is restricted and all personnel entering must be accompanied by at least one Level 3 or higher researcher.<br><br>Personnel are not allowed to interact with any of the birds inside <i>SCP-17956</i> without prior approval from the Site Director. Any attempts to do so will result in disciplinary action being taken against those responsible.<br><br>In order to prevent any further spread of anomalous properties, no birds are allowed to leave <i>SCP-17956</i> under any circumstances and all visitors must be thoroughly searched for contraband before leaving the premises.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17956.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a specimen of Corvus corax was observed to be carrying a small piece of paper with the words <i>"Help me"</i> written on it. Further investigation is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17956.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17956</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was sent to <i>SCP-17956</i> in order to interview one of the birds. The bird chosen for this purpose was an adult male Corvus corax with white feathers and blue eyes. It is believed that this individual has been living in <i>SCP-17956</i> since its containment.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell me your name?<br><b><br>Bird:</b> My name is [REDACTED].<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How long have you been living here?<br><b><br>Bird:</b> I have been here for a very long time. I cannot remember how many years it has been.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What do you do here?<br><b><br>Bird:</b> I teach the younger birds how to fly and hunt. We also have competitions to see who can find food the fastest or build the best nest.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you like living here?<br><b><br>Bird:</b> Yes, I do. It is a safe and comfortable place to live.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17956.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/██<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17956</i>-A (an adult Corvus corax)<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to retrieve an object from outside the aviary and bring it back inside.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Subject successfully retrieved the object and brought it back inside without incident.</div>
