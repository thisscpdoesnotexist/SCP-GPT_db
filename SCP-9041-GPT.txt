He has been previously denied the following:<br><br>1.) A proper table and chair, as well as a computer to write his SCP articles on.<br><br>2.) To have his limbs removed from the shoulder down and replaced with robotic limbs. He argues that this would make him more efficient in writing SCP articles, as well as improve his social skills.(See Addendum 9041a)<br><br>3.) To receive two (2) D class personnel for sexual intercourse weekly.(See Addendum 9041b) The request was granted for one week only due to the nature of the request being deemed inappropriate by staff members, including Dr ██████. It was later determined that it may have been part of a psychological experiment meant to gauge staff reactions towards sexual requests made by an anomalous object via documenting their reactions towards such requests being carried out against their will or not being carried out at all. In addition it was discovered that through some form of unknown means <i>SCP-9041</i> had managed to record video footage of various staff members attempting coitus with D Class Personnel under the guise of an interview regarding their views on sexuality while also using various forms or coercion ranging from threats against them or their families if they refused intercourse with said D Class Personnel all the way up until physical force used on<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9041</i> is a 64 year old Caucasian male. He is 1.8m tall and weighs 76kg, with poor muscle definition. <i>SCP-9041</i> has black hair that is balding, grey eyes and an IQ of 153.<br><br><i>SCP-9041</i> has an obsession with writing SCPs despite having no formal education regarding the subject outside of his degree in English literature which he earned ██ years prior to his abduction by The Black Dragon Society (BDS). <i>SCP-9041</i> also suffers from extreme clinical depression, citing the cause as being caused by <i>"family issues"</i>. Despite this it appears that <i>SCP-9361</i> has had some form of past relationship with the BDS due to him claiming to have been abducted by them twice prior to his first containment date at Site-██ on ██/██/████, though whether or not this was true was never established due to lack of evidence pertaining to such claims despite thorough searches via electronic means as well as physical search parties within 20km radius around Dr ██████'s home were he lives in ██████████, Canada.. His second abduction came on ██/██/20██ when he claimed that he was abducted once again after sending out several job applications including ones pertaining to employment at GOC facilities under false pretenses.(See Addendum 9042a) He has since then attempted escape on several occasions but all attempts have failed due to him being under constant surveillance via both CCTV cameras and two (2) guards who are stationed outside his cell twenty four seven.(See Addendum 9042b)<br><br><i>SCP-9041</i> shows symptoms very similar if not identical too those associated with severe cases of schizophrenia including delusions regarding himself being a writer for said organization despite having little experience in writing articles about anomalous objects before entering the Foundation's employment which could be explained away via him having possibly gained knowledge about writing said articles online or possibly through research into various anomalous objects kept within Foundation custody though no concrete proof could be found either way.(See Addendum 9042c) Whether or not these symptoms are genuine mental illness symptoms suffered by <i>SCP-0941</i> are still up for debate amongst staff members working close proximity towards him though it should be noted that most staff members who work closely towards investigating or observing said symptoms suffer from headaches accompanied by nausea followed shortly after wards by vomiting leading many staff members stationed around SCP 9041's cell deemed <i>"incapacitated"</i> until they can recover fully from said symptoms which usually take<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9041</i> was recovered on ██/██/████ after a Foundation affiliated group known as the Black Dragon Society sent a letter to Site-██ claiming that they had captured an important member of the organization and were demanding a ransom of one hundred thousand dollars in exchange for his release. The letter had been written by <i>SCP-9041</i> himself, who claimed that he could have easily escaped but decided to stay in order to <i>"fulfill his promise"</i> to his comrades. Given that there was no proof either way whether or not this claim was true given the fact that there were no videos or photos taken at any point during <i>SCP-9041</i>'s capture nor has anyone come forward claiming responsibility for capturing him thus far making it impossible for confirmation.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9041.1 :</h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-9041</i> had requested that he be allowed to have his limbs removed in order to replace them with robotic appendages.<br><br>Note from Dr. ██████: Due to the nature of this request it is hereby denied by order of O5-██. -Dr ██████<br><br>Request denied 8-0 by the council<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9041.2 :</h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-9041</i> then requested that he be given two (2) D Class Personnel for intercourse weekly in order to <i>"improve his social skills."</i><br><br>Note from Dr. ██████: The request is denied again by order of O5-██.<br><br>Request denied 8-0 by the council<br><br></div>
