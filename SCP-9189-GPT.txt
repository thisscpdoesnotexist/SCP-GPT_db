The range of this effect is currently unknown, but testing has shown that if the object is completely submerged in water then its effect will cease. It appears that <i>SCP-9189</i> uses an unidentified form of energy to do this, as it does not require permission from anyone for use (see incident report 9189-1).<br><br>The Foundation was alerted to SCP when reports came in about a family who were hurt by their television falling on top of them and crushing them. An investigation into this anomaly led Foundation agents to discover both <i>SCP-9179</i> and 9179's creators inside a room in [DATA EXPUNGED]. The agents were able to capture both objects before they could be moved elsewhere by [REDACTED], who claimed he would give them away at a later date due to him being <i>"tired"</i>.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9189</i> was found in [DATA EXPUNGED] after reports of a family being hurt by their television falling on top of them, crushing them to death.<br><br><br>Recovery Log:<br><br><h3>Addendum 9189.1 :</h3> Testing Log<br><br><br>Test #: 1<br><br><br>Subject: One D-Class personnel.<br><br><br>Procedure: Subject was placed in a room with <i>SCP-9189</i>, then told to pick up the object. The subject was then instructed to throw it at the wall. The effect of this is currently unknown, as D-Class personnel ████ has not been seen since being put into testing chamber, and no corpse has been recovered from the walls or floor of the chamber.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9189.2 :</h3> Incident Report 9189-1<br><br><br>Incident Report 9189-1: On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-9179</i> was used to test the capabilities of <i>SCP-9189</i>. It was found that when immersed in water completely, its effect ceased. The subject who had been testing with it at the time, Agent ██████, had drowned in the water produced by <i>SCP-9179</i> while on a break and was presumed to have died by drowning.</div>
