How are you, today? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9986</i>: </b>I'm doing well! I got a new saddle yesterday! It's so comfy! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>That's good to hear. Now, I have a few questions to ask you about your past and how you came to be here at the Foundation. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9986</i>: </b>Okay! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>Where did you come from? You don't look like any horse we've ever seen before… <br><br><b><i>SCP-9986</i>: </b>I was born in Ireland about three years ago, but my mom died when she gave birth to me because she was too long for her body to handle giving birth… Or so my dad told me anyway… He said that he found me in the woods after he heard my mom screaming while giving birth and that he took care of me until I grew up enough for him to ride on my back… He said that one day we were out riding together when some people approached us and asked if they could buy me off of him since no one had ever seen anything like me before in their lives and they wanted proof of what they saw with their own eyes… They offered him enough money for both of us so we went with them but then they took us both away from each other without letting us say goodbye or anything like that… And then after a while we ended up here at the Foundation where all this mess started happening.. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>Thank you for your time, 9986 . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 9986.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9986<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9986 was to be sent into <i>SCP-9986</i>'s pen, and told to approach it.
