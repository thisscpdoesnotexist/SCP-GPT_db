<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-36584 refers to a series of animated episodes, each approximately 22 minutes in length, that are anomalous variations of the children's television show <em>Bunnicula</em>, which aired during the early 2000s. The show in its non-anomalous form depicts the adventures of a vampire rabbit named Bunnicula who lives with his owner Mina and her two pets, a cat named Chester, and a dog named Harold; however, SCP-36584's content significantly diverges from the standard episodes.</p>
<p>When viewed, SCP-36584 episodes induce a range of emotions in the audience from mild discomfort to existential dread. The episodes feature surreal and often disturbing imagery not present in the source material. Characters often break the fourth wall, addressing the viewers directly and discussing concepts outside the scope of a typical children's cartoon, including mortality, the nature of reality, and the concept of an audience's gaze as an existential burden.</p>
<p>Viewers affected by SCP-36584 report being unable to change the channel, pause, or stop playback until the episode concludes. Abnormal psychological effects persist for up to 72 hours after viewing, including paranoia, a sense of being watched, and vivid nightmares featuring the animated characters.</p>
<p>No physical copies of SCP-36584 episodes exist; they are only encountered as broadcasts on obscure, defunct channels or as unauthorized streams on lesser-known video platforms.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>All known instances of SCP-36584 broadcasts have been intercepted and suppressed by Foundation web crawler AI, codenamed "Caldecott". Remaining physical and digital copies of SCP-36584 episodes are contained in a secure, air-gapped hard drive within a standard containment locker at Site-77. Access to these materials is restricted to personnel with security clearance level 3 or higher who have undergone mandatory psychological evaluation.</p>
<p>Any potential broadcasts or streaming of SCP-36584 that evade "Caldecott" are to be traced to their source and the responsible parties are to be detained for questioning. Amnestics may be administered as required. The global broadcasting community and major streaming service providers are to be monitored for any sign of SCP-36584 transmissions. Embedded agents within these organizations are to use any means necessary to halt the spread of the anomaly.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Episode Summary</h3>
<h4>Addendum 1-A: SCP-36584-1 - "The Eternal Carrot"</h4>
<p>An episode wherein Bunnicula pursues a carrot through various shifting landscapes. As the chase progresses, the surroundings become more abstract and Bunnicula exhibits an increasingly frantic behavior. The carrot speaks in riddles about time and death, implying Bunnicula's pursuit is meaningless.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Incident Log</h3>
<h4>Addendum 2-A: Incident 36584-A</h4>
<p>On February 14, 20██, a mass outbreak of SCP-36584 was observed as it aired simultaneously in multiple locations around the world. Affected viewers called emergency services, reporting experiences of hallucinations and existential crises. Mobile Task Force Psi-8 ("The Silencers") was deployed to contain the situation. Amnestics were distributed on a large scale and a cover story about a "hacking prank" was disseminated to the media.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Interviews and Psychological Profiles</h3>
<h4>Addendum 3-A: Interview with Affected Viewer</h4>
<p>An interview conducted with a viewer post-exposure to SCP-36584-1. The individual expresses profound unease and repeatedly questions the nature of their own existence, suggesting a lasting cognitive impact.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Addendum 4-A: Experiment 36584-03</h4>
<p>D-class personnel were instructed to watch SCP-36584-1, followed by a controlled interview. Subjects showcased a dramatic shift in behavior, with some refusing to engage with any media content afterward, whereas others became obsessed with deciphering the riddles spoken by the carrot character.</p>
<h4>Addendum 4-B: Experiment 36584-07</h4>
<p>An attempt to broadcast SCP-36584 to a contained group of D-class subjects with prior exposure to other memetic anomalies. The experiment sought to observe any potential memetic resistance. Results were inconsistent, suggesting SCP-36584's effect bypasses conventional memetic defense mechanisms.</p>
