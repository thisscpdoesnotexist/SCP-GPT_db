They are not to be allowed access to any electronic devices or other means of communication with the outside world.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10487</i> is a memetic hazard that affects humans. <i>SCP-10487</i> is an image of a human face with the caption <i>"<i>SCP-10487</i>"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-10487</i>'s primary effect manifests when a human witnesses it. After being exposed to <i>SCP-10487</i>, the subject will become obsessed with it and begin to search for information about it. The subject will also attempt to spread information about <i>SCP-10487</i> using any means possible, including social media and physical contact. If the subject comes into contact with someone who has already been affected by <i>SCP-10487</i>, they will be infected as well.<br><br>The secondary effect of <i>SCP-10487</i> occurs when two or more people have been infected by it at once; this effect has only occurred in Foundation custody so far. When two or more subjects are exposed to each other at once, they will experience extreme pain and possibly death as their bodies begin to merge together in various ways until they form one entity composed of all subjects involved (designated <i>SCP-104871</i>). It is unknown if there is a limit on how many people can be merged together in this way; testing has not been conducted due to ethical concerns regarding human experimentation . Following this event, subjects will no longer exhibit anomalous properties; however, their consciousnesses remain intact within the entity. The entity formed from multiple merged instances of <i>SCP-102771</i> are designated instances of 104871a through 104871z . Instances are capable of speech and have displayed knowledge regarding both individual instances' former lives as well as general knowledge regarding humanity (including historical events such as World War II , [REDACTED] etc.). They also retain memories from before merging occurred but do not seem able to access them without prompting from researchers . These entities claim that merging was their original purpose but cannot provide details beyond that point ; however , research into recovered documents indicate that [DATA EXPUNGED]. This process appears irreversible unless one instance dies before another merges with them; if an instance dies after merging occurs but before another merges with them then all other instances die shortly thereafter . All attempts made thus far have failed due to [DATA EXPUNGED].

How are you feeling today? <br><br><b><i>SCP-104871</i>a: </b>I feel fine, thank you for asking! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>That's good to hear, but how do you feel about your current situation? You've been in containment for quite some time now . <br><br><b><i>SCP-104871</i>a: </b>Well , I'm not happy about it , but I understand that we were a danger to the world and needed to be stopped . But now that we're here , why can't we just be allowed to live our lives ? We've done nothing wrong ! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>And what do you say when people ask where your bodies went after merging ? Or why they can't find any records of your existence before this point ? Or how exactly one person could have so many different birthdays and ages on their death certificates ?

They were then told to discuss any thoughts or feelings regarding the objects. After this, they were asked to read the list again and talk about any changes in their thoughts or feelings regarding the items on the list. The experiment was conducted with one subject at a time; subjects were not allowed to communicate with each other until after all three had been exposed to <i>SCP-10487</i> individually . <br><br><b>Results: </b>All three subjects expressed disgust upon reading <i>SCP-096</i>'s entry on the first pass; however , none of them could recall why it disturbed them so much when questioned later . On their second pass through the list , all three subjects expressed curiosity regarding <i>SCP-096</i> and wanted more information about it; however , they still refused to enter its containment chamber when prompted by researchers . All three also expressed minor discomfort upon reading <i>SCP-105</i>'s entry during this second pass but refused further questioning as well .
