<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21003 is  the hotel that breaks your heart</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21003<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21003</i> is a large hotel located in ████████, Texas. The exterior of the building appears to be a standard three-story building constructed in the late 19th century, but the interior has been modified and expanded since then.<br><br>The anomalous effect of <i>SCP-21003</i> manifests when an individual enters any room within it. Upon entering the room, they will experience intense feelings of sadness, regret and despair that can last for up to 24 hours after leaving the premises. These feelings are not limited to those who have stayed at <i>SCP-21003</i> before; even first time visitors can be affected by this anomaly.<br><br>Additionally, any attempts to modify or alter any part of <i>SCP-21003</i>’s interior will fail due to unknown forces preventing such changes from occurring. Any attempts made will result in minor structural damage that must be repaired immediately or else further damage may occur.<br><br>Attempts at studying this phenomena have proven difficult as no one has yet been able to remain inside long enough without being affected by its anomalous properties.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21003</i> is to be monitored at all times by a team of Foundation personnel. Any visitors to the premises are to be immediately removed and administered Class-A amnestics.<br><br>Any attempts to modify or alter any part of <i>SCP-21003</i>’s interior must be approved by the Site Director before being attempted. All repairs must also be done under the supervision of Foundation personnel in order to prevent further damage from occurring.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21003.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a Foundation agent was sent to investigate <i>SCP-21003</i>. After entering the premises, they reported experiencing intense feelings of sadness and regret that lasted for several hours after leaving the building.

No other information could be gathered from this incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21003.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21003</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation agent was sent to <i>SCP-21003</i> in order to attempt an interview with the hotel. The following is a transcript of the conversation that occurred:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> “Hello, I’m here to ask you some questions about your anomalous properties.”<br><b><br><i>SCP-21003</i>:</b> “What do you want to know?”<br><b><br>Agent:</b> “Why does anyone who enters your premises experience intense feelings of sadness and regret?”<br><b><br><i>SCP-21003</i>:</b> “It is because this place has seen too much pain and sorrow over its lifetime. It has been witness to many broken hearts and shattered dreams. It is the pain of those who have stayed here that lingers in this place, and it will continue to do so until someone is able to break the cycle.”<br><br><h3> Addendum 21003.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><br>Test A - ██/██/20██<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-4138, a 32 year old male.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-21003</i> and remain inside for one hour.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After approximately 15 minutes, subject began to exhibit signs of distress such as crying and shaking.
