The room is to be furnished with a bed, toilet and sink. <i>SCP-14492</i>'s cell must be monitored at all times by two (2) armed guards . In the event of an attack, guards are instructed to use lethal force against <i>SCP-14492</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-14492</i> is not allowed any objects that could potentially aid in its escape or allow it to alter its appearance further than it already can . It has shown no interest in attempting escape and will remain motionless for extended periods of time before disappearing completely from sight; this effect seems limited within Site 17's walls and does not extend beyond them . <i>SCP-14492</i> also appears<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14492</i> is an entity which can be described as a tall, humanoid figure wearing a black suit. It is capable of altering its appearance to fit the expectations of those who view it, though it will always remain faceless.<br><br><i>SCP-14492</i> was first discovered in ██████, Ohio on ██/██/19██ when several residents reported sightings of <i>"the Slenderman"</i> after an attack on two children in the woods near their homes. The Foundation was alerted and Agents were dispatched to investigate. <i>SCP-14492</i> was found during a search of the area and captured without incident. It has been contained at Site-17 since then.<br><br><i>SCP-14492</i> has shown no signs of aggression while under containment but will react violently if provoked or otherwise threatened. Its primary method of attack is through telepathic suggestion, which can result in death or severe mental trauma if resisted for too long (see Addendum 14492-1). If left alone <i>SCP-14492</i> will remain motionless for extended periods before disappearing completely from sight; this effect seems to be limited to within Site 17's walls and does not extend beyond them . <i>SCP-14492</i> also appears able to teleport short distances within its cell with no apparent effort . This event typically coincides with a sharp drop in temperature inside its containment chamber . While these abilities have yet to be fully tested , they appear similar in nature to those exhibited by other known instances of SCP classification Keter .

It's always morning here. I don't think you understand just how long I've been in this cell, doctor. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please answer the questions as best you can, 14492; we're trying to help you here . <br><br><b><i>SCP-14492</i>: </b>You can't help me; no one can help me now . You see…I'm not really a person anymore… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please explain what you mean by that statement . <i>SCP-14492</i> pauses for several seconds before responding with a slight smile on its face . <br><br><b><i>SCP-14492</i>: </b>What do you think I mean? Look at me! Look at what they've done to me! I'm not even human anymore! That's why they locked me up here in this cell and threw away the key …and that's why they won't let anyone else see me…they don't want anyone else to know what happened to me…they don't want anyone else to become like this ! (SCP- 1449 2 begins sobbing uncontrollably) <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>We'll continue this later if need be , but first tell us about yourself and how you got like this , if it isn't too painful for you ? (SCP -1 4 492 nods its head): Ok then …what is your name ? Where were yo u born ? How old are y ou ?<br><br>SCP -1 4 492: My name is Stanley Thompson , but my friends called m e Stan back when there were still people around who would talk t o m e …I was born in [DATA EXPUNGED] Ohio on [REDACTED] and turned 19 years old last May 29th …Dr . W ormwood told m e that he found out about m e from my parents who contacted him after seeing thos e news reports about the Slenderman attack s last year ; he said he wanted t o study m e because of my connection with it an d asked them t o give him permission t o take care of things so nobody would find out abou t it ; he said h e'd make sure everything wou ld be alright if they did that….he lied….he lied all along ! (SCP -1 4 492 becomes hysterical again )<br><br>Dr . W <br><br><b>ormwood: </b>Who is Doctor Wormwood? Why did he contact your parents? What does <i>"Slenderman"</i> have anything to do with any of this?<br><br>SCP -1 4 492 stops crying and looks directly into the camera; his face has changed significantly since the beginning of the interview; his eyes are now completely black without pupils or irises and his skin appears pale white with red veins showing through it under a thin layer of epidermis which seems almost translucent in appearance<br><br>(At this point Agent Denton , who had been standing guard outside during the interview, enters and points his gun at SCP - 1 4 492 ) Agent <br><br><b>Denton: </b>Don 't move any closer ! Get away from him! He' s dangerous ! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At approximately 0900 hours local time Agents Denton & Richards entered containment chamber armed with high caliber rifles while Agents Smith & Jones provided cover fire from behind ballistic glass windows leading into chamber room via hallways adjacent containment room door entrance points due to concern over possibility of teleportation abilities exhibited by subject during previous interviews as well as discovery agent body cameras had ceased functioning upon entering chamber room despite showing no signs of malfunction prior entering same indicating possible anomalous properties associated subject which may have contributed towards cause death agents mentioned above although exact details remain unclear due further investigation required<br><br><h3>Addendum 14492.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment 14492-01 - Close Experiment <br><br><b>14492-01: </b>D-14492 is instructed to approach <i>SCP-14492</i>. D-14492 complies, and upon reaching a distance of approximately three (3) meters from <i>SCP-14492</i>, begins to tremble and back away from it. <br><br><b>D-14482: </b>I don't want to do this anymore… please let me go… (D-14482 continues pleading until the end of the experiment.) <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-14494</i>'s telepathic abilities are limited in range. Further testing will be required to determine how far this range extends .<br><br>+ Experiment 14492 -02 - Close Experiment 14492 - 02: D - 144 92 is instructed to approach SCP - 1 4 49 2 again . Upon reaching a distance of approximately three ( 3 ) meters , he turns towards the researcher observing him and begins screaming incoherently before falling silent and collapsing on the floor . He was later determined dead by cardiac arrest , though no physical trauma could be found on his body or any other cause for his death could be identified . <br><br><b>Notes: </b>While not directly attacked , it appears that prolonged exposure can result in death or severe mental trauma as a result of SCP – 1 4 49 2 's telepathic abilities . Further testing will be required if we are ever able to successfully capture another instance of Keter class entity for research purposes.</div>
