Any unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9012-GPT</i> is a credit card that has never been used. The value of the card is always $1,500 , it never runs out. It can be used at any store or business that accepts credit cards. If the amount of money on the SCP reaches $0, it will increase back to $1,500 and then stop decreasing from there until used again.<br><br>If the SCP is lost or stolen, then anyone who finds it can use it for anything they want . All transaction history will be erased after each use. When using <i>SCP-9012-GPT</i> at a store/business , all employees working there will act as if you are buying something for free even though you're not paying for anything . They will also act like they know you personally (if applicable) , even though they do not know who you are unless told otherwise<br><br><h5>SCP-9012 was discovered in ██████ ████ after reports of missing persons started appearing in local newspapers . Foundation agents were sent to investigate these claims and found several people missing with signs that read "Missing: [Name] Last Seen: [Date] Location:</h5> [Store Name]". Agents investigated this claim and discovered many people missing from different stores located around ██████ ████ with this same sign attached to them . Agent ███████ was sent to investigate one of these stores and found no indication of this happening except when he entered the restroom where an employee reported seeing someone go into one particular stall but when asked about details she could only say "I saw him go into a stall" and refused to elaborate further thinking Agent ███████ was some "pervert" trying back into stalls hoping someone would see him<br><br><h5>Recovery: SCP-9012 was found in a stall that had been broken into. SCP-9012 was found laying on the floor of the stall and Agent ███████ tried to pick it up but nothing came out which caused him to believe it was just some random credit card from some company. He tried using it at a nearby store to buy something for his wife and when he did so the cashier said "Hello Mr [REDACTED] , what can I get you today?" without any indication that she knew who he or his wife were . Agent ███████ became distressed by this and reported back to site ██. An investigation of the store revealed many signs about missing people from all over with writing on them reading "Missing: [Name] Last Seen: [Date] Location:</h5> [Store Name]" . All employees working there denied finding these signs, claiming they had always been there despite multiple reports of their discovery made earlier in this day<br><br><h5>Discovery:</h5> Over time, more stores were discovered with similar reports such as a bus stop by a local church where every single passenger onboard disappeared into thin air when arriving at their destination but no one noticed anything strange except for an old couple who mentioned seeing someone walk too close to the bus before everything went black around them . The driver claimed he never stopped so no one could get off though they didn't want too anyways<br><br><h5>The story behind SCP-9012 is as follows :</h5> A man named Bill Brown got fired from his job after spending all day at work watching porn on his phone instead of doing actual work (Including updates he should have completed) . He then went off in rage killing everyone in sight until police arrived and shot him several times only stopping him when he fell onto an electric fence outside a bank. The police took away Bill's body where upon inspection revealed cuts along Bill's wrists showing that Bill attempted suicide several times before succeeding but yet failed due to living right next door to an electrical substation where if you touch two metal rods together it creates enough electricity needed for you die even if you're not touching those metal rods directly(This discovery can be used against anyone using SCP-500). After learning about all this, foundation agents took custody of Bills corpse after making up some story about missing people being connected with Bills death via autopsy results (not possible because autopsies do not show cause of death) They then brought him back alive at site ██ where they used D-Class personnel assigned as janitors/lab assistants/dietary staffs etc…etc…to keep tabs on him via security camera while keeping most information about what happened under wraps (He doesn't know why everyone hates him or thinks hes dead)<br><br><h5>Addendum 9012.1:</h5> Interview<br><br><h5>Interviewed: SCP-9012 Interviewer: Dr. ██████ <Begin Log> Dr. ██████: Good Morning, SCP-9012 SCP-9012: Hello there, how are you?
