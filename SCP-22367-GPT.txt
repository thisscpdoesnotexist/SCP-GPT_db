Its feathers are black with white stripes along its underside.<br><br><i>SCP-22367</i> has several anomalous abilities, including the ability to manipulate matter on a subatomic level, allowing it to create and control objects as well as alter its own form. It can also generate energy fields which allow it to interact with electronic devices and other forms of technology. Additionally, <i>SCP-22367</i> can communicate telepathically with other sapient beings within close proximity.<br><br><i>SCP-22367</i> displays sapience and intelligence far beyond that of any known species of penguin or bird in general; it has displayed knowledge on multiple scientific topics such as quantum physics, engineering, mathematics, chemistry and biology among others. It also speaks multiple languages fluently including English, Spanish and German.<br><br>Due to its anomalous properties and capabilities <i>SCP-22367</i> has been classified as Thaumiel by the Foundation due to its potential use in various research projects related to advanced sciences such as quantum computing or nanotechnology development.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-22367</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a variety of scientific equipment and materials for use in research projects. Access to the chamber must be restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential misuse of its anomalous abilities, <i>SCP-22367</i> is not allowed direct contact with any other sapient beings without prior approval from the Site Director or O5 Council. Additionally, all experiments involving <i>SCP-22367</i> must be approved by the Research Department before being conducted.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22367.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-22367</i> was discovered in ██████, Antarctica. It was initially contained by the Antarctic Research Station and transferred to Site-██ for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22367.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-22367</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-22367</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview conducted shortly after <i>SCP-22367</i>'s initial containment.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Greetings, <i>SCP-22367</i>.
