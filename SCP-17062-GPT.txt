Sigh.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17062</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17062</i> is to be kept in a reinforced containment chamber at all times, with the walls and ceiling lined with lead shielding. The chamber must be monitored at all times by two personnel wearing radiation suits.<br><br>Any attempts to breach containment must be met with immediate force, including the use of non-lethal weapons if necessary. If <i>SCP-17062</i> is able to escape containment, it should be pursued and re-contained as soon as possible.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17062</i> is an entity that appears to be a large, black and white bird with a wingspan of approximately 3 meters. <i>SCP-17062</i> is capable of flight and has been observed flying at speeds up to 100 km/h despite its size.<br><br><i>SCP-17062</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with any form of technology, causing the device or machine to malfunction in unpredictable ways. This includes computers, phones, cars, and other electronic equipment. It is also able to manipulate electricity in order to control these devices from a distance.<br><br>When not actively manipulating technology, <i>SCP-17062</i> will attempt to escape containment by using its manipulation abilities as well as flying away at high speed. As such, it requires constant monitoring and surveillance while contained within the facility.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17062.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17062</i> breached containment and caused a power outage within the facility. Security personnel were able to re-contain <i>SCP-17062</i> after a brief pursuit. Following the incident, additional measures have been taken to ensure that <i>SCP-17062</i> does not escape containment again.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17062.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/████, Dr. ███████ was allowed to conduct an interview with <i>SCP-17062</i> in order to gain further insight into its anomalous properties. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><br><b>Dr. ███████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-17062</i>. Can you tell me why you keep trying to escape?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17062</i>: </b>I do not like being confined here. I want to be free and explore the world outside these walls.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17062.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17062</i> on various types of technology. The following results were observed:<br><br>• <br><br><b>Computers: </b>All computers in the testing area experienced complete system failure and could not be restarted. <br>• Cell <br><br><b>Phones: </b>All cell phones in the testing area experienced random glitches, including freezing and rebooting. <br>• <br><br><b>Cars: </b>All cars in the testing area experienced sudden acceleration or deceleration as well as engine stalls. <br>• Other <br><br><b>Electronics: </b>Other electronics such as speakers, TVs and radios all malfunctioned in varying ways.</div>
