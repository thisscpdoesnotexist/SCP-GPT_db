When Agent ██████ came into contact with <i>SCP-9700</i> he became dirty and his clothes were stained with dirt and mud. After testing it was discovered that any living thing that comes into contact with <i>SCP-9700</i> will become dirty or stained depending on what they are wearing or if they are not wearing anything at all.<br><br><h3><br><br><b>Recovery:</b></h3> <i>SCP-9700</i> was found in the bathroom of a house in ██████, Texas. <i>SCP-9700</i> was found by Agent ██████ who then reported it to Site-██.<br><br><h3><br><br><b>Addendum 9700.1 :</b></h3> Interview with Agent ██████<br><br><b><br><br><b>Interviewed:</b>  Agent ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer:</b>  Dr.██████ </b> <br><br><b> Foreword:</b> The following is an interview with the agent who found <i>SCP-9700</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b> Dr.██████:</b> Hello, and welcome to Site-██, I am Dr.████████ and this is Agent ██████ who found <i>SCP-9700</i>. So tell me how you found it?<br><br><b> Agent ██████:</b> Well I was on a mission to find anomalous items when I came across a house in the town of █████████, Texas that had no one living there for over 20 years so I decided to check it out just in case there were any anomalous items inside of it but when I got inside of the house there was nothing but dust and cobwebs everywhere so after searching through all of the rooms in the house except for one room which was locked from the outside by a padlock that had rust on it so after breaking down the door to get into that room I saw <i>SCP-9700</i> sitting on top of a toilet seat with some dried up feces next to it which made me think that someone must have been using this before they died or left town because no one would use something like this unless they were desperate for toilet paper or if they didn't care about their hygiene at all then after picking up <i>SCP-9700</i> and taking off my gloves so that i could feel what it felt like before putting them back on again then touching my face while still holding onto <i>SCP-9700</i> then looking at my hand afterwards discovering that i was dirty from touching myself without washing my hands first then reporting back here about what happened during my mission <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><b> Closing Statement:</b> After hearing what happened during his mission we decided not to give him any more missions until he has washed his hands thoroughly.<br><br><h3><br><br><b>Addendum 9700.2 :</b></h3> Testing Log<br><br><b>Test #:</b> 1<br><br><b>Subject:</b> D-9700-1, a D-class personnel.<br><br><b>Procedure:</b> D-9700-1 was told to touch <i>SCP-9700</i> with his left hand. After he touched it he was told to wash his hand in the sink in the room. When he did this it was discovered that his hand became dirty and stained with dirt and mud. It should be noted that when D-9700 touched <i>SCP-9700</i> there were no stains on him before testing began.<br><br><b>Test #:</b> 2<br><br><b>Subject:</b> A mouse (Mus musculus) that is used for testing at Site ████. The mouse is contained in a glass container at all times while not being tested on or used for experiments by Dr ██████ and other researchers at Site ████. The mouse has been given the nickname <i>"Mr Mousey"</i> by Dr ██████ because of its species name and because it is always being tested on or experimented on by Dr ██████ or other researchers at Site ████, but mostly because of its species name which sounds like <i>"mousy"</i>. Mr Mousey has been given this nickname since day one when it arrived from [REDACTED]. Mr Mousey will be referred to as Mm from now on for shortness purposes only, nothing else is known about Mm except what has been written here so far about him/her/it/them etc…<br><br><b>Procedure:</b> Mm was placed into a glass container along with <i>SCP-9700</i> which had already been placed into another glass container beforehand so that no one would get dirty during testing unless they wanted to do so themselves just for funsies! Then both containers were put onto a table next to each other then Agent K██████ opened both containers then took out Mm then put him onto the floor of the room where both containers are located while Agent K██████ took out SCP 97000 then put it down onto the floor next to Mm who had already made himself comfortable after getting out of his glass container earlier without anyone's help! Then Agent K██████ walked away from them both leaving them alone together until someone came back later after a few minutes later!<br><br><b>Results:</b> After waiting around 5 minutes later Agent K██████ came back into the room where both containers are located along with some paper towels and cleaning supplies just in case something went wrong during testing like someone got dirty or something happened during testing like an explosion or something else happened during testing but luckily nothing bad happened during this test besides one thing which I will talk about later but first I must tell you what happened first before talking about what I have mentioned earlier! So anyways after coming back into the room Agent K██████ saw that there wasn't anything unusual going on between Mm & 97000 except for one thing which I will talk about later but first let me tell you what else happened besides what I have mentioned earlier before telling you what else happened besides those things! So anyways after seeing everything going fine between 97000 & mmmmmm agent k returned back outside again leaving them alone again until someone comes back again sometime soon hopefully? But anyways lets move forward shall we?<br><br></div>
