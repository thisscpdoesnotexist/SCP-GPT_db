The wall is to be patrolled by guards at all times. Any civilians attempting to enter <i>SCP-14561</i> are to be detained and questioned about their motives for entering the building . If they refuse or fail to answer, they are not allowed back into the area under any circumstances . Civilians who have been identified as missing persons from this area are not allowed back into the area under any circumstances .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14561</i> is a building located in ████████, ██. <i>SCP-14561</i> was built in 19██ and has been abandoned for over 50 years. The building is heavily infested with entities that are believed to be ghosts or demons . These entities are capable of making themselves invisible and can move objects around the building. When an entity makes itself visible, it appears as a human wearing a black cloak with no facial features except for eyes that glow red.<br><br><i>SCP-14561</i> was discovered by the foundation after reports of several missing people in the area started coming in. Agents were sent to investigate <i>SCP-14561</i> and found several corpses that had been mutilated by sharp objects such as knives or scissors . Several corpses had their limbs cut off while others were decapitated or disemboweled . The agents also found several notes written on pieces of paper scattered around the building which all read <i>"We will find you."</i> along with other messages such as <i>"You're next"</i> and <i>"We're coming for you"</i>. The agents also reported seeing blood dripping from walls inside the building even though no bodies were found inside it at first glance . After further investigation, researchers discovered traces of human blood on various surfaces inside <i>SCP-14561</i> including walls , floors , doors , windows etc… In addition to this, researchers also discovered various footprints belonging to different people (most likely civilians) within SCP- 1456 1 however most footprints have been covered up by unknown means making them impossible to identify . All these findings led researchers to conclude that civilians have been disappearing from this area due to supernatural causes possibly caused by an infestation of ghosts/demons within SCP - 1456 1<br><br><h3>Addendum 14561.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████, a civilian who has been missing for over 2 months.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with ███████ ██████ , a civilian who has been missing for over 2 months . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.████████: </b>Hello Mr . █████████, my name is Dr .████████ and I'll be the one conducting this interview. How are you feeling today? Mr . <br><br><b>█████████: </b>I'm fine but I want to know why the hell am I here? Why did you take me away from my home? <br><br><b>Dr.████████: </b>We found you wandering around in <i>SCP-14561</i> which was infested with ghosts or demons of some sort that have caused several people to disappear within this area so we had to detain you for your own safety and also because we needed information about what happened in there before we could let you go back home Mr . <br><br><b>█████████: </b>So that's why…I knew it! Those things took my family away from me! They took them all away! <br><br><b>Dr.████████: </b>What do you mean by <i>"those things"</i>? Mr . <br><br><b>█████████: </b>The demons! They killed everyone in there and then they came after us too but we managed to escape before they could get us too ! But then they started coming after us at our house so we had no choice but to run away ! But now look at me…I'm stuck here while those monsters are still out there somewhere roaming free while I'm stuck here rotting in this place ! You have no idea how horrible it feels knowing that those monsters are still out there somewhere while I can't even do anything about it ! It's not fair!
