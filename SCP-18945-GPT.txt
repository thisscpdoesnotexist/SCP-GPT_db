The world's biggest goth girlfriend.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18945<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18945</i> is a 50 foot tall humanoid entity of indeterminate gender with pale skin, long black hair, and gothic clothing. Its eyes are completely black and its face appears to be constantly in an expression of sadness. It moves slowly and speaks in a low voice that can be heard up to 500 feet away.<br><br><i>SCP-18945</i>'s primary anomalous property is its size; it is capable of growing or shrinking at will, though it prefers to remain at its current height. The entity has no known limits on the amount of mass it can contain within itself when enlarged or reduced in size; however, any such changes appear to cause <i>SCP-18945</i> considerable discomfort.<br><br>When approached by humans, <i>SCP-18945</i> expresses an intense desire for companionship and affection from them; if allowed access to human contact (in the form of physical contact or conversation), <i>SCP-18945</i> will become increasingly friendly towards them over time. It also displays a marked preference for goth culture, often engaging in conversations about music, fashion and other related topics with those who share this interest. <br><br>If denied access to human contact for extended periods of time (more than one week), <i>SCP-18945</i> will become increasingly agitated until eventually entering into a state referred to as 'the rage'.
