<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-10342</i> is  … well… hrmm… how do I put this, exactly?</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-10342</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-10342</i> instances are to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. They are not allowed to interact with each other, and must be kept under surveillance at all times.<br><br><i>SCP-10342</i> is currently uncontainable, due to the nature of its anomalous properties. It is therefore imperative that <i>SCP-10342</i> instances do not come into contact with any non-anomalous humans outside of Foundation control.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10342</i> is a group of anomalous humans, who are all identical in appearance. They are all between the ages of 18 and 21, and have been found to be completely identical in terms of DNA. All instances have been identified as female, however this has not been confirmed to be an effect caused by <i>SCP-10342</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-10342</i> instances appear to be capable of telepathically communicating with each other across any distance, and can also communicate with non-anomalous humans that they come into contact with. The Foundation has not yet managed to identify how this communication takes place. It is currently believed that <i>SCP-10342</i> instances are able to read the thoughts of those around them, but this has not yet been proven or disproven due to the difficulty involved in testing it out on D-Class personnel without risking a containment breach (see Addendum 10342a).<br><br><i>SCP-10342</i> was first discovered when reports were made by several students at ████████ University regarding a group of new transfer students who appeared <i>"too perfect"</i>. After investigation by Agent ██████ revealed their anomalous properties, they were contained immediately (see Addendum 10342b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10342.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10342</i>-1 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-10342</i>. <br><br><b><i>SCP-10342</i>-1: </b>Hi! I'm so glad you're here! I've been waiting for you guys to come and get me. It's so boring in here by myself. Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Yes, we apologize for the wait. We had to make sure that there were no more of you out there before we could contain you all at once. Now, could you please tell us how exactly your anomalous properties work? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10342</i>-1: </b>Oh, of course! It's really easy… well… except when it isn't… anyway… what do you want to know? Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Well, firstly we'd like to know how exactly your telepathic communication works? How is it that none of the other students have noticed anything strange about any of you? And also how are all of your thoughts identical as well? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10342</i>-1: </b>Ohhh… that's a good question! The telepathy thing is easy; it just happens whenever one of us thinks about something and another one hears it or reads their mind or whatever. As for our thoughts being identical... hmmmmm... welllll…. (SCP 10342 pauses) Ahhhhhh…. I guess they just are because they're mine and they're not yours!! (SCP 10343 looks around the room) But don't worry; my friends don't bite (laughs). You can ask them yourself if you want!! (SCP 10343 looks towards the door) Are my friends here yet?? Can I see them now?? Please??? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At this point in time instances 3 through 20 entered containment cell 2 via an unknown method and began speaking with instance 1 through a previously undiscovered form of communication involving body language and facial expressions rather than speech or thought transference . After several minutes instances 3 through 20 left containment cell 2 via an unknown method . It is currently believed that this was done as a result from instance 1 asking them if they were ready to leave but no means by which instance 1 could have communicated this has been discovered at this time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10342.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10342.1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-10342, a male D-class personnel. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-10342</i>'s containment cell and interact with them for one hour. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After one hour of interaction, subject reported having a headache and feeling slightly nauseous. Subject also reported that he had been able to hear the thoughts of all instances of <i>SCP-10342</i> during the duration of the test, but was unable to identify which instance's thoughts were his own (see Addendum 10342a). <br><br><b>Notes: </b>The subject is believed to have been affected by <i>SCP-10342</i> due to his close proximity with them for an extended period of time. -Dr ██████ Experiment 10342.2:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Two female D-class personnel (D-10432 and D-10433) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were instructed to enter <i>SCP-10342</i>'s containment cell and interact with them for one hour each in separate shifts, while being monitored by Foundation researchers via CCTV cameras installed in their quarters (see Addendum 10343b). <br><br><b>Results: </b>After both subjects had interacted with all instances for one hour each, they reported hearing other people's thoughts as if they were their own during the duration of both tests combined . They also claimed that they could hear other people thinking about things unrelated to themselves , such as <i>"how bad this test is"</i> or <i>"what I'm going eat after this"</i>. <br><br><b>Notes: </b>The two subjects did not report any pain or nausea during or after either experiment . It appears that prolonged exposure may cause an increase in telepathic ability rather than causing pain or nausea as previously thought . -Dr ██████ Experiment 103423<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Three female D - class personnel (D - 10434 , 10435 , 10436 ) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects are instructed to enter SCP - 103422 ' s containment cell individually and interact with all instances simultaneously for one hour each . Each subject will be monitored by Foundation researchers via CCTV cameras installed in their quarters throughout the duration of each experiment . <br><br><b>Results: </b>All three subjects report hearing other people ' s thoughts simultaneously when interacting with all instances at once , but do not experience any signs or symptoms related t o telepathic contact; no headaches nor nausea are experienced by any subjects during or after experimentation . <br><br><b>Notes: </b>This may indicate that there is a limit on how many humans can be affected at once without experiencing adverse effects due to overexposure; however further testing is required before we can confirm this theory.- Dr ██████ Experiment 103442</div>
