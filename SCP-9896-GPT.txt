They are also told not to talk about anything related to their jobs or personal lives while they stay in there together. All three subjects were given standard issue earplugs so they could block out noise from outside of their cell and microphones so researchers can hear what is being said inside of it at all times during the test period as well as see what is going on inside of it via CCTV cameras placed around it's interior walls and ceiling, which are connected directly into Site 19's security network, allowing researchers watch everything that happens within it via their computer screens at all times during this test period as well as record everything that happens within it via CCTV recordings throughout its duration without having any risk of being discovered by anyone who might be watching them do this from another location at any time during this experiment . Researchers will also be able to monitor audio levels within its interior using built in microphones placed around its interior walls and ceiling , which will allow them listen closely for any conversations between either subject or between both subjects if they end up talking with each other about anything related to their jobs or personal lives while inside of there together .
