It has three slots on its top panel, each slot being 10 cm wide. When an item is placed into any of the slots, <i>SCP-18527</i> will begin to vibrate rapidly before producing a series of cutting blades which will then proceed to shred the item placed within it.<br><br>Once an item has been successfully shredded by <i>SCP-18527</i>, it will create a small paper envelope containing the shredded remains of the object inside it. This envelope can be opened with ease and its contents can be used for any purpose desired by the user.<br><br>The anomalous property of <i>SCP-18527</i> lies in its ability to personalize itself according to the user's preferences; when operated by someone other than its original owner (designated as <i>"User A"</i>), <i>SCP-18527</i> will adjust its settings so that items placed within it are shredded into shapes based on User A's desires or instructions. For example, if User A instructs <i>SCP-18527</i> to <i>"shred this document into tiny pieces"</i>, then all documents placed within one of its slots would be cut up into tiny fragments instead of being fully destroyed like normal objects would be when put through a regular shredder.<br><br>Furthermore, if User A were to place their own hand inside one of <i>SCP-18527</i>'s slots while giving instructions such as <i>"shred my hand but leave my fingers intact"</i>, then their hand would emerge unscathed from the slot after being processed through <i>SCP-18527</i>'s blades - all except for their fingertips which had been removed completely due to following User A's orders exactly as they had been given. <br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18527</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-18527</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any personnel attempting to use <i>SCP-18527</i> must first be given permission by the site director and must have their instructions for its usage approved before being allowed access. Any attempts at unauthorized usage of <i>SCP-18527</i> are strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18527.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, User A was identified as Dr. ██████, a former researcher at Site-██ who had gone missing several months prior. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that Dr. ██████ had been experimenting with <i>SCP-18527</i> in an attempt to create a device capable of customizing the destruction of any object placed within it according to his own personal specifications.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18527.2: </h3> Interview with User A<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> User A (designated as such upon discovery of <i>SCP-18527</i>)<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, you were the one who originally owned this shredder? Can you tell me how it came to be in your possession? <br><b><br>User A:</b> It was given to me by a friend as a gift. They said it was something special and that I should take good care of it. <br><b><br> Dr. ██████:</b> Interesting… Do you have any idea why they gave it to you or what its purpose is? <br><b>User A:</b> No, not really. They just told me that I would know when the time was right. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I see. Do you know how it works? <br><b>User A:</b> Not really, no. It just seemed to do whatever I asked it to do - no matter how strange the request was. <br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Alright, thank you for your time. That will be all. <br><b>User A:</b> No problem.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18527.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test A - Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b>Subject:</b> One (1) sheet of paper<br><b>Instructions:</b> <i>"Shred this document into tiny pieces"</i><br><b>Result:</b> The sheet of paper was successfully shredded by <i>SCP-18527</i> into a large number of small fragments. <br><b><br>Test B - Date:</b> ██/██/20██ <br><b>Subject:</b> One (1) human hand belonging to User A <br><b>Instructions:</b> <i>"Shred my hand but leave my fingers intact"</i> <br><b>Result:</b> User A's hand emerged unscathed from the slot, with all five fingertips having been removed completely.</div>
