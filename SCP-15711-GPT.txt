No personnel are allowed to use <i>SCP-15711</i> for any reason.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15711</i> is a camera with no lens. It was found in the possession of ████ █████, who claims to have bought it from a thrift store in ███████, Pennsylvania. The object appears to be an ordinary camera, but when used for photography, the pictures taken show only <i>SCP-15711</i> itself.<br><br><i>SCP-15711</i> has been shown to have anomalous properties when connected to any computer running Microsoft Windows XP or later versions of the operating system. When connected via USB cable and left idle for approximately one hour, <i>SCP-15711</i> will install itself as a device driver on the computer and begin transmitting information directly into its memory. This data appears to be random images taken by <i>SCP-15711</i>; however, they are not actually stored on its memory card (which is nonfunctional). If ejected from the computer while still connected via USB cable or if removed from its SD card reader slot while powered on and inserted into a digital camera or other device that can read SD cards , <i>SCP-15711</i> will begin emitting electromagnetic radiation at frequencies between 100 MHz and 5 GHz . Its signal strength varies depending on whether it is powered off or not; if powered off , it emits 10 dBm at 1 GHz ; if switched on , it emits 30 dBm at 1 GHz .<br><br>The radiation emitted by <i>SCP-15711</i> causes electronic devices within 100 meters of itself to malfunction. Devices affected include televisions and computers running Microsoft Windows XP or later versions of the operating system (including tablets), as well as any devices that use Wi - Fi technology such as smartphones and routers . Affected devices display an error message reading <i>"This device has malfunctioned,"</i> followed by <i>"Do you want your PC repaired?"</i> This message will appear even if there are no users logged onto said computers/devices at time of exposure; this may indicate that some form of artificial intelligence is controlling this anomalous effect but further research is required before making such conclusions. After approximately two minutes after initial exposure begins, all affected devices will become completely unresponsive until disconnected from power source(s) for more than one minute; thus far there has been no way found to repair them without complete replacement parts (usually motherboard). If using another operating system besides Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 , all exposed devices remain functional indefinitely unless disconnected from power source(s) for more than one minute . No attempts have been made so far regarding exposing non - electronic objects such as paper documents due<br><br><h3>Addendum 15711.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ █████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. C█████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to determine the origin of <i>SCP-15711</i> and why it is emitting electromagnetic radiation. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. C█████████: </b>Hello, Mr. █████, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today about your camera. You have been informed of the nature of <i>SCP-15711</i>? ████ <br><br><b>█████: </b>Yes, I have; I've been told that it's a camera that takes pictures of itself when you use it? <br><br><b>Dr. C█████████: </b>That's correct; do you know how you obtained this object? ████ <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well, I bought it at a thrift store in [REDACTED], Pennsylvania about three months ago for $2 USD . It looked like an ordinary camera so I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend but when she tried using it she said that all the photos came out blank except for one picture which showed the same thing over and over again; she didn't seem too happy about that so we took turns taking pictures with her phone instead . <br><br><b>Dr. C█████████: </b>Did anything unusual happen after your first exposure to <i>SCP-15711</i> ? ██ ███: No… wait! Now that you mention it , yeah! After we left the store my girlfriend received several calls from some weird guy who kept asking her questions like <i>"What are your favorite colors?"</i> or <i>"What do you think is going on right now?"</i> She wasn't sure what he was talking about but then he started saying things like <i>"I'm watching you"</i> and other creepy stuff like that before hanging up on her every time . We thought nothing of this until later on when we were at dinner with our friends and they got similar calls from him as well ! We never found out who he was or where he got our numbers from but ever since then my girlfriend refuses to use any electronic devices anymore because she thinks there might be cameras watching us all the time… even though none of us actually own any cameras ! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview, Mr. ███ refused further questioning regarding his involvement with <i>SCP-15711</i> unless provided legal counsel present during such interviews (which has been approved).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15711.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15711-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92321, a Class D personnel with a history of grand theft auto and vandalism.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15711</i> was connected to the computer in D-92321's containment cell. The subject was instructed to use it for photography purposes. No other personnel were present in the room at time of experiment.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After one hour, <i>SCP-15711</i> installed itself as a device driver on the computer and began transmitting data into its memory. Approximately three minutes after exposure began , all electronic devices within 100 meters of <i>SCP-15711</i> (including surveillance equipment) malfunctioned and displayed error messages similar to those found when using Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 . After approximately two minutes , all affected devices became unresponsive; however, they were not shut down completely until disconnected from power source(s) for more than one minute . Further research is required regarding this effect's range and limitations (see Experiment 15711 -2).<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-15711</i> has an effective range of approximately 100 meters; however this is only accurate when used on computers running Microsoft Windows XP or later versions of the operating system . If used on any other operating system besides Microsoft Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 , its effective range is infinite (see Experiment 15711 -3).<br><br>Experiment 15711 -2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 92321, same conditions as previous experiment. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A nonfunctional desktop computer running Linux OS was placed within 100 meters of SCP - 1571 1 ; it had been previously fitted with an RFID reader designed by Dr ██████ to detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects within its detection radius . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Three minutes after exposure began, all electronic devices within 100 meters of both SCP - 1571 1 and the RFID reader malfunctioned similarly to previous experiments ; however, unlike before they did not become unresponsive until disconnected from power source(s) for more than one minute . Disconnecting either object caused them both to cease emitting electromagnetic radiation immediately; thus far there has been no way found to repair them without complete replacement parts (usually motherboard). <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that SCP - 1571 1 ' s signal strength varies depending upon whether it is powered off or not ; if powered off , it emits 10 dBm at 1 GHz ; if switched on , it emits 30 dBm at 1 GHz . However despite this difference in signal strength between powered off vs powered on states , both cause identical effects when exposed together under identical circumstances ; further research is required regarding this anomaly's nature before making such conclusions about possible connections between these two effects directly causing each other due [DATA EXPUNGED] Addendum <br><br><b>15712: </b>On ██ /██/ 20██ during testing involving multiple instances of SCPs simultaneously exposed together without proper safety measures being taken against potential cross contamination resulting from their combined anomalous properties interacting with each other simultaneously while also having their ranges overlapping each other's resulting in massive amounts EM radiation being emitted into Site 19 which resulted in over ███ casualties including several members belonging to MTF units Alpha - 4 (<i>"Mole Rats"</i>) and Beta – 3 (<i>"Rag Tag Circus"</i>), Site Director [REDACTED], O5 Council member [REDACTED], O5 Council member [REDACTED], O5 Council member [REDACTED] among others resulting in massive loss of life along with severe damage done by numerous simultaneous containment breaches across Site 19 affecting several SCPs including but limited too SCPs 049 (<i>"The Black Oil"</i>), 096 (<i>"The Old Man"</i>), 106 (<i>"Cthulhu"</i>, <i>"Cthulhu"</i>, <i>"Cthulhu"</i>) among others resulting in widespread destruction throughout Site 19 along with causing total collapse from upper levels down causing catastrophic damage leading up towards total destruction followed by complete obliteration via nuclear detonation which destroyed over 90% site 19 leaving only small fragments remaining along with radioactive fallout contaminating surrounding areas for miles around site 19 rendering entire area uninhabitable for decades afterwards leading up towards permanent termination event horizon scenario scenario scenario scenario</div>
