It has been described as <i>"strangely big"</i> by all who have seen it. It has an abnormally large amount of meat and cheese, but still fits in the palm of a human hand. The burger's size is not affected by any means, including cutting it into smaller pieces or putting condiments on it. <i>SCP-15485</i> cannot be eaten due to its size, although many have tried to do so (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15485.1 : </h3>██/██/<br><br><b>████: </b>Dr. ██████ was the first to attempt to eat <i>SCP-15485</i>.

It's just too big! Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>How did you try eating it? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well, first I cut it into six pieces and put ketchup on each one of them… then I tried putting some meat in my mouth… then I chewed for a while… then swallowed the chewed meat… after that I just couldn't swallow anymore!

I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-15485</i>. Can you tell me how it was made? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Sure! Well… It was just a normal burger at first… but then I accidentally dropped it on the floor and stepped on it! Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Why did you step on it? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Because I wanted to make sure that no one could eat it! Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Why did you want to do that? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Because I thought that if someone ate my burger, they would die from its size! That's why I made sure no one could eat it by stepping on the pieces and putting them in a trash bag! Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>What happened after that? <br><br><b>Mr. [REDACTED]: </b>Nothing happened after that… well, except for when Dr.[REDACTED] tried eating my burger and died from its size like what I had predicted would happen if someone ate my burger… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview, Dr.[REDACTED] was found dead in his office due to an apparent heart attack caused by stress brought upon by his attempt at eating <i>SCP-15485</i> (see Addendum 15485-3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15485.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-82921, a 32-year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was given <i>SCP-15485</i> and told to eat it.
