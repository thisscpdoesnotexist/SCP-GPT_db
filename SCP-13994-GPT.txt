It is to be maintained there by means of an implanted false memory of its containment. This false memory is to be refreshed and reinforced every day through direct mental contact.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-13994</i> is a human male of indeterminate age. It has the ability to manipulate reality, but only within a certain area around itself. This area is approximately 2 meters in diameter and extends through all solid matter. The exact limits of this area are impossible to determine, as <i>SCP-13994</i> can alter the perception of any being within it to make them believe that they are outside its range.<br><br><i>SCP-13994</i> cannot be perceived or interacted with by any person who has not been directly affected by it in some way (see Addendum). It can be perceived visually by anyone who falls under its effects, but only as a silhouette or blur that appears randomly between solid objects and disappears when looked at directly. When perceived visually, <i>SCP-13994</i> appears as an amorphous black figure that moves quickly from one side of the visual field to another without traversing the space between them (see Video Log 13994-1).<br><br><i>SCP-13994</i>'s primary anomalous effect manifests when any person perceives it while inside its effective radius; after this point, no other being can perceive <i>SCP-13994</i> unless they have also been exposed to it previously. Once this occurs, <i>SCP-13993</i> will begin manipulating reality so that no information about itself exists or ever existed in the affected subject's brain; however, if questioned about their memories regarding <i>SCP-13993</i> , subjects will report having perfect recall of all details surrounding their exposure to it (see Interview Log 13993). In addition, subjects exposed to SCP - 13 994 will become unable or unwilling to discuss their memories with others who have not also been exposed . As such , information regarding SCP - 1 3 993 is limited entirely t o those individuals who were originally exposed . <br><br><b>Addendum: </b>The following are excerpts from interviews conducted with subjects affected by SCP - 1399 4: + Interview Log 1 3 993 - 1 - Hide log <br><br><b>Date: </b>██ / █ / 20██ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Subject was one of three individuals present during initial containment breach on ██/██/20██ .

I'm sorry for your loss; I know this is difficult for you. We just need to ask a few questions about your father's work here at the Foundation. Is that alright? <i>SCP-13993</i> -2: Yeah , sure . Wha t do you want to k now ? D r . K: Well , first off, how did he die? W h a t happened at Site 17 ? S C P - 1 3 993 - 2: [Subject is silent for approximately two minutes] He didn't tell me much about his work here; he said it was classified and not something we could talk about in front of others… but I think he knew what killed him as soon as it happened. Something changed in him after we got home from that trip to Site 17… like he'd seen something horrible and couldn't stop thinking about it… D r . K: What do you mean by <i>"something horrible"</i>? S C P - 1 3 993 - 2: [Subject rubs eyes with thumb and forefinger.] It's hard to explain… It wasn't anything tangible or physical; it was more like an idea or a memory or something like that … He kept saying things were different somehow , but refused to tell me why … T h e n o n e d a y , w h e n w e w e r e l i v i n g i n L o s A g u l o s , h e c a m e t o m y b d r & # 4 8 ; & # 4 8 ; & # 4 8 ; H E H A D F O R G O T T E N M Y N A M E !

When questioned further about its appearance , subject described it as <i>"a shadow that seemed to move from side to side without actually going anywhere"</i>. Subject was then informed that this description matched what other subjects who had been exposed to SCP - 13993 had reported seeing .

He expressed frustration at his inability or unwillingness to discuss these memories with anyone who hadn't been exposed themselves; however, when asked if he remembered anything specific about how long he was in there or what happened while he was there , all memory appeared intact and no unusual behavior exhibited itself.
