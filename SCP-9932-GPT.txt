Any personnel attempting to interact with <i>SCP-9932</i> are to be terminated immediately.<br><br><i>SCP-9932</i>'s containment cell is to have a chessboard set up at all times, along with two sets of pieces (one black and one white). If <i>SCP-9932</i> requests more pieces or boards, it must be denied.<br><br><i>SCP-9932</i> must not come within 5 meters of any electronic device capable of displaying text or images.

It is currently located in the basement of Site-███ and has been playing chess against itself since its discovery on ██/██/199█.<br><br><i>SCP-9932</i> was discovered when Foundation personnel were called to investigate reports of a <i>"ghost"</i> haunting Site-███. <i>SCP-9932</i> was found sitting next to a table with an unfinished game of chess and the remains of two men, one dressed as a janitor and the other dressed as a security guard. Both men had suffered severe cranial trauma consistent with blunt force trauma from an object similar to SCP-████ but much larger, estimated at around 3 meters long (See Addendum 9932a).<br><br>When asked about what happened, <i>SCP-9932</i> claimed that it had been playing chess against itself for years until it became bored and decided to play something new like checkers or Go. The game lasted for approximately 5 minutes until both players were killed by SCP-████ (See Addendum 9932a). When asked if it knew who caused their deaths, <i>SCP-9932</i> replied that <i>"the black one always loses"</i>. It then requested that someone be sent down so it could finish its game before closing itself off from further questioning by displaying text reading 'GAME OVER'. Personnel have not attempted communication with <i>SCP-9933</i> since then due to its hostile nature towards humans.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9932.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ███████, creator of <i>SCP-9932</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on 10/03/199█, shortly after the discovery of <i>SCP-9932</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr. █████████ and I'll be conducting this interview with you today. Could you please state your name for the record? <br><br><b>Mr.██████: </b>Sure thing doc, my name's █████████ and I'm the one who built this thing back in '89 when it was still legal to do so in East Germany before that bastard [REDACTED] took over and banned everything fun like video games or computers that weren't made by IBM or Apple (laughs). Anyways, what do you want to know about it? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Well first off I'd like to ask why did you build it? <br><br><b>Mr.██████: </b>Well back in '89 there wasn't much else to do besides play chess against yourself so me and my buddies would get together at night after work and have a few beers while we played each other but we got bored of doing that so we decided to make something new out of spare parts from our factory but then…well let's just say things went wrong when some idiot put a floppy disk into its memory banks instead of a hard drive (laughs). We didn't even know what happened until it started playing chess by itself with two sets of pieces! Me and my buddies were pretty impressed by how well it could play at first until one day someone left their laptop on top of its CPU unit without realizing it was there which caused us all kinds of problems later on down the line (laughs). Now tell me doc, what kind of sick person would stick a computer into an old robot suit just so they could pretend they're Iron Man or Captain America while they fight crime? That's just crazy talk right there! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was conducted several attempts were made by personnel to remove <i>SCP-9933</i> from its current containment cell which resulted in multiple casualties during attempted breaches as well as extensive damage done to Site-███'s infrastructure due to <i>SCP-9933</i> using its abilities during these attempts (See Addendum 9932a)<br><br><h3>Addendum 9932.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 9932-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9932</i> and D-9341 armed with a 9mm pistol.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is to stand in front of <i>SCP-9932</i> and attempt to communicate with it. If communication is established, D-9341 is to ask <i>SCP-9932</i> how it killed the janitor and security guard. After obtaining this information, D-9341 is to attempt to replicate the events that led up to their deaths. This will be done by firing 6 rounds from a 9mm pistol into <i>SCP-9932</i>'s containment cell while standing in front of it (See Addendum 9932a). Any damage done will be repaired after testing has concluded.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon entering the containment cell, D-9341 was immediately shot by an unknown force coming from inside of <i>SCP-9933</i> (See Addendum 9932a). The force caused severe trauma similar to what was observed on the remains of the two men found next to SCP-. No other anomalous properties were detected during this experiment.
