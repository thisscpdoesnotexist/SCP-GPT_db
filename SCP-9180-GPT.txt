When a potential sighting of <i>SCP-9180</i> is found, MTF Eta-10 (<i>"See No Evil"</i>) will be dispatched to investigate the sighting. If a potential sighting of <i>SCP-9180</i> is determined to be authentic, MTF Eta-10 will attempt communication with the entity in order to determine their motivations and affiliations.<br><br>MTF Eta-10 has built an underground bunker beneath their headquarters in ████████, Oregon as a base of operations for containment of <i>SCP-9180</i>. The bunker was designed by Drs. ██████ and ██████ . The entryway into the bunker features two sliding doors with locking pins made from modified artillery shells connected via single strand wire (see Addendum 9180/A). During construction of this area, foundations were laid down specifically designed by Drs. ██████ and ██████ so that if an earthquake occurs within a ten kilometer radius it would trigger the explosives located throughout both doorways simultaneously causing them to explode into small fragments dispersed over a large area preventing any entry or exit from this location (see Addendum 9180/B). Additionally, four surveillance cameras are set up at each cardinal direction monitoring all movement within approximately one kilometer radius around the facility (see Addendum 9180/C).<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9180</i> is an anomalous humanoid entity with solid white eyes and no facial features. It stands at 2.1 meters tall and weighs approximately 115 kilograms. <i>SCP-9180</i> wears a dark gray suit, dark scarf/neck wrap, black rimmed glasses and a fedora hat along with dress shoes.<br><br>It has been observed to be able to communicate verbally in English (although it is speculated that it can only speak English). <i>SCP-9180</i> claims to be the proprietor of an online store named <i>"The Shopkeeper's Emporium"</i>. The entity offers any item requested by the customer within a two week period, provided they have enough money to purchase said item (see Addendum 9180/D). All purchases made are delivered through the mail system within two weeks by a variety of different delivery services depending on where the order was placed from . When asked about its origins or affiliations with any groups, <i>SCP-9180</i> will say that it does not know what those things mean. When asked about its motivation for being in business, <i>SCP-9180</i> will reply by saying <i>"To make life more interesting for everyone."</i> See Document 9180a for complete list of items sold under name of The Shopkeeper's Emporium" .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9180</i> was discovered when a local newspaper in ██████, Oregon reported that an individual named Jacob ██████ had ordered the disinterment of his deceased child from their grave. According to the article, Mr. ██████ had <i>SCP-9180</i> print out photographs of him standing next to his son's body and then proceeded to order a reinterment of the body ten days later along with dissection tools and embalming materials (see Addendum 9180/E). Foundation agents intercepted the package containing these items and tracked down Mr. ██████ leading to their first encounter with <i>SCP-9180</i> .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9180.1 :</h3> Interview<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9180</i> Interviewer: Dr. ██████ <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ██████: Hello, I'm here to ask you a few questions regarding your business practices.<br> <i>SCP-9180</i>: Oh, so soon? I thought that we had more time! But if you have questions then I guess it's time to start talking. Dr.<br> ██████: Why did you choose this area of the country to set up your business? <i>SCP-9180</i> chuckles in what appears to be a very amused manner and leans back in its seat . (<i>SCP-9180</i>): Well it was something that… just came up? It seemed like the perfect spot for my little shop so why not? If there were any other reason for doing it then no one told me about it and if they had been planning on telling me about it but never got around to doing so than that really blows because that's sorta important information for running a business! Sooo… are we done with this interview now or do you want me to answer more questions? Cause if we're done then can I please go outside today and at least walk around the block once before having lunch cause my feet aren't getting any younger over here! <End Log><br> Closing Statement: Following this interview, <i>SCP-9180</i> has requested at least once weekly outdoor activities during which time several Foundation guards are assigned to escort them while watching their actions carefully (see Addendum 9180/F).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9180.2 :</h3> Incident 9180-Alpha<br><br>On 1/19/20██, <i>SCP-9180</i> requested to see a live music concert in the area. Permission was granted and <i>SCP-9180</i> was escorted by four armed guards to the venue where they were seated and observed by additional armed guards (see Addendum 9180/G). Approximately 2 hours after the show began, ████ ██████ took a seat next to <i>SCP-9180</i> and produced a small pistol from his pocket along with three blank pieces of paper. Security noticed this and proceeded to tackle Mr. ██████ before he could pull out anything else from his bag . During this altercation, one of the blank pieces of paper was thrown onto <i>SCP-9180</i>'s lap while Mr. ██████'s hand remained on it with his thumb pressing down on one corner causing it to fold into an origami bird shape (see Addendum 9180/H). At this time, Dr Adams who had been observing through surveillance cameras in another room ran over to Mr. ██████'.s seat and grabbed him before he could do anything further (see Addendum 9180/I). A few minutes later Dr Adams escorted Dr Steinway into the room along with two other guards where they helped restrain Mr. ██████ while MTF Eta-10 performed an emergency dissection .<br><br>The autopsy revealed that <i>SCP-918</i> 0'<br>s stomach contained several items including:<br><br>1 lollipop made out of</div>
