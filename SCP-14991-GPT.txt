Any individuals who have been affected by <i>SCP-14991</i> are to be detained in a standard humanoid containment cell.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14991</i> is a phenomenon affecting all members of the furry fandom. <i>SCP-14991</i> causes affected individuals to believe that they are physically transformed into an anthropomorphic animal, commonly referred to as an <i>"anthro"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-14991</i> was first discovered on 4/18/2014 after several reports were made by members of the furry fandom claiming that they had been physically transformed into anthro animals. Foundation personnel were dispatched and began tracking down affected individuals. It was discovered that these transformations were not physical in nature, but instead caused by alterations in perception and cognition. The source of this phenomenon was traced to a website known as <i>"FurryScape"</i>, which contained information on how to perform these transformations using hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms.<br><br><h3>Addendum 14991.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14991</i>-1 (formerly known as ████ ███████) </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on 4/20/2014, shortly after <i>SCP-14991</i>-1 was captured. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, 14991-1. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your experience with <i>SCP-14991</i> if that's alright with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14991</i>-1: </b>That's fine by me. <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Alright then, let's begin… What first drew you to the furry fandom? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14991</i>-2: </b>Well I've always been interested in cartoons and comics since I was a kid so it just kinda came naturally to me when I got older and started watching more of them online. It wasn't until around high school that I really became interested in the furry fandom though; it was kind of an accident actually since my friend showed me some of his drawings and we started talking about how cool they were and stuff like that… After that we started going to conventions together every year or so as well as making new friends online who were also into this sorta thing too… So yeah it just kinda happened one day, ya know? Dr. █████ nods while taking notes on her clipboard before continuing questioning <Dr. █████>: And how long have you been a member of the furry fandom now? <br><br><b><i>SCP-149912</i>: </b>Oh geez probably around 10 years now or something like that; pretty sure it's been longer than 10 years anyway but whatever haha! But yeah ever since high school is when I really got into this stuff for real! <Dr.: Okay then next question; what do you believe caused your sudden interest in becoming anthro animals? >SCP 14992 sighs heavily before responding <SCP 14992>: To be honest doc this might sound weird but uh…I think something happened during my senior year at high school..I'm not exactly sure what but uh..it felt like someone else had taken control over my body for some reason or another..and they made me do things which weren't normal at all ya know?! Like um one time they made me go up to random people on the street and ask them if they wanted to join our <i>"club"</i> for example! Or another time where we went up to people in public places asking them if they wanted us to draw pictures of them…or even more crazy shit too!! Like once where we went out into public dressed up as animals wearing nothing but underwear!! It was pretty fucking weird honestly hahahaha!!! But hey maybe those guys were all part of our club too right?! Hahahahaha!!! >Dr.: Please remain calm 14992; there is no need for profanity here today . We can talk about these other events later if needed okay? For now let us focus on your transformation into an anthro animal shall we??<SCP 14992 nods slowly while looking down at his feet> Alright then….now according to our records you first began experiencing symptoms related towards becoming an anthro animal roughly two weeks ago correct ? How did these symptoms manifest themselves ?<SCP 14992 looks back up at Dr.: Uh huh yep definitely two weeks ago today actually!! So anyway um yeah after doing some research online about how people are able get turned into animals ,I decided why not give it a shot myself right?! So uh after getting all sortsa supplies from the local pet store such as dog food bowls ,pet beds ,pet toys ,dog collars etcetera etcetera i took 'em home with me and put 'em away somewhere safe until i could use 'em later …And well after reading through everything again i decided i would try eating psilocybin mushrooms first because those seemed easy enough right?! And so uhh yeah thats what i did …And man oh man did those things work wonders!! Unfortunately though afterwards there wasn't any sorta guidebook telling me what exactly happens next or anything so yea thats why im here today haha! >Dr.: Alright then please continue describing what happened once the effects kicked in.<SCP 14992 pauses briefly before responding <SCP 14992>: Well once i ate those shrooms everything just sorta melted away right!? Everything except for my body anyways haha!! At least thats how it felt anyways lol! Anyways<br><br><h3>Addendum 14991.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 14991-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14991, a 32 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was administered 0.2g of psilocybin mushrooms and instructed to navigate the website <i>"FurryScape"</i>. After approximately 30 minutes, subject began reporting hallucinations and was brought into containment. Subject was interviewed after the effects of the drugs had worn off. Interviewed by Dr. ██████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Let's begin with some basic questions first, shall we? What is your name?<br><br><b>D-14991: </b>I'm… I'm John Smith! Wait, no… That's not right… My name is [REDACTED], that's it!<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Your name is [REDACTED]? What about your age? Can you tell me that at least?<br><br><b>D-14991: </b>Oh yeah! I'm 18 years old now! Wait… No, that can't be right either… Am I still 18 years old?! This isn't making any sense at all! How am I supposed to know who or what I am when nothing makes sense?! It doesn't matter anyway; all my life has been leading up to this moment and now it finally makes sense why everything happened like it did; this is what my life has been building up towards ever since birth! All those times where people would call me a freak or bully me for acting different from everyone else were just tests from God to see if I could handle being an anthro in real life and look at how well they've prepared me for this moment in time; they have made me stronger than ever before so that when God finally decided to make his final judgement on Earth he knew he could count on me as one of his chosen ones!! Now let's get started already so we can spread His word across the world!!!<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please remain calm while we attempt to determine what exactly you are talking about here…. You mentioned something earlier about spreading God's word across the world but how do you plan on doing that exactly? And who are these <i>"chosen ones"</i> you speak of? Are they also transformed into anthropomorphic animals as well?<br><br>D-14991 pauses for several seconds before responding with a blank stare on his face while clenching his fists tightly together in front of him until eventually opening them back up again with tears streaming down both cheeks and falling onto the floor below him with a loud thud . He then begins sobbing uncontrollably . After several minutes pass D-14991 stops crying long enough to respond . D - 1499 1: No one will believe us , no one will listen ; there ' s too much hatred between everyone nowadays , even amongst furries ! We need more time , more time for our message t o spread !
