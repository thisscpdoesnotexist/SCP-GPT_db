<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-28473 is a large quadrupedal reptilian entity, approximately 4.5m in length with a shoulder height of 2.2m. The creature's most distinguishing feature is a pair of retractable bony protrusions located at the posterior end, resembling spiked balls. These orbs are covered in sharp, keratinous spikes, each one capable of extending up to 1m.</p>
<p>The reptile exhibits highly aggressive behavior and an ability to manipulate local weather patterns in a limited area around itself, roughly within a 5km radius. This manipulation most frequently manifests as violent thunderstorms, often accompanied by abnormal lightning strikes which SCP-28473 seems to direct. The entity has a predilection for attacking urban areas, where its actions result in significant destruction and loss of life.</p>
<p>SCP-28473 has also shown signs of sapience, including complex problem-solving abilities and evidence of language comprehension, though it has not yet communicated directly with Foundation personnel.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to SCP-28473's high mobility and destructive potential, a combination of satellite surveillance and ground reconnaissance is constantly employed to track its movements.</p>
<p>A specialized task force, designated Gamma-4 ("Stormchasers"), is dedicated to the immediate deployment to the predicted location of SCP-28473. Gamma-4 is equipped with reinforced vehicles capable of withstanding extreme weather conditions and outfitted with an arsenal of tranquilizing projectiles.</p>
<p>A secondary containment area, Site-117, has been constructed in a remote location with the capacity to temporarily hold SCP-28473. It is equipped with weather manipulation countermeasures and designed to withstand its extraordinary strength and aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach, nearby civilian populations are to be evacuated under the guise of a severe weather warning. Damage control and misinformation campaigns are to be initiated to mask the true cause of any incidents associated with SCP-28473.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Report 28473-Alpha</h3>
<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-28473 breached containment during a transport operation initiated due to the approach of a major civilian populace. Gamma-4 was deployed and successfully recontained SCP-28473 after a prolonged engagement, during which the entity displayed previously undocumented abilities. These included the generation of localized seismic events and the emission of high-decibel sounds capable of disorienting personnel.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Researcher's Notes</h3>
<h4>Dr. Harrow's Log:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-28473 Communication Attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>It is becoming increasingly evident that SCP-28473 may possess a level of intelligence we have not encountered in entities of a similar nature. Efforts to establish a reliable form of communication are underway, with a focus on deciphering the patterns observed in its vocalizations during containment breaches.</p>
<h4>Dr. Jensen's Observations:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> Behavioral Patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-28473's attacks are not random. They follow a path almost reminiscent of a strategic pattern, targeting infrastructure and evading capture with tactics that suggest a complex understanding of human responses.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log 28473</h3>
<h4>Experiment 28473-E7:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A remote-controlled drone was deployed to deliver a package containing several linguistic puzzles to SCP-28473's containment chamber.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-28473 engaged with the puzzles, successfully solving seventy percent. The puzzles it left unsolved were physically destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Whether destruction indicates frustration or a lack of understanding remains to be seen.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 28473-E15:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Personnel introduced a live cow into SCP-28473's containment area during a controlled environment storm generated by the entity.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-28473 ceased storm generation and approached the cow cautiously. After scanning with unknown sensory abilities, it adopted a non-threatening stance. It did not engage in predation.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Behavior suggests ethical or cultural complexity, possible adherence to dietary rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 4: Recovery Log:</h3>
<p>SCP-28473 was first encountered on ██/██/20██, in a small town in ██ █████████ after multiple reports of "a dragon-like monster" causing severe storms and property damage. Foundation agents were dispatched, and with considerable effort, SCP-28473 was tranquilized and transported to Site-117. The origin of SCP-28473 remains unknown; however, investigation into similar mythological entities in various cultures is ongoing.</p>
<p>The containment of SCP-28473 continues to pose a significant challenge due to its unique abilities and intelligence. Research into a more permanent containment solution as well as a deeper understanding of its origins and motivations remains a high priority for the SCP Foundation.</p>
