Dr. █████████ was chosen due to her previous work with the Sesame Street series, and the fact that she had previously worked with ██████ ██████ on a number of occasions prior to his retirement from writing for the show in 1987.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So, Mr. ██████… you wrote this episode?<br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Yeah, I did it as a sort of… goodbye present for Big Bird and all the other characters who were leaving after they cancelled the show in '86 or '87 or whenever it was they finally pulled the plug on us poor schmucks working at that dumpster fire they called a studio lot back then… I'm sorry; I don't mean to sound bitter about it; things were different back then, and I'm just glad to have been able to work with those guys for as long as we did before everything went outta control… but yeah, this was my last one before my contract ran out and I moved onto another project; something about some guy named <i>"Bill"</i> who wanted me to write him some kind of puppet show about his life or something… anyway, enough about me! What's this thing you wanted me here for? This isn't an interview is it? Because if so then count me out because none of these damn kids can get their facts straight anymore! They're either too busy trying not to offend anyone by making sure every character is exactly 50% male or female no matter what species they are or too busy trying not be accused of being racist by putting every character in an animal suit that doesn't match their skin color! And don't even get me started on how many times they've tried recreating Bert's famous line <i>"I love trash!"</i> only now he says <i>"I love diversity!"</i> like he's some kind of bleeding heart liberal instead— [At this point Mr.] Mr. [REDACTED] interrupts [Mr.] Mr.[REDACTED] . Dr.: Excuse me sir but we're actually here because there has been an incident involving your episode 15307 which aired thirty years ago today— Mr.: Oh yeah right! That thing! Well let's see if you can find anything interesting in there; most people just watch it once when it first airs and never bother again— <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this exchange, <i>SCP-15307</i> was played on a nearby television screen while its contents were recorded via video camera for analysis purposes (see Addendum 15307-3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15307.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15307-1: </b>On █/█/████, a copy of the episode was played for D-15307, who had not watched it before. After the segment in which Ernie and Bert discuss Big Bird, D-15307 became unresponsive. After five minutes, he began to cry and banged his head against the wall of his cell until it bled. At this point he ceased crying and began laughing hysterically for approximately ten seconds before becoming unresponsive again.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15307-2: </b>On █/█/████, a copy of <i>SCP-15307</i> was played for D-56789, who had previously seen the episode but did not remember its content due to amnestic treatment after being convicted of murder. As with Experiment 15307-1 , D-56789 became unresponsive after watching <i>SCP-15307</i> . Unlike Experiment 15307 - 1 , however , he remained in this state until termination by security personnel two days later; no further anomalous behavior was recorded during this time period.</div>
