These physical properties are not unusual for raccoons.<br><br><i>SCP-9643</i>'s anomalous properties only become apparent when it travels through space or time. When this occurs, <i>SCP-9643</i> will appear in another location with no additional mass or energy appearing at the initial site of departure. The distance between these two locations is consistent with the speed of light being travelled over that time period , regardless of any extra-universal travel that may occur during transit . <i>SCP-9443</i> can also use this property to travel to different points in its own timeline, allowing for limited temporal exploration .<br><br>If an organism dies within 500 meters (m) of <i>SCP-9643</i> while it is travelling through space or time , it will reappear at its previous location along with an instance of itself from before its death (hereby referred to as an instance 96443). Instances 96443 are physically identical to their progenitor except they have brown eyes instead of yellow ones and wear a brown bow tie instead of a blue one. Instances 96443 exhibit all the same behaviours as their progenitors did prior to their deaths, but do not appear aware that they are dead until informed otherwise by Foundation personnel . This awareness seems to cause them severe mental trauma; all instances covered by this document have committed suicide after being informed about their situation .<br><br><i>SCP-9443</i> was discovered on 03/05/2014 when video footage was recovered showing an instance 96443 undergoing artificial insemination at ██████████ Zoo and Aquarium in ████████, Pennsylvania on 02/19/2014 . Anomalous activity was confirmed after investigation into animal husbandry records revealed that no such procedure had ever occurred there; all animals were accounted for save one raccoon captured on 02/23/2014 which had been dead since 02/20/. Agent ███████ was dispatched shortly thereafter and acquired several instances from subsequent births at other zoos . All captive individuals have since been terminated via incineration once testing procedures were finalized; instances produced by wild parents have proven more difficult to acquire but several have been procured through agent embedded within wildlife sanctuaries across North America [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9643</i> was first discovered on 02/21/2014 after a video file was uploaded to YouTube entitled <i>"ANIMAL WEDDINGS ARE THE BEST!"</i>. After watching the file, users reported feeling nauseous and experiencing mild hallucinations; this effect has been replicated in controlled experiments. Investigation into the origin of both the file and those who uploaded it led to ██████████ Zoo, where <i>SCP-9643</i> was found in its enclosure .<br><br><br>Incident 96443-A: Agent ███████ was dispatched to retrieve an instance 96443 from ██████████ Zoo shortly after <i>SCP-9643</i>'s capture. She successfully acquired one but as she left, she encountered Dr. ████████ , an employee of the zoo who had previously worked with <i>SCP-9443</i> . Agent ███████ reported that he appeared confused about her presence there, asking her how long she'd worked for them and why she wasn't at a conference in California that week . After attempting to convince him<br><br><h3>Addendum 9643.1 :</h3><br> Experiment Log 9643:<br><br>Experiment 9643-1 - 04/09/<br>2014 Subject: <i>SCP-9643</i> Procedure: <i>SCP-9643</i> was transported to Site ██ via helicopter and released into a standard animal containment chamber. A video camera was set up in the chamber and linked to a monitor outside. After it was clear that <i>SCP-9643</i> had entered its active state, the door to its enclosure was opened allowing it access to an adjacent chamber containing one (1) D-class personnel equipped with an oxygen mask . As soon as <i>SCP-9443</i> began approaching the subject, he panicked and attempted to flee through an emergency exit on the opposite side of the room; this triggered a computerized voice system that began reciting passages from <i>"The Raven"</i> by Edgar Allan Poe. The subject collapsed after thirty (30) seconds of exposure due to oxygen deprivation; once this occurred, <i>SCP-9443</i> emerged from his enclosure and approached him. Instance 96443 emerged shortly thereafter wearing a black bow tie instead of its progenitor's blue one .<br> Results: Instance 96443 eventually expired after several months without intervention from Foundation personnel; this caused [DATA EXPUNGED] Experiment 96443 - 07/10/<br>2014 Subject: Two (2)<br> D class personnel both equipped with oxygen masks Procedure: One subject was placed within <i>SCP-9443</i>'s original containment chamber with no other instructions given; control for exposure times for both subjects varied between experiments but all were kept separate from each other at all times until their demises .<br> Results: Both subjects expired without incident immediately after contact with each other. Their respective instances expired shortly thereafter too due to lack of sustenance . Experiment 961034 - 03/11/<br>2015 Subject 1: Agent ████<br><br><br>Subject 2 : Agent ███████ Procedure : One instance is kept in storage while another is tested separately at a remote location along with two agents that have been made aware of their condition as instances 96443. Both agents are issued different tasks during testing which they must complete in order for them or their counterpart survive until communications are reestablished between them five days later . If either agent dies before then , their instance will be removed from testing and terminated via incineration per updated containment procedures ; results will be recorded accordingly but any efforts made by researchers towards contacting or reviving said instances will not be documented here for brevity's sake .<br> Results : Upon completion of testing, one agent successfully completed her assigned task but died afterwards due to complications related blood loss stemming from injuries sustained during completion part two; her instance survived until 0033 hours EST on 03/124415 when she committed suicide by deliberately running into traffic following her release at [REDACTED]. The second agent met his demise half way through his task when he tripped over his own feet whilst attempting escape and fell through ice covering nearby marshland which subsequently drowned him ; both instances survived until 0200 hours EST on 03202015 when they committed suicide again<br><br><h3>Addendum 9643.2 :</h3><br> Interview Log 9643-A:</div>
