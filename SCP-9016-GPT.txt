It is only allow the usage of D class personnel for the study of <i>SCP-9016</i>'s nature. Any Class D personnel who come in contact with <i>SCP-9016</i> are to be terminated immediately.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9016</i> is a planet located in the orbit of the star GPT-288, it is similar to earth in mass, size and chemical composition. <i>SCP-9016</i> has an orbital ring similar to Saturn's except its made up of rock debris. <i>SCP-9016</i> have two moons that resemble Jupiter's moon Io.<br><br><i>SCP-9016</i> have a thin atmosphere composed of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen with trace amounts of sulfuric gases which may be harmful for humans if breathed for extended period or not equipped with proper protection. The temperature on <i>SCP-916</i> varies between -23°C to -3°C depending on its rotation near the poles which creates ice caps at both ends while creating tropical regions near both equator. There are no signs of civilization except several ruins reminiscent to ancient Mesopotamian cities in Iraq and Syria which indicates that they was once inhabited by human like creatures with average humanoid height (1m and 80 cm) and built structures similar in complexity as Mesopotamians but shows no sign or even hint that they were created by them instead it seems like they was created by another unknown race who must've lived there before human kind evolved from apes on Earth (Homo Habilis). This suggest that this place was not formed naturally but artificially modified for habitation before humans came into existence on Earth within 4 billion years ago; however this suggests [DATA EXPUNGED] [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><br>SCP 9016 GPT: Image taken after observations from satellite SCPS: Discovery 1<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-</i><br>9016 was first discovered by satellite SCPS: Discovery 1 after it's orbital path had altered from its original path. The satellite took several photos of <i>SCP-9016</i> and the surrounding area before losing communication with ground control and went off course, this lead to an investigation about <i>SCP-9016</i> and the origination of <i>SCP-9016</i>.<br><br>The reason for it's orbit change is still unknown, but we can assume that if we had detected SCP 9016 earlier then maybe we could've avoided this situation right now.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9016.1 :</h3> Abridged interview of <i>SCP-9016</i>-1.<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9016</i>-<br>1 Interviewer: Agent ██████<br> Foreword: The following interview was conducted after the death of SCP 9016-1, A Class D personnel who had made contact with SCP 9016 during his observation mission. <Begin Log> Agent ██████: Good evening, please state your name for the record. SCP 9016-1 : ████ ████████ , I am a research scientist of Site 19 and member of Mobile Task Force Omega 7 <i>"Pandora's Box"</i> . Agent ██████: Can you tell me what happened during your mission to study SCP 9016? [SCP 9016-1 remained silent] Agent ██████ : Please answer the question. [SCP 9026 remains silent] What did you feel when you saw it? When you touched it? When its air enveloped around you? Please answer my questions! [SCP -926 remained silent] Fuck! How can we stop this thing?! Tell us now before we all die! We need to know how to stop this thing from getting out and killing everyone on Earth! You were there so tell us now or else we'll kill every single man, woman and child on this planet just so that we can keep them safe from whatever is inside that planet…if they're still alive by then…[Agent was interrupted by Dr. Alfred regarding the next phase in their operation.]<br> Dr. Alfred: We've received an incoming transmission from MTF Omega 7 <i>"Pandora's Box"</i>, they said that they encountered an entity which came out from the center of GPT -288, but it doesn't look like any life form known till now; however one thing is certain about it is that its hostile towards human kind as MTF O7 has lost all contact with them except for one survivor who managed to make his way towards our base camp located near GPT –288; he will be arriving within 3 hours according to his last transmission; I request permission for him to be interrogated immediately once he arrives here and quarantine everything related with Operation Pandora into lock down level 2 (Able). <End Log><br> Closing Statement: The following document will contain information regarding Operation Pandora until further notice as well as information regarding possible containment procedures involving these entities should another one appear again at some point in time within earths orbit or if another planet similar in nature as well as characteristics appears somewhere else within our solar system or even outside our solar system at some point in time….<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9016.2 :</h3><br><br>Sarcastically speaking, we all thought that we could've used the data we collected from <i>SCP-9016</i> and created a new and improved human race by using its DNA to create a superior human being, but what we failed to realize is that it's not the people who are at fault here but instead its their government system which is responsible for this disaster. But I guess it's too late now…<br></div>
