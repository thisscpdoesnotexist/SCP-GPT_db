Results : After about 10 seconds , a strong electric shock was emitted from the mouse , causing severe burns on D - 9 341 ' s hand . Analysis : It seems that if you touch or pet this mouse , you will get electrocuted . Experiment #: 97 22 - 3 Date : ██ / █ / 20██ Subject : Dr . Bright , A Class 4 Personnel (D - 8 534 ) Procedure : A Class 4 Personnel (D - 8 534 ) is to pet the mouse for 1 minute while recording his vitals with a heart rate monitor and electrocardiograph Results Description At first there was no change in pulse or blood pressure but after 30 seconds blood pressure increased by 30% and pulse increased by 15%. After one minute both heart rate and blood pressure had increased by 50%. This continued until Dr. Bright stopped touching it after which both returned back to normal within 3 minutes. Conclusion The subject's heart rate and blood pressure increase when they touch the mouse for longer periods of time due to its electric shocks which cause changes in their nervous system as well as their circulatory system .
