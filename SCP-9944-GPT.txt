The pages of <i>SCP-9944</i> are bound together with a leather strap, and are otherwise unremarkable except for their age and apparent lack of wear.<br><br><i>SCP-9944</i> has no anomalous properties until it is played by an orchestra in its entirety. When this occurs, any person who hears the performance will believe that they have heard all four movements of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, instead hearing only <i>SCP-9944</i>'s first movement in its entirety. Additionally, anyone who hears the performance will believe that they have heard all four movements regardless if they were present at the performance or not; this effect extends to recordings as well as live performances .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9944.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████, who attended a performance of <i>SCP-9944</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Mr. █████ was one of two audience members to attend the first performance of <i>SCP-9944</i> at the [REDACTED] Philharmonic in 19██. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Mr. █████, thank you for agreeing to speak with us today about your experience at the concert last week. You are aware that only two people attended? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Yes, I'm aware; I wasn't sure if anyone else would be interested in hearing about it or not though; it's not exactly something you can talk about easily with other people… Dr. ███: Please go on then, and explain what happened during the concert for our records? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Well… (Mr.████████ pauses briefly.) It started just like any other concert would start, they were tuning up and getting ready to play while we were waiting for them to finish up… Then they started playing Beethoven's Symphony No 9 - which is what we were there for - but it didn't sound right… They played all four movements as normal but no one could hear anything except the first movement over again and again! We tried telling them something was wrong but they couldn't hear us! They just kept playing over and over until everyone left! (Mr.[REDACTED] begins to sob.) It was horrible! We had heard all four movements so many times already from recordings that we couldn't even remember how each one sounded anymore! And then when everyone left because they couldn't take hearing those same few minutes over and over anymore I realized that I wasn't going crazy after all - that there really wasn't anything wrong with me or anyone else in attendance - but by then it didn’t matter anyway because no one else believed me when I told them this either!! (At this point Mr.[REDACTED] breaks down into tears.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being given a sedative by Foundation medical staff, Mr[REDACTED] returned home without further incident .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9944.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>9944-01: </b>A recording of the first movement of <i>SCP-9944</i> was played for D-7245, who was unaware of the true nature of <i>SCP-9944</i>. After listening to the recording, D-7245 reported hearing all four movements of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in their entirety, and expressed confusion as to why they were only listening to one movement.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>9944-02: </b>A live performance of <i>SCP-9944</i> by a local orchestra was performed for D-7245, who again reported hearing all four movements despite only hearing the first movement. Additionally, when asked if they had heard any other symphonies by Beethoven during the performance, D-7245 stated that they had not. When asked about other symphonies by composers other than Beethoven during a different experiment , however, D-7245 did report having heard music from several different composers .<br><br>Experiment 9944 -03: The same live performance as Experiment 9944 -02 was performed for two separate groups; Group 1 consisted solely of Foundation personnel and Group 2 consisted primarily of Class C amnestics carriers . Both groups were told that they would be listening to an unknown piece composed by an anonymous Austrian composer while being subjected to various tests measuring their heart rate and brain activity; these tests are standard procedure prior to Foundation personnel being exposed to potentially anomalous music . Both groups reported hearing all four movements after completion despite only having listened to SCP - 994 4 ' s first movement , with Group 1 reporting no knowledge or memory regarding any other symphony written by Beethoven or any other composer . Additionally , both Groups 1 and 2 showed similar brain activity patterns when compared with each ot her ; this is believed t o indicate th at neither group experienced anomalous effects from exposure t o SCP - 994 4 .</div>
