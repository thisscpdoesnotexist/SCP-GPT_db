How are you feeling today? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10033</i>: </b>I'm doing alright… I was just wondering if you could help me get back to normal again? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Well… We know that your transformation is caused by your gaze turning humans into stone, and we know that it happens because of an anomalous genetic defect in your DNA structure… But we don't know how to fix it yet. It's possible that we never will be able to fix it… You're probably going to have this condition forever now… <i>SCP-10033</i> stares at the doctor silently for several seconds before speaking again in a quiet voice. <br><br><b><i>SCP-10033</i>: </b>So what do I do now? Do I just stay here forever? Dr. █████████ pauses before answering carefully and slowly while looking directly at the subject's eyes (which are no longer capable of petrifying people).<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>No, you don't have to stay here if you don't want too…. You can leave whenever you want too…. But if you leave then we won't be able to help you anymore…. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was concluded, all further attempts by foundation staff members at communication with <i>SCP-10033</i> were met with silence or violence until she eventually stopped responding altogether and refused food for three days before finally dying from starvation on August 15th 20██ .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10033.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10033</i>, D-9341<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is to look into the eyes of <i>SCP-10033</i> for one (1) minute. After this time has passed, he is to be released from her gaze and questioned.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-9341 was unable to move or speak for approximately two (2) minutes after being released from her gaze. When questioned about his condition, he said that he felt as if something was holding him in place. He also reported feeling an <i>"overwhelming sense of peace"</i>, which caused him to feel no pain when a researcher pricked his finger with a needle. When asked if he would like another test run, D-9341 declined and requested termination due to the fact that he could not feel any part of his body below the neck. Test #: 2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10033</i>, Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dr ██████ is to look into the eyes of <i>SCP-10033</i> for one (1) minute while wearing a blindfold over his eyes and earplugs in both ears. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Dr ██████ reported feeling as if someone were touching their fingers together behind their back repeatedly for approximately two (2) minutes after being released from her gaze . No unusual physical symptoms were observed in Dr ██████'s body during or after this test run , however it should be noted that upon questioning , Dr ██████ claimed that they had been able to see perfectly well without their eyes or ears while under the effects of her gaze . Test # 3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>SCP - 100 33 , Researcher Harkness <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher Harkness will look at a picture of himself through a mirror while looking at himself directly through another mirror . This will allow us to determine whether she can affect people who are indirectly looking at her via reflection . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Researcher Harkness became immobilized within seconds after looking into the first mirror . After five minutes had passed , it became clear that there was no way we could release him without breaking our own rules about indirect observation . We broke protocol and looked directly at Researcher Harkness through both mirrors ; once we did so , she immediately regained mobility and began speaking again normally . She claimed not remember anything unusual happening during those five minutes ; however , she did note that there had been some kind of presence with them during those five minutes which they were unable to identify or describe further than <i>"just knowing"</i> it was there with them all along even though they couldn't see it nor hear anything but themselves breathing heavily until we looked directly at them again via both mirrors simultaneously while asking what happened ? Addendum <br><br><b>10033a: </b>On 10/██/20██ , personnel found [DATA EXPUNGED] on floor next door where [DATA EXPUNGED] used as temporary storage space before being moved elsewhere within Site 19 [DATA EXPUNGED].</div>
