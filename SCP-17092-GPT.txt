The locker must be equipped with an automated system that will detect any rat activity and alert personnel immediately.<br><br>Personnel entering the area must wear protective gear and take necessary precautions to avoid contact with <i>SCP-17092</i> or any of the rats it spawns. All specimens spawned by <i>SCP-17092</i> are to be humanely euthanized and disposed of in accordance with standard protocols.<br><br>Any personnel found pressing <i>SCP-17092</i> without authorization will face disciplinary action up to and including termination from the Foundation.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17092</i> is a small, black button with the caption <i>"press for rat"</i> written in white text on its surface. When pressed, a live rat will materialize from thin air and remain in the vicinity of <i>SCP-17092</i> until it is removed or otherwise incapacitated. The rat appears to be an ordinary laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and does not possess any anomalous properties.<br><br>The rats spawned by <i>SCP-17092</i> are capable of surviving indefinitely without food or water, though they appear to require rest as normal animals do. Additionally, no matter how far away from <i>SCP-17092</i> the rats are taken, pressing the button again will cause them to reappear near it within seconds.<br><br>If left unchecked, large numbers of rats can quickly accumulate around <i>SCP-17092</i> due to its ability to continuously spawn new specimens seemingly at random intervals ranging from minutes to hours apart. As such, containment protocols have been established which involve regular removal and humane euthanization of all spawned specimens by personnel wearing protective gear when necessary.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17092.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the upper limit of rats that can be spawned by <i>SCP-17092</i>. After pressing the button for a total of 8 hours, it is estimated that over 10,000 rats had been created. Following this incident, containment protocols were updated to include regular removal and humane euthanization of all specimens spawned by <i>SCP-17092</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17092.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation personnel was interviewed in order to determine the origin of <i>SCP-17092</i>. The subject claimed to have found the button in an abandoned warehouse near [REDACTED], and had no knowledge of its anomalous properties or any other information regarding it.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17092.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/20██ - A test was conducted to determine the effects of pressing <i>SCP-17092</i> multiple times in rapid succession. After pressing the button 10 times within a 5 second period, it is estimated that over 500 rats had been created. Following this incident, containment protocols were updated to include caution when handling <i>SCP-17092</i> due to its potential for rapid population growth.</div>
