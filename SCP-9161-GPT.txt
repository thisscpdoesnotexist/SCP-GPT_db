As such, <i>SCP-9161</i> has been implanted with a chip that sends an electric shock whenever it tries to leave its cell. If <i>SCP-9161</i> fails to obey orders from staff members, or attempts to leave its cell without permission from staff members, the chip will activate and electrocute it.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9161</i> is a green man who can speedrun minecraft. No matter how hard he tries, <i>SCP-9161</i> cannot stop speedrunning minecraft. He will speedrun any version of minecraft that he comes in contact with, which is usually <i>"vanilla"</i>, <i>"forge"</i> and <i>"survival"</i>. <i>SCP-9161</i> has also been seen to spawn items during his gameplays, although it's not known how this happens (please see Addendum 9161-A).<br><br><i>SCP-9160</i> was originally contained at [DATA REDACTED] after being mistaken for anomalous activity in the [DATA REDACTED] server of Minecraft. It was later transferred to Site-[REDACTED], after incident 9160/Alpha when one of the researchers used a cheat code whilst playing with <i>SCP-9160</i>. After this incident, the building containing <i>SCP-9160</i> was incinerated by MTF Delta 6 operatives as per protocol 9991/Alpha following an XK event. The operatives failed to contain <i>SCP-9160</i> on their first attempt due to its anomalous properties and were subsequently killed by it when they tried again on their second attempt; however Dr Awsomelord quickly arrived via helicopter and managed to capture it before more casualties could be sustained on either side. This caused a brief kerfuffle in the O5 council after Dr Awsomelord had reported what happened and recommended demoting him from his position due to extreme recklessness; however they changed their minds when they found out that no additional personnel had been harmed or considered for harm during the entire debacle (it should be noted here that any action against Dr Awsomelord would result in his leaving Foundation custody along with <i>SCP-1040</i>).<br><br>Incident Log 9991/<br>Alpha: On ██/██/████, several members of MTF Delta 6 attempted an assault against <i>SCP-</i>[REDACTED].<br> The assault commenced at 10:45pm local time with operatives Aisaka Yuuki , Vela Antioquia , Carlos Díaz , Ravi Patel , Sgt Johnathan Suggs and Sgt James Pittman approaching from all sides around 2 meters away from its position while shouting obscenities at it like <i>"Hey you!"</i> or <i>"You over there!"</i>.<br> At 10:46pm local time, MTF Delta 6 opened fire upon <i>SCP-</i>[REDACTED] while shouting <i>"Die!"</i>. During this period, several members of staff were injured by friendly fire including Researcher ████ ██████<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9161</i> was recovered after it had been mistaken for an anomalous object in the [DATA REDACTED] server of Minecraft. <i>SCP-9161</i> was originally found during the investigation into incident 9160/Alpha (see Incident Report 9160/Alpha).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9161.1 :</h3><br> Incident Report: 9160/Alpha<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-9161</i> breached containment and caused several casualties within the staff at Site-[REDACTED]. <i>SCP-9161</i> was originally contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. On this day, Researcher [REDACTED] had begun playing with <i>SCP-9161</i> while waiting for it to breach containment. The following conversation is a transcript of Researcher [REDACTED]'s own words.<br><br>[10:45pm] Researcher [REDACTED]: Hey you! Over here!<br><br>[10:46pm]<br> Unknown Entity: Whoa that was close… I wasn't expecting anyone to use the cheat command! But I'm glad you did! It's been so long since someone's used it, I thought all minecrafters had forgotten about me.. how have you been? What's your name? Mine's Xoninne , but my friends call me Ren for short. Or just <i>"mysterious green man who can speedrun minecraft."</i> That name works too if you want it too haha, although most people seem to forget about that one quickly enough…<br><br>Abridged Transcript of Incident 9160/Alpha<br><br><h3>Addendum 9161.2 :</h3><br> Incident Report: 9160/Alpha Continued<br><br>On ██/██/████, MTF Delta 6 opened fire upon <i>SCP-</i>[REDACTED] while shouting <i>"Die!"</i>. During this period, several members of staff were injured by friendly fire including Researcher ████ ██████. <i>SCP-9161</i> then breached containment and proceeded to attack Site-[REDACTED]. It was at this point that Dr Awsomelord arrived via helicopter and captured it using a netgun. The following conversation is a transcript of Dr Awsomelord'<br>s own words:<br><br>[10:47pm]<br> Dr Awsomelord: Crap! There he goes again! We've got to stop him before he causes any more damage!<br><br>[10:48pm]<br> Unknown Entity: Oh hey there doc, didn't see you there… I get it now… You're not an arsonist who likes to cause trouble for the sake of causing trouble? Well that's okay I suppose… Although I have no idea what you're talking about with all this <i>"arsonist"</i> nonsense..?<br><br>Abridged Transcript of Incident 9160/Alpha Continued</div>
