<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27924 is an entity closely resembling an adult male elk (Cervus canadensis), with some significant anomalies in its physiology and behavior. The entity measures approximately 2.5 meters in height at the shoulder and is estimated to weigh 700 kilograms, although its weight appears to fluctuate inexplicably. SCP-27924 exhibits several anomalous properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: SCP-27924 has demonstrated an extraordinarily rapid regenerative ability. Wounds inflicted, including those that would be fatal to non-anomalous elk, heal within moments to minutes without leaving scars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incorporeal Transition</strong>: When threatened or upon receiving damage that would typically be fatal, SCP-27924 is capable of becoming incorporeal for a temporary period, allowing it to pass through solid objects and evade capture or harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Psychic Influence</strong>: Individuals within a radius of approximately 500 meters of SCP-27924 experience an overwhelming compulsion to hunt and kill the entity. These compulsions persist until SCP-27924 is either 'killed' or leaves the affected radius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respawn</strong>: If SCP-27924 is 'killed', it will disappear, and a new identical individual will emerge from the nearest large forested area within 24 to 72 hours. The cycle then begins anew.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite its elusive nature, SCP-27924 has been known to occasionally approach human habitations or show interest in human activity, leading to several containment breaches.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Given SCP-27924's ability to respawn and the psychic influence it exerts over individuals, full containment is not currently possible. The ongoing containment strategy revolves around a task force (codenamed "Hunters of Artemis") trained to track, neutralize, and observe the movements of SCP-27924 to mitigate its potential impact on the civilian population and to prevent unnecessary loss of life.</p>
<p>Containment efforts must be focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rapid response to reports matching SCP-27924's description or effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employing non-lethal means of engagement to avert the entity's defensive incorporeal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring a perimeter is established to keep civilians out of the entity's psychic influence range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracking and exploring any potential patterns in SCP-27924's appearances and behavior to further enhance containment efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigating potential historical and mythological connections that may yield insights into the entity's origins or purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the event of a respawn event, the entity is to be tracked and its new location documented to adjust containment strategies accordingly.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1:</h3>
<h4>Experiment Log 27924-A:</h4>
<p>Multiple experiments have been conducted under various conditions to test the limits of SCP-27924's anomalous abilities:</p>
<h5>Experiment A-1:</h5>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To test the entity's regenerative capabilities.
<strong>Method</strong>: Delivered a superficial wound using a standard-issue combat knife.
<strong>Result</strong>: The wound healed within 15 seconds. SCP-27924 remained calm throughout the process.</p>
<h5>Experiment A-2:</h5>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To test the incorporeal transition under direct threat.
<strong>Method</strong>: Armed confrontation utilizing tranquilizer guns.
<strong>Result</strong>: SCP-27924 became incorporeal upon being hit by a tranquilizer dart, passing through a containment wall and escaping temporary holding. Subsequent observations indicated that SCP-27924 is not affected by conventional sedatives.</p>
<h5>Experiment A-3:</h5>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To test the radius of psychic influence and determine if it varies with intention.
<strong>Method</strong>: Deployed D-Class personnel at varying distances with orders not to harm SCP-27924.
<strong>Result</strong>: Compulsion to hunt SCP-27924 was reported up to 505 meters. Beyond that, the effects tapered off sharply.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2:</h3>
<h4>Incident Report 27924-08:</h4>
<p>An incident occurred on ██/██/20██ in which SCP-27924 appeared within the vicinity of a small town. The entity's psychic influence resulted in multiple civilians engaging in a frenzied hunt. The event resulted in three civilian casualties and the temporary incapacitation of SCP-27924 by law enforcement before it vanished, likely entering an incorporeal state.</p>
<p>Subsequent amnestic treatments were administered to witnesses and local media outlets were provided with a cover story of a tragic hunting accident. Changes in standard operating procedures have since been implemented, and additional efforts have been made to obscure SCP-27924's ties to local folklore to prevent future incidents.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3:</h3>
<h4>Researchers' Notes:</h4>
<p>Several researchers have posited that SCP-27924 may be tied to historical or mythological figures, potentially being a manifestation of a nature deity, spirit of the hunt, or an entity tied to the concept of an eternal chase. Further research is required to determine if these connections hold any relevance to containment or understanding the nature of SCP-27924. Some theories suggest that SCP-27924's presence serves a yet-unknown ecological purpose, requiring a balance that should be maintained rather than disrupted.</p>
