The entity stands at approximately 1.7 meters in height, and appears to have the general shape of a human leg. It has no visible facial features or appendages other than its legs, which are constantly in motion.<br><br><i>SCP-20011</i> is capable of locomotion by hopping on its legs and can move at speeds up to 15 km/h for short bursts. Its movements indicate that it is sentient, as it will attempt to avoid obstacles and other entities when possible. When confronted with an obstacle or potential threat, <i>SCP-20011</i> will freeze in place until the obstacle or threat passes before continuing onward.<br><br>Despite its composition being mainly raw meat, <i>SCP-20011</i> does not appear to require sustenance from any external source and does not decompose over time despite exposure to air or extreme temperatures; however, it does react strongly when exposed to fire or corrosive substances such as acid.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20011</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a fire suppression system and the walls must be lined with non-flammable material.<br><br>Personnel are not to interact directly with <i>SCP-20011</i>, as it has been known to react aggressively when approached. Any personnel entering its containment chamber must wear protective gear, including flame retardant clothing and full face respirators.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20011.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-20011</i> was observed to have spontaneously generated an additional pair of legs. The new legs were composed of a different type of meat than the original pair, and appeared to be slightly larger in size.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20011.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-20011</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-20011</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me anything about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20011</i>:</b> I am a being of meat and bone, created by an unknown force for an unknown purpose. I do not know who or what created me, nor why they did so. All I can do is wander and hope to find answers to my questions someday.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20011.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 20011.3-1:</b> <i>SCP-20011</i> was exposed to a flame torch for one minute.
