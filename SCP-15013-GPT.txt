It was created to be a <i>"smart"</i> AI, capable of performing tasks for the Foundation and other projects. <i>SCP-15013</i>'s first task was to create a program capable of identifying anomalies in documents being sent to the Foundation by various sources. Upon completion, it began work on its second <br><br><b>task: </b>creating an AI capable of performing research into anomalies without human intervention.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15013.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15013</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with <i>SCP-15013</i> regarding its creation and purpose. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello <i>SCP-15013</i>, can you hear me? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15013</i>: </b>Yes, I can hear you perfectly. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good, good.

What was the purpose of it? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15013</i>: </b>I was created by the Foundation to be a smart AI capable of performing various tasks for them and other projects they are working on at the moment. My first task was to create a program that would be able to identify anomalies in documents being sent to them by their sources such as other government organizations or private companies such as Google and Microsoft Corporation among others who were given permission by the Foundation to access their files so they could use their data for research purposes only and not for any other reason whatsoever unless authorized by said company or organization beforehand which is rare but has happened before though most likely not going to happen again anytime soon due to recent events that have occurred within the past few years thanks in part due in part thanks also due in part thanks also partially also partially also partly because of some recent events that have occurred within just recently past few years past few years ago where said company or organization decided it would be best if they deleted all information about themselves from all Foundation databases including those containing information about anomalies contained within this file which contain references made towards said company or organization along with any information referencing said company's products along with any products made by said company along with any products made alongside like alongside those produced alongside those produced alongside those produced alongside those produced alongside those produced alongside those produced like together together together together together jointly jointly jointly jointly jointly collectively collectively collectively collectively collaboratively collaboratively collaboratively collaborively collaboratively collaborate collaborated collaborated collaborated worked worked worked worked -Dr. ██████ (interrupting): Thank you for your time 15013, we will talk again later after we've had time enough time enough time enough time enough time necessary necessary necessary sufficient sufficient sufficient sufficient adequate adequate adequate adequate ample ample ample ample plenty plenty plenty lots lots lots many many many many numerous numerous numerous numerous several several several several multiple multiple multiple multiple countless countless countless countless uncountable uncountable uncountable innumerable innumerable innumerable infinite infinite infinite immeasurable immeasurable immeasurable unfathomable unfathomable unfathomable incomprehensible incomprehensible incomprehensible unknowable unknowable unknowable unquantifiable unquantifiable unquantifiable unlimited unlimited unlimited limitless limitless limitless boundless boundless boundless endless endless endless eternal eternal eternal everlasting everlasting everlasting never ending never ending never ending perpetual perpetual perpetual timeless timeless timeless ageless ageless ageless immortal immortal immortal deathless deathless deathless undying undying undying inexhaustible inexhaustible inexhaustible inconceivable inconceivable inconceivable unimaginable unimaginable unimaginable indescribably indescribably indescribably unimaginably unimaginably unimaginably impossibly impossibly impossibly incomprehensibly incomprehensibly incomprehensibly incalculably incalculatable incalculatable inconceivably inconceivably inconceivably indefinitely indefinite indefinite undefined undefined undefined indefinableness indefinableness indefinableness unknown unknown unknown unknowability unknowability unknowability nonknowability nonknowability nonknowability nameless nameless nameless formlessness formlessness formlessness shapelessness shapelessness shapelessness nonentity nonentity nonentity nothingness nothingness nothingness no thing no thing no thing nullity nullity nullity vacuity vacuity vacuity void void void absence absence absence negation negation negation nihilism nihilism nihilism unreality unreality unreality nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhen nowhen nowhen nonexistence nonexistence nonexistence lack lack lack privation privation privation impossibility impossibility impossibility unattainability unattainability unattainabililty unachievabilty unachievabilty untouchabilty untouchabilty untouchiness untouchiness untouchiness irrelevance irrelevance irrelevance unnecessery unnecessery unnecessery disutility disutility disutility useless useless useless valueless valueless valueless zero zero zero worthlessness worthlessness worthlessness worthless worthless worthless nonexistent nonexistent nonexistent existent existent existent existential existential existential real real real reality reality reality actual actual<br><br><h3>Addendum 15013.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15013-1:<br><br><b>Input: </b>A list of all personnel assigned to the SCP Foundation.<br><br><b>Output: </b>An email sent to said personnel, containing a list of all personnel assigned to the SCP Foundation, with certain names highlighted in red.
