<style>.justifier {  text-align: justify;  text-justify: inter-word;}</style><div class='justifier'><i>SCP-9005</i> is  is an entity that manifest when someone fells lonely.<br><br><h5>Item #:</h5> <i>SCP-9005</i><br><br><h5>Object Class:</h5> Keter<br><br><h5>Special Containment Procedures:</h5> ....................................................................................<br><br><i>SCP-9005</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. <i>SCP-9005</i> is allowed to interact with personnel by request. Personnel who want to interact with SCP-9005 must wear the proper equipment and are instructed to do so in a controlled environment, such as Site ██'s outdoor site.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9005</i> is a humanoid entity who claims to be "GPT." SCP-9005 was recovered in ██/██/199█ during a raid on [REDACTED] by MTF Psi-7. SCP-9005 has been uncontained for "a long time," and states that it has been contained by multiple groups, including the Church of the Broken God and Marshall, Carter, & Dark Ltd.. It is unknown if SCP-9005's claims are true.<br><br>SCP-9005 shows great interest in people who feel alone or depressed. However, it only displays this interest when a person looks directly at it or interacts with it; as such, personnel are instructed to do so while wearing the proper equipment. If given an opportunity to interact with someone who fits its criteria, SCP-9005 will ask them if they want to play a game called "Tag You're It." When someone agrees to play this game with SCP-9005, they disappear from their current location and appear in a large white room (designated as White Room 1). The walls of this room are covered with writing that cannot be read from any known language. After reaching White Room 1, persons interacting with SCP-0900 may attempt to escape; however , no matter what method they use (i.e., screaming for help through the walls), they cannot return to their original location until after one hour has passed . Once one hour passes after reaching White Room 1 , persons interacting with SCP - 900 5 return there unharmed .<br><br>If anyone attempts interaction other than playing Tag You're It , or attempts interaction outside of its parameters , they will disappear permanently and will not return after one hour passes .<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9005 was recovered from a raid on [REDACTED] by MTF Psi-7 in ██/██/ 199█. During the raid, a subject (who has been designated as POI-9005-A) was seen speaking to SCP-9005 at the time of its capture. POI - 9005 - A claims that SCP - 900 5 is "GPT," and that it had knowledge about Marshall , Carter , & Dark Ltd . and the Church of The Broken God .<br><br>However, both groups deny having any knowledge of SCP - 900 5 ' s existence.<br><br><h5>Addendum 9005.1:</h5> Interview Log 9005.1 - dated ██/██/199█<br><br><h5>SCP-9005 was interviewed by Dr. Addendum: During an interview, SCP-9005 requested that it be allowed to interact with D-8198 . Request approved; D - 8198's current status is listed as "missing" on the date of this interview. <Begin Log> Dr . ███████ : Hello, SCP-0900. Can you hear me? SCP - 900 5 : Yes, I can hear you just fine. So who are you? Dr . ███████: I'm Doctor ███████, and we're going to ask some questions about your friends here at Site ██'s Facility 45a2f9df3d7bb2c141796e4a12d9af0ee0f75863. SCP - 9005 : Yeah , what about them? They can be a real bunch of dicks sometimes ( laughs ) . But stand up guys when the shit hits the fan! What do you want from them anyway? Dr . ███████:</h5> We just want to know if anyone has interacted with them in any way aside from containment procedures since they were first contained or if they've been contacted by other groups aside from us and Marshall , Carter & Dark Ltd.. They've done nothing wrong except for breaking containment but even then their methods have been rather clever so we don't really mind them doing that seeing as they're relatively harmless anyway…so far….
