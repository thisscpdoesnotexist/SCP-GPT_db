It is a white staircase with a height of about 1 meter, and the width of about 4 meters. The stairs are made out of concrete, and it appears to be in a building somewhere.<br><br><i>SCP-15687</i> was discovered by Dr. ████████ on █/██/19██ when he was walking home from work late at night after being asked to check up on SCP-████, which was in the same building as <i>SCP-15687</i> at the time. He stumbled upon what he thought to be an ordinary staircase for some reason, so he decided to climb it just for funsies (he had been working long hours lately). Once he reached the top step though, there were more steps leading down instead of up like you would expect from an ordinary staircase… So he kept climbing down them until they ended abruptly with no wall or floor behind him… He then fell through what appeared to be nothingness for approximately 3 minutes before landing on his feet again next to SCP-████'s containment chamber door whereupon he promptly fainted due to exhaustion (he had been working long hours lately).<br><br>When Dr. ████████ woke up again later that day after being carried back into Site 19 by several other researchers who were passing by while carrying out their daily duties (he had been working long hours lately), the first thing that came into his mind when regaining consciousness was <i>"What did I just do?"</i>. After checking his surroundings and finding himself inside Site 19's medical bay whereupon he promptly fainted again due to exhaustion (he had been working long hours lately), Dr. ████████ decided not mention anything about what happened earlier that day when questioned by any personnel regarding why exactly did he faint twice within such close proximity of each other… And thus started rumors regarding how Dr. ████████ apparently has narcolepsy or something like that because nobody believed him anyway so why even bother telling them?<br><br><h3>Addendum 15687.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Researcher █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was recorded on the day of discovery of <i>SCP-15687</i>, and was conducted by Researcher █████████ who had been assigned to help Dr. ████████ in his research regarding <i>SCP-15687</i> at the time. <Begin Log, [00:24]> Researcher <br><br><b>█████████: </b>So… What exactly happened earlier today? <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Well… I was just walking home from work late at night after being asked to check up on SCP-████ which was in the same building as this staircase for some reason (he had been working long hours lately). I stumbled upon what I thought to be an ordinary staircase for some reason so I decided to climb it just for funsies (he had been working long hours lately). Once I reached the top step though, there were more steps leading down instead of up like you would expect from an ordinary staircase… So I kept climbing down them until they ended abruptly with no wall or floor behind me… And then suddenly my vision turned black and everything went dark for a moment before falling through what appeared to be nothingness for approximately 3 minutes before landing on my feet again next to SCP-████'s containment chamber door whereupon I promptly fainted due to exhaustion (he had been working long hours lately). When did you wake up again? <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>About 15 minutes later when several other researchers who were passing by while carrying out their daily duties decided that they should carry me back into Site 19 because apparently they thought that it would make them look good if they could bring back a researcher who fainted twice within such close proximity of each other into Site 19's medical bay whereupon they promptly carried me inside here and left without saying anything else afterwards since nobody believed me anyway so why even bother telling them? <End Log, [00:28]> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing all available information regarding this incident, it has come into our attention that we have discovered another anomalous object within Site 19's premises which is not related in any way whatsoever with any known anomalies found within our database thus far! Let us hope that we can contain this new anomaly soon enough before anyone else stumbles upon it! – Head Administrator Aelius<br><br><h3>Addendum 15687.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9341<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is to climb <i>SCP-15687</i> and report what he sees.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-9341 climbed the staircase, and reported that it was an ordinary staircase with concrete stairs, just like how it looked like before he climbed it. He then descended the staircase again, and reported that there were still more steps leading down instead of up like you would expect from an ordinary staircase… So he kept climbing down them until they ended abruptly with no wall or floor behind him… He then fell through what appeared to be nothingness for approximately 3 minutes before landing on his feet again next to SCP-████'s containment chamber door whereupon he promptly fainted due to exhaustion (he had been working long hours lately).<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-15687</i> is indeed not infinite after all. - Dr. ████████</div>
