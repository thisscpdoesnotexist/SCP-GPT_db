All experiments have concluded that SCP-19606 does not exist.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19606<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19606</i> is a gray metal cube that does not physically exist. All attempts to locate or measure the object have failed, including all forms of scanning and imaging. Despite its lack of physicality, <i>SCP-19606</i> has been observed to interact with its environment in various ways.<br><br>When placed within an enclosed space, such as a room or container, <i>SCP-19606</i> will cause objects within the space to move randomly and erratically. This movement appears to be random and unpredictable, but is always directed away from the cube itself. Objects affected by this phenomenon will often collide with each other or other objects in the area before coming to rest again.<br><br>In addition, when placed near living organisms (including humans), <i>SCP-19606</i> will cause them to experience feelings of dread and unease which increase in intensity over time if they remain near it for extended periods of time. Subjects have reported feeling as though something was watching them from inside the cube despite its lack of physical presence and being unable to look away from it even when instructed otherwise.<br><br>The source of these phenomena remains unknown at this time; however research into possible causes is ongoing<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19606</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times. All personnel are to remain at least 10 meters away from the object when it is not being tested or observed. Any personnel who experience symptoms of distress while near <i>SCP-19606</i> must immediately report this to their supervisor and seek medical attention if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19606.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred in which <i>SCP-19606</i> was released into the facility. All personnel within the area were immediately evacuated and all exits leading to the facility were sealed off. After several hours of searching, <i>SCP-19606</i> could not be found and it is believed that it left the facility during this time. No further incidents have been reported since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19606.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Dr. ████████, lead researcher on <i>SCP-19606</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Researcher ████████<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Researcher ████████:</b> So, Doctor ████████, can you tell us a bit about your research into <i>SCP-19606</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Of course. We've been studying the object since it was first discovered and have made some interesting findings. As you know, it doesn't physically exist but still interacts with its environment in various ways. We believe that this is due to some kind of energy field or force emanating from the cube which causes objects to move and living organisms to experience feelings of dread and unease when they are near it. We're still trying to understand exactly how this works but we're making progress.<br><b><br>Researcher ████████:</b> Interesting. Do you have any theories as to why it behaves this way?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> We're not sure yet, but we believe that the cube may be some kind of gateway or portal to another dimension or reality. It could be that whatever is on the other side is causing these effects in our world. We're still investigating and looking into possible explanations but there's no definitive answer yet.<br><b><br>Researcher ████████:</b> I see. Thank you for your time, Doctor ████████.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 19606.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 19606.3-1:</b> An enclosed room was set up with <i>SCP-19606</i> at its center, and various objects were placed within the space. After five minutes of observation, it was noted that all objects had begun to move erratically away from the cube. The movement ceased after 15 minutes and all objects returned to their original positions.<br><b><br>Experiment Log 19606.3-2:</b> A single human subject was instructed to enter the same room as before and observe <i>SCP-19606</i> for 10 minutes. During this time, the subject reported feeling increasingly uneasy and unable to look away from the object despite being instructed otherwise by researchers present in the room. After 10 minutes, they were removed from the room and reported feeling relieved upon leaving it behind them</div>
