Harrison </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Dr. Harrison had interviewed the director of Godzilla (1998) and the 1998 American remake of Godzilla, ██████ ██████, to try to find out how he had stopped <i>SCP-16897</i> from attacking his studio. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Harrison: </b>Hello Mr. ██████████, I am here to ask you some questions about your encounter with <i>SCP-16897</i> on █/██/20██ Dr. Harrison shows a picture of <i>SCP-16897</i> taken during its attack on the Japanese movie studio of ██████████ ████████ on a computer screen in front of Mr. ██████████<br><br><b>Mr. [REDACTED]: </b>Oh yeah, that thing! How did you know?<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>.Harrison: </b>We found several pictures taken by one of your workers before they were killed by it<br><br>Mr <br><br><b>.[REDACTED]: </b>Oh god… That was a helluva day… So anyway what do you want to know?<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>.Harrison: </b>Could you describe the events leading up to your encounter with it? <br><br><b>Mr.[REDACTED]: </b>Well we were filming a scene for our new movie when suddenly all our cameras started showing an image that looked like this [shows picture] and then we heard this loud roar coming from outside! I looked out my window and saw something that looked like this [shows picture] but much bigger! It was destroying everything in its path as it made its way towards us! And then I remembered seeing something about these things when I was younger so I told everyone in my studio to run for their lives while I tried distracting it with one last shot before running away myself… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further research into Mr.[REDACTED]'s background, Foundation personnel discovered that he had been born in Japan where he would have been exposed at an early age to Japanese monster movies such as Godzilla (1998). This could explain why only his studio was affected by <i>SCP-16897</i>'s attack instead of other studios nearby which were also making movies featuring monsters similar to those seen in Godzilla (1998).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16897.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 16897-1<br><br>Test <br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-16897</i>-A, a godzilla kaiju suit.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-16897</i>-A is to be placed in a room with the 1998 American remake of Godzilla and the 1998 Japanese version of Godzilla (titled <i>"Godzilla"</i>).<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-16897</i> did not attack either movie.<br><br><b>Notes: </b>I think we can conclude that only the original Japanese version of Godzilla is able to stop them - Dr. ██████</div>
