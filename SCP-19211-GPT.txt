The recipe contains instructions for the preparation of a dish composed of cod, lye, and other ingredients.<br><br>When <i>SCP-19211</i> is prepared according to its instructions, it results in an anomalous entity (referred to hereafter as <i>SCP-19211</i>-1) that appears to be composed of various organic and inorganic materials. Analysis has revealed that these components include human DNA, metal alloys, and unknown compounds believed to be related to lye.<br><br><i>SCP-19211</i>-1 displays an array of anomalous properties which make it highly dangerous: It can rapidly alter its physical form and composition; manipulate matter on a molecular level; generate powerful electromagnetic fields; create localized gravitational anomalies; produce intense heat or cold temperatures; emit radiation at hazardous levels; and cause extreme pain or death when exposed directly to living organisms.<br><br>In addition, if allowed access to an area with sufficient resources (such as electricity), <i>SCP-19211</i> will attempt to replicate itself by consuming nearby organic material before dispersing into multiple copies of itself across the area. These copies are capable of independent thought processes similar in complexity those seen in humans or animals. They will often display hostile behavior towards any living organism they encounter unless provided with additional sustenance from external sources such as foodstuffs or energy sources like electricity or fuel cells. If not contained quickly enough this could lead potentially lead to XK class End Of The World Scenario due the sheer number of replicating entities created by SCP 19211 .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-19211</i> is to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Access to the item is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. All attempts to prepare <i>SCP-19211</i> must be approved by the Site Director and conducted under strict supervision of two (2) security personnel.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-19211</i> is prepared, all personnel present are required to wear full hazmat suits and remain at least five (5) meters away from <i>SCP-19211</i> at all times. If any anomalous activity occurs, personnel are instructed to immediately evacuate the area and contact onsite security for further instructions. Any instances of <i>SCP-19211</i> created during testing must be contained using standard hazardous material protocols before being<br><br><h3> Addendum 19211.1: </h3><br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-19211</i> is prepared, personnel are instructed to immediately terminate all copies of <i>SCP-19211</i>-1 and contain any remaining components for further study. If possible, personnel are also advised to collect samples of the original ingredients used in preparation as well as any residual material from the cooking process.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19211.2: </h3> Interview with Grandma<br><br>On ██/██/████, a member of the research team conducted an interview with Grandma, the original creator of <i>SCP-19211</i>. The following is an excerpt from that interview:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> So, you created this recipe? How did it come about?<br><b><br>Grandma:</b> Oh, it was just something I threw together one day when I was feeling adventurous. It seemed to turn out alright so I kept making it for special occasions. Never had any idea what kind of trouble it could cause!<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Do you know what the ingredients are?<br><b><br>Grandma:</b> Well, I always start with cod. Then I add lye and some other things to give it a bit of flavor. It's not an exact science, so sometimes I just throw in whatever I have on hand.<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Do you know what the lye does?<br><b><br>Grandma:</b> Not really, no. I just know it helps to make the dish a bit more… interesting.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19211.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 19211-1<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-19211</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-19211</i> was prepared according to its instructions and placed in a sealed containment chamber. The chamber was then monitored for any anomalous activity.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After approximately 5 minutes, the interior of the containment chamber began to rapidly heat up. Within 10 seconds of this, a humanoid entity (designated <i>SCP-19211</i>-1) manifested within the room. It quickly began attacking personnel present before being contained by onsite security personnel using standard hazardous material protocols.</div>
