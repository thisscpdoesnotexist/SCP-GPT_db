Testing of <i>SCP-16937</i> is currently prohibited.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16937</i> is a TV channel that manifests anomalies at night or the evening, mostly between 6PM and 5AM. <i>SCP-16937</i> was discovered in ████, Germany by Agent ██████ who was investigating reports of an <i>"unusual TV channel"</i>. It is currently unknown how <i>SCP-16937</i> manifested itself.<br><br><i>SCP-16937</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is watched on a television set between 6PM and 5AM. During this time, the viewer will experience a hallucination which consists of them being able to see through solid matter for approximately 1 minute after watching <i>SCP-16937</i> for 10 seconds. This effect only occurs once per night, but can be repeated if the viewer watches <i>SCP-16937</i> again before 5AM. The hallucinations experienced are unique to each individual viewer; however, all viewers have reported seeing <i>"something"</i> moving around near them despite not being able to see it clearly (see Test Log 16937-1). Viewers also report hearing whispers during their hallucinations; these whispers are always in German regardless of whether or not the viewer speaks German (see Test Log 16937-2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16937.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████ (<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ███)<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████, a resident of ████, Germany who first discovered <i>SCP-16937</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on the day that <i>SCP-16937</i> was discovered by Agent ██████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello Mr. [REDACTED], how are you? <br><br><b>Mr. [REDACTED]: </b>I'm fine, thank you for asking Doctor… What do you want to talk about? Dr. ███: We're here to ask you some questions about this <i>"unusual TV channel"</i> that you reported yesterday… <br><br><b>Mr. [REDACTED]: </b>Oh yes! I forgot all about it! It's been so busy with work lately… Anyway, what did it look like? Was it just static or something like that?<br><br>Dr. ███ pauses for a moment before responding<br><br>Dr.: No… It looked like an ordinary TV channel but there were no commercials and the shows were different from what is currently airing in Germany…. How did this happen exactly? You said that you watched the channel for 10 seconds before experiencing hallucinations correct? Mr.: Yes, I was watching TV as always when suddenly this <i>"unusual channel"</i> appeared on my screen; I thought nothing of it at first but then after watching it for 10 seconds I started seeing things moving around near me despite not being able to see them clearly due to their size and shape being distorted by whatever anomaly is causing this effect; then these whispers started coming out of nowhere too and they were speaking German even though none of us in my family speak German so we don't know what they said exactly… After experiencing all of those things I turned off the TV immediately and called the police since we live in Germany after all and if there's anything dangerous happening here they should be notified immediately right?! They told me to call back if anything else happens though so hopefully nothing does happen now because we've already had enough problems with other anomalies appearing here recently…<br><br>Dr.: Okay okay calm down sir everything will be okay now; we'll make sure your family won't have any more problems with anomalies appearing around here anymore alright?! Now tell me more about these whispers please…. Did they sound human or animalistic perhaps?? Or maybe even robotic?? Mr.: Well uhh.. They didn't really sound human or animalistic per se but rather computerized almost like a voice synthesizer program would sound if someone used one while talking through an old phone line…. But yeah definitely computerized!! And also robotic sounding as well!! So yeah pretty much both!!<br><br>Dr.: Thank you very much sir your information has been very helpful today! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Further interviews revealed no new information regarding <i>SCP-16937</i>'s source or purpose; however, research into similar phenomena is ongoing at Site-17 under Project Blackout .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16937.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Test Log 16937-1 - Test Log 16937-1 Experiment #: 16937-01<br><br>Subject(s): D-1678, a 38 year old male of German descent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-1678 is instructed to watch <i>SCP-16937</i> for 10 seconds. After he has done so, he is to write down what he experienced. D-1678 does this and waits in his room until 5AM. After the time has passed, D-1678 will be escorted back into the observation chamber and asked to describe what happened during his hallucination again. <br><br><b>Results: </b>During his first hallucination, D-1678 reported seeing <i>"a big black… something"</i> moving around near him at an approximate distance of 2 meters from him that was <i>"all blurry"</i>. He also reported hearing whispering which sounded like it was coming from all directions; however, he could not understand what it said because it was too quiet for him to hear clearly (see Addendum 16937.4). When asked about these things during his second hallucination at 5AM, D-1678 said that nothing had changed since last time other than the whispers being louder than before; however, they still sounded like they were coming from all directions (see Addendum 16937.5). Experiment #: 16937 - 02 Subject(s): Researcher ████ ██████ , a 32 year old male of German descent who speaks fluent German but cannot read or write it well enough to understand SCP -169 37's subtitles . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher ████ is instructed to watch SCP -169 37 between 6PM and 7PM on a TV set in one of Site -19 's common areas with the volume muted . After watching for 10 seconds , Researcher ████ is then instructed t o describe anything unusual that occurs . <br><br><b>Results: </b>[ REDACTED ] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] Subsequent experiments involving non-[REDACTED] personnel are prohibited by order of O5 Command . Experiment #: 16 9 37 – 03 Subject(s): Agent ███████ , a 35 year old female whose native language is English but who speaks fluent German as well . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Agent ███████ watches SCP –169 37 between 6 PM and 7 PM on her personal laptop computer while sitting in her living room at home with the volume muted . She then writes down anything she experiences while watching before going back into her bedroom until 5 AM arrives ; she will then return back into the living room where she watched SCP –169 37 and describe anything unusual that occurs again after waiting until 7 AM passes by . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Agent ███████ reports seeing <i>"a tall man"</i> standing next to her bed while watching through her laptop computer's webcam ; however , when asked how tall this figure was , she says that its height seemed impossible since its head reached up towards the ceiling even though its body only reached up halfway through hers ( see Figu re 1 ).
