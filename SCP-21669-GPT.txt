Upon exposure, subjects will immediately stop breathing and will be unable to resume on their own. Subjects affected by this effect can only be resuscitated through artificial respiration or other medical intervention.<br><br>The phrase <i>"breathe manually"</i> does not need to be spoken aloud in order for the effect to take place; it has been observed that merely reading or hearing the phrase is enough for subjects to become affected. The exact method of transmission is currently unknown, however, it appears that any form of media containing the phrase can cause infection.<br><br>Once infected with <i>SCP-21669</i>, there is no known cure or treatment available and all attempts at reversing its effects have failed thus far. As such, containment protocols are focused on preventing further spread of <i>SCP-21669</i> rather than attempting a cure. All forms of media containing the phrase are confiscated as soon as possible and destroyed before they can reach a wider audience. Any personnel who come into contact with these materials must undergo immediate amnestic treatment in order to prevent further spread of infection<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> All forms of media containing the phrase <i>"breathe manually"</i> are to be confiscated and destroyed as soon as possible. Any personnel who come into contact with these materials must undergo immediate amnestic treatment in order to prevent further spread of infection.<br><br>In addition, all personnel exposed to <i>SCP-21669</i> are to be monitored for any signs or symptoms of infection and immediately isolated if any such signs are observed. Personnel showing symptoms must remain in isolation until they can be treated with medical intervention or until the effects have worn off on their own.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21669.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to create an antidote for <i>SCP-21669</i> by exposing infected personnel to the phrase <i>"breathe normally"</i>. However, this attempt was unsuccessful and all subjects remained in their affected state.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21669.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21669</i>-A<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21669</i>-A, a 32 year old male who was exposed to the phrase <i>"breathe manually"</i> during an online discussion.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Doctor ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Can you tell me what happened when you heard the phrase?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21669</i>-A:</b> I suddenly stopped breathing and couldn't start again on my own.
