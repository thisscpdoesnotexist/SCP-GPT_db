It's my masterpiece! The sharpest sword in existence! <br><br><b>Dr.████: </b>How did you make it? What materials did you use?<br><br><b>████████: </b>Well…I used a piece of reality as a base material and then added some other stuff to it and then I added some more stuff to that and then I added even more stuff on top of that and then I finally finished it by adding even more stuff on top of all that other stuff…and then I sharpened it with this super-sharp thingy that was also made out of reality or something like that…I don't really remember how exactly but yeah, basically what you need is a lot of reality in order to make this thing work properly, otherwise there will be holes in the fabric or whatever you want to call it so yeah, just get as much reality as possible if you want your own katana like mine here~ <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing about 9920's construction process, research into using <i>SCP-1425</i> as an alternative method for creating 9920 has been authorized by O5 command under Project 1425-A7 (See Addendum 1425).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9920.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 9920-1 - Close Experiment Log 9920-1 Test #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2514, a level 2 researcher.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is told to cut through a piece of paper with <i>SCP-9920</i>. Subject does so without difficulty. Paper is then sent to Dr. █████ for testing and analysis. Results show the paper was cut exactly in half, as if it had been done with an extremely sharp blade. Test #: 2<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2514, same as before. Subject is told to cut through a steel plate that has been reinforced with titanium plating several times over in order to make it stronger than any known material on earth at the time of testing (Titanium steel alloy). Steel plate was also coated in rubber for protection against slippage during testing and analysis of results by Dr ██████ Results show that the subject did not even attempt to swing at the steel plate when instructed, instead just staring at it while holding <i>SCP-9920</i> by its hilt until he was instructed otherwise by Dr ██████ After this test <i>SCP-9920</i> showed no signs of wear or damage whatsoever despite being used against an object far stronger than anything else on earth prior to this experiment (see attached photo). Test #3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2514, same as before <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous test except after being instructed otherwise subject is told to stab into the center of a 5 cm thick block of solid concrete using only <i>SCP-9920</i>'s tip . <br><br><b>Result: </b>Upon contact between blade and concrete block subject recoils slightly before swinging down hard onto concrete block causing it crack down the middle from top to bottom but failing completely at cutting through or damaging said concrete block in any way whatsoever despite being swung down with all his might upon said concrete block . Note From Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b><i>"I'm starting think we're missing something here."</i><br><br></div>
