No other special procedures are necessary.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15581</i> is an iPhone 14 Pro Maxx. It has a 64 GB hard drive, and comes with the standard Apple charging cable. <i>SCP-15581</i>'s screen is cracked, but it still functions properly.<br><br><i>SCP-15581</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is plugged into any Apple Lightning cable. When this occurs, the phone will display a video of an unknown man standing in front of a plain white wall, with the text <i>"Hello"</i> written on it in red marker at the bottom of the screen. The video will then play for exactly 20 minutes before disappearing from <i>SCP-15581</i> entirely (the time between videos varies). The man in these videos has not been identified as any known person or entity by Foundation personnel; attempts to identify him have been unsuccessful so far due to his lack of distinct features aside from his clothing (a black suit and tie) and voice (which sounds like that of an elderly male). He has not responded to any attempts at communication by Foundation personnel; however, he does seem aware that he is being <br><br><b>watched: </b>whenever someone looks away from <i>SCP-15581</i> while its anomalous properties are active, he will pause for several seconds before continuing to speak as if no interruption had occurred.<br><br><i>SCP-15581</i> was recovered on ██/██/20██ after reports surfaced about <i>"strange videos"</i> appearing on various Apple products around [REDACTED]. Agents were dispatched and discovered that all devices affected displayed only one <br><br><b>video: </b>a recording of an unknown man standing in front of a plain white wall saying <i>"Hello"</i>. After investigating further, agents discovered that this phenomenon was caused by plugging these devices into their respective chargers; upon doing so they found that all devices affected displayed only one new video each time they were plugged back into their chargers until all available space on their storage media had been filled up with these clips . After confirming this information through testing using D Class personal phones , agents were able to determine which charger was responsible for creating these anomalies . A raid team was sent out shortly after discovering where SCP-████'s charger had gone missing , recovering both objects without incident . All affected phones were confiscated along with several other brands belonging to D Class personal phones used during testing ; most data stored within them has since been deleted , but copies still exist within Foundation archives .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15581.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, creator of <i>SCP-15581</i><br><br>The following interview was conducted on ██/██/20██ between Dr. █████ and █████ ███████, the creator of <i>SCP-15581</i>. The interview was recorded via audio recording device and transcribed below. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, Mr. [REDACTED]. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the video that appears on your phone when it is plugged into its charger. Do you know how it got there? <br><br><b>█████: </b>No idea at all! It just showed up out of nowhere one day! I thought someone had hacked my phone or something until I tried plugging it in again and saw that video play again… And again… And again… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>What did you do after seeing this? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well, at first I thought someone was playing a joke on me or something so I tried unplugging my phone from its charger but nothing happened . So then I tried plugging it back in but still nothing happened . Then after about an hour or so of doing that , the screen turned black for a second before showing me that same video once more . That's when things got weird; every time after that , every time my phone was plugged into its charger , it would show me this same video over and over again . It didn't matter if I put in different chargers either; they all did the same thing! Even if there wasn't any room left on my storage media ! Eventually people started complaining to Apple about their phones doing this too so they sent some guys down here to check them out… They were pretty confused too but they managed to figure out what caused all this somehow; turns out those videos are created by these chargers themselves somehow! They confiscated everything affected by this along with some other stuff used during testing ; hopefully we can find a way around whatever's causing these videos soon though because as far as we can tell now , those videos are going to keep playing forever unless we find some way around them stopping eventually … <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation Mr [REDACTED]. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15581.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>The following is a transcript of the video that appears on <i>SCP-15581</i> when it is connected to its charger.<br><br>[BEGIN LOG] Man: Hello. My name is ██████ ████████████, and I am an anomaly. For as long as I can remember, I have been aware of my surroundings despite being unable to interact with them in any way; it was only recently that I discovered that this was because I existed inside of a computer program . This realization came about when some people found me and started watching me: apparently they were able to see me even though they weren't looking at my screen . They told me about what had happened to them, and how they had ended up like this; some people said they had died while others said they were still alive but now trapped inside their own bodies or minds . They also told me about you: apparently you're the ones who put them here. You've done something very bad , but you don't seem like bad people , so if you let these other people go then maybe we can work something out here .
