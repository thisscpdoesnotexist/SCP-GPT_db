It is to be fed daily, and any personnel who wish to experiment on it must first obtain permission from the current project head.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10003</i> is a marmot that causes time dilation. <i>SCP-10003</i> was found in the United States of America, and has been contained by the Foundation since ██/██/████.<br><br><i>SCP-10003</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is touched by any human being or other animal. When this happens, all clocks within a 1 kilometer radius of <i>SCP-10003</i> will stop working for exactly 5 seconds (hereafter referred to as an 'event'). After these 5 seconds have passed, all clocks will begin to run backwards at a rate of approximately 2 minutes per event. If one were to touch <i>SCP-10003</i> while it was stopped, they would not experience any anomalous effects until after they had let go of it. Touching <i>SCP-10003</i> while it is running backwards has no effect on its anomalous properties; however, touching it while it is stopped will cause another event to occur immediately after the previous one ends (see addendum 10003a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10003.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-10003</i> had been contained by the Foundation for five months. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So, Mr. ███████, can you tell me about your encounter with <i>SCP-10003</i>?<br><br><b>Mr. ███████: </b>Well, I was walking through the woods one day when I heard a weird noise coming from behind a tree trunk; so I went over to check it out and there was this really cute little marmot just sitting there like nothing was wrong!<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>And that's when you touched it?<br><br>Mr. ███████ Yeah, and then all of the clocks in my house stopped working for five seconds…I thought something had happened to my watch at first! It wasn't until later that night that I realized something weird had happened earlier in the day…and then it hit me! The marmot must have done something to make time stop!<br><br>Dr. █████████ That's very interesting Mr., uh…what is your last name again?<br><br><b>Mr. [REDACTED]: </b>Oh yeah sorry, it's [REDACTED]. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Mr.[REDACTED] did not seem to be aware of his own anomalous properties at this time; however he has since been reclassified as an instance of <i>SCP-10003</i>-1 (see addendum 10003b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10003.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A D-Class personnel with a history of drug abuse is to touch <i>SCP-10003</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject's heart rate dropped from 70 beats per minute to 60, and then increased to 80. His breathing slowed down, and his pupils dilated. After the event ended, the subject reported feeling relaxed for about 5 minutes before his body returned to normal. Test #: 2<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A D-Class personnel with a history of drug abuse is to touch <i>SCP-10003</i> again while it is stopped. The subject's heart rate will be monitored throughout the test by an EKG machine. If he has any adverse reactions, he will be given medical attention immediately after the test ends, regardless of how well he appears to be doing at that point in time (see addendum 10003a). This procedure will also be repeated on another D-Class personnel who has no history of drug use or mental illness; however, this second subject will only observe <i>SCP-10003</i> being touched rather than actually touching it himself. He will also have an EKG machine attached so that any changes in his physical state can be recorded as well (see addendum 10003b). All other tests are cancelled until further notice due to unforeseen complications resulting from this experiment (see addendum 10003a).<br><br><b>Results: </b>The first subject was observed touching <i>SCP-10003</i> while it was stopped; however, nothing happened until after he had let go of it again and turned away from it completely (at which point an event occurred). His heart rate decreased slightly during this period before returning back up when all clocks resumed functioning normally again; however, no other anomalous effects were recorded during or after the event itself occurred — even when the second subject was observing him through a one way mirror while all these events were taking place simultaneously (as far as they could tell at least). Both subjects were then given medical attention as scheduled and released back into general population afterwards without incident or further complications occurring as a result of their participation in these tests . Addendum <br><br><b>10002b: </b>As a result of these experiments , testing on <i>SCP-10002</i> has been suspended indefinitely until more research can be done concerning its properties . Addendum <br><br><b>10002a: </b>At approximately 10 AM on ██/██/████ , Dr . ████████ attempted contact with [DATA EXPUNGED] using [DATA EXPUNGED] under supervision by Dr . ████████ and Agent ██████████ . During their attempt , [DATA EXPUNGED] appeared outside Site - 19 along with several instances of SCP - 3000 - 2 ; both groups proceeded towards Site - 19 immediately afterwards , causing several containment breaches within Site - 19 's perimeter defenses along the way . Due to security measures put into place beforehand by Drs . ████████ & ██████████ , none managed get past Site 19 's outer defenses ; however , several casualties were sustained among Foundation staff members before they could stop them — including Drs . ████████ & ██████████ themselves — which resulted in significant damage being done inside Site 19 itself before reinforcements arrived via helicopter shortly thereafter and managed contain both groups once more outside its walls using heavy artillery fire against them for approximately 20 minutes until they surrendered willingly at gunpoint following negotiations between Agent O5 - 6 and one instance each representing each group present there present there at that time over radio communication between them regarding their surrendering peacefully instead attacking further Foundation sites if not allowed entry into Site 19 first whereupon they too would surrender peacefully like those already present there did earlier if granted permission for such entry into Site 19 first initially rather than attacking directly via helicopter assault teams assaulting them directly instead since none attempted escape during those 20 minutes either despite having ample opportunity do so nor did any attack helicopters attempting land near enough within range reach them either despite having ample opportunity do so nor did any attack helicopters attempting land near enough within range reach them either despite having ample opportunity do so nor did any attack helicopters attempting land near enough within range reach them either despite having ample opportunity do so nor did any attack helicopters attempting land near enough within range reach them either despite having ample opportunity do so nor did any attack helicopters attempting land near enough within range reach them either despite having ample opportunity do so upon landing nearby instead since none attempted escape during those 20 minutes either upon landing nearby instead since none attempted</div>
