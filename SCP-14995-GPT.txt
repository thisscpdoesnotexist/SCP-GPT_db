I would like to ask you some questions about your son, █████████. <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Sure thing doc, he's a good kid but he has his problems sometimes… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>What kind of problems? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>He has been having trouble in school recently and is getting into fights with other kids at his age group… But that isn't what worries me the most… He seems to have developed an obsession with death lately… He keeps asking me if I'm going to die soon and if my wife will die too when she gets older… It's really starting to scare me doctor! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>That is very concerning indeed! Do you know where he got these ideas from? Mr.: Well we do watch a lot of TV shows about crime and stuff like that so maybe it's something he saw there? Dr.: Hmm maybe so but this could be serious! Can you tell me more about your son? How did his obsession develop exactly? Mr.: Well it all started when we were on a vacation in Paris last month for my wife's birthday, we went sightseeing around the city and visited the Eiffel tower where our son disappeared for almost an hour while we were looking at some art or something like that; then suddenly out of nowhere he just appears again as if nothing happened! We asked him where had he been but all he said was <i>"I looked behind"</i> then started crying hysterically until we took him home; then later on that night after dinner things got even stranger… My wife had bought us tickets for a play at one of those fancy theaters over there called <i>"theatre du soleil"</i> which apparently was really popular among tourists because it had sold out weeks ago so i'm not sure how she managed to get tickets without any hassle anyway while i was still trying to figure out how she did it she told me they were standing room only tickets which meant that our seats would be somewhere in the back row next to each other just behind everyone else who bought regular seats; now i don't know if you've ever seen this theater before but its pretty small compared ot most places over there so basically everyone who bought regular seats would have their heads sticking up above us since they would be sitting down while my family and i are standing up throughout the entire performance; well anyways after buying those tickets somehow or another vernon found himself alone with us again during dinner time saying things like <i>"i'll look behind"</i> or <i>"i'll see them soon"</i> etcetera etcetera until finally my daughter lost her temper telling him off by saying something along the lines of <i>"you're such a freak!"</i> which made him cry again forcing both her mother and myself into comforting him once more before taking our seats inside teh theater itself; this time however instead of crying hysterically as usual Vernon kept repeating two words over and over again until eventually falling asleep right before teh show began afterwards everything seemed normal enough aside from Vernon being unusually quiet although whenever anyone tried talking with him during intermission all they received in response was either silence or strange sounds coming from his mouth every now and then <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing security footage taken during <i>SCP-14995</i>-2 event (See Addendum 14995-3) Doctor J██ offered no further questioning regarding <i>SCP-14995</i> due its highly sensitive nature instead recommending immediate termination due potential risk posed towards civilians involved .
