SCP-XXXX-1: What am I doing here Doctor? Why did they capture me and my friends? Dr. ████: They captured you because you where living in an office building which was scheduled to be demolished and destroyed as part of a redevelopment project, in other words they were going to destroy your home, there fore we decided to buy the building instead and house you in it along with other homeless individuals who live there.

Are they your creations or were they brought here by someone else from somewhere else , tell me everything !<br><br>[At this point subject appears distressed.]<br><br><br>I didn't bring them here Doctor ! They came through themselves!<br><br><br>How did they appear before coming through ??<br><br><br>I don't know how !! All I know is that one day when my friend was sitting next to one of the computers working on something strange she saw something moving inside him…something she had never seen before…and then he grew up..then more and more started appearing till we couldn't count them anymore ..and then finally many days later a lot more appeared …they were everywhere around us…we ran away from our old office space as fast as possible but somehow some got left behind …and so back then most people thought it was just some new kind of animal species..but now almost 10 years later we have discovered much more about their origin than before ..but unfortunately no one believed us when telling others what had happened back then….dozens upon dozens fled away each day leaving behind hundreds upon hundreds behind ....as time passed everything seemed normal again until 3 months ago….when suddenly another [DATA REDACTED] showed up right inside our new place hiding inside one our office room walls….that incident made me realize something had gone terribly wrong back then ....why would<br><br><h5>Addendum9004.2:</h5> Incident Report 9004-1<br><br><h5>= Level 4 Access Required - Close File Incident Report 9004-1:</h5> On █/██/20██, several members of MTF Theta-9 (Nine Tailed Fox) reported that they could hear sounds coming from behind a wall in one of the offices.

What were you trying to achieve by doing that ? SCP XXXX_1 : "Nothing Doctor ! It wasn't my idea!
