Personnel who have been exposed to <i>SCP-15433</i> are to be given Class A amnestics and returned to duty.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15433</i> is a nice and smelly bag of offal and viscera. <i>SCP-15433</i> has been observed to be <i>"nice"</i> in that it is pleasant to the senses, but also <i>"smelly"</i> in that it smells strongly of rotting meat. <i>SCP-15433</i> was discovered at the home of ██████████████, who reported finding it on his doorstep one morning. The Foundation traced the source of <i>SCP-15433</i> to an abandoned warehouse where several instances were found, along with evidence suggesting they had been produced by a group called <i>"The Smell Collective"</i>. No members of this group have been identified or located.<br><br>When a human being comes into contact with <i>SCP-15433</i> for more than 5 minutes, they will begin to feel very relaxed and happy. If they continue exposure for more than 10 minutes, they will begin to exhibit symptoms consistent with brain death (see Addendum 15433-3). If removed from contact after this point, subjects will become agitated and distressed until reexposed; if reexposed before symptoms develop fully (i.e., before brain death), these symptoms are reversed without lasting effects on mental health or cognition .<br><br><i>SCP-15433</i> was first contained when it caused an outbreak at Site ██; over 100 personnel were exposed before containment could be established . Since then, additional outbreaks have occurred at numerous Foundation sites as well as civilian locations such as shopping malls , schools , public parks , libraries , hospitals , airports , restaurants etc . The frequency and magnitude of these incidents have increased dramatically since initial containment efforts began; this increase has not yet been explained by any known factors relating either directly or indirectly to SCP- 154 33's properties .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15433.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████████<br><br>The following interview was conducted with ██████████████, the individual who originally reported <i>SCP-15433</i> to the Foundation.<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ███████: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████████. I would like to ask you a few questions about <i>SCP-15433</i>? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████████: </b>Sure thing, doc! Ask away! Dr . <br><br><b>███████: </b>To start off with, could you tell me how you came into possession of <i>SCP-15433</i>? Mr . <br><br><b>████████████: </b>Oh yeah! I found it on my doorstep one morning while I was getting ready for work; it was just sitting there in a baggie when I got home from work that night too! It's pretty weird how it got there though; no one saw anyone leave it or anything like that… Dr . <br><br><b>███████: </b>Did you notice anything unusual about the baggie itself? Anything out of place at all? Mr . <br><br><b>████████████: </b>Nah, not really…it looked just like any other baggie to me…except for maybe this symbol on the front here (indicates symbol). Do you know what that means doc? The doctor looks visibly uncomfortable at this point and hesitates before responding <i>"I'm not sure."</i> Dr . <br><br><b>███████: </b>And did your family or friends ever see this baggie before then ? Mr . <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Well sure they did ; we all used it as a trash can until we realized what happened when people touched it… Dr . <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Thank you very much for your time , sir. We will be in contact if we have any further questions regarding your experience with SCP- 154 33. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At this point in time , no connection between SCP- 154 33 and The Smell Collective has been established beyond their shared interest in producing art involving human bodily waste products (see Addendum 15433 - 3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15433.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15433-1: </b>D-15433 is placed in a room with <i>SCP-15433</i>. D-15433 is instructed to touch <i>SCP-15433</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-15433 reports that the object feels nice, but does not smell of anything. When asked to describe the object's odor, D- 154 33 states that it <i>"smells like nothing"</i>. This effect persists for 1 hour after exposure ends.<br><br>Experiment 15433 -2: D -1 54 33 is placed in a room with SCP -1 54 3 3 . The room is equipped with an air filtration system which can be used to remove odors from the air by filtering them through activated charcoal; this system has been previously calibrated to remove all odors except for those produced by SCP -1543 3 . After 5 minutes, the filtration system is activated and left on for 1 hour while subject remains exposed. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon activation of the filtration system , subject reports feeling relaxed and happy (rating scale shows a score of 8/10). However, when asked to describe his emotional state he states <i>"I feel kind of sad…like I've lost something."</i> Subject's emotional state returns to normal within 30 minutes after removal from exposure; postexposure analysis shows no long term effects on mental health or cognition .</div>
