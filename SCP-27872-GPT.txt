<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27872, referred to as "The Infinite Transit," is an anomalous stretch of highway located in [REDACTED], initially thought to be a segment of the unfinished expansion of Interstate [REDACTED]. SCP-27872 cannot be observed in its entirety; it extends infinitely when approached or traveled upon, curving in a manner that defies physical three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>Examining SCP-27872 with aerial surveillance equipment results in malfunction or inexplicable data loss, effectively preventing any form of remote measurement. Any individual or vehicle that progresses beyond a 500-meter threshold from the entry point appears to phase out of conventional reality, losing all radio contact. Upon return, they have reported inconsistencies in time perception, with subjective travel durations varying from several hours to several months. </p>
<p>SCP-27872's surface seems to exhibit properties of spatial-temporal distortion, allowing expedited travel between points in our known universe when specific criteria are met. This effect has elevated SCP-27872 to Thaumiel class due to its potential use in containment breach emergencies.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-27872 is surrounded by a 2km exclusion zone that must remain under vigilant surveillance. The official story for the area's closure is unremitting structural instability and hazardous conditions. Site-███ perimeter is fortified with barbed wire fences, armed security personnel, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) equipment to compromise digital recording devices.</p>
<p>Personnel assigned to SCP-27872 must undergo rigorous psychological screening and temporal anomaly training. Attempts to traverse the highway are strictly forbidden without prior approval from at least two Level 4 Senior Researchers.</p>
<p>Foundation-operated drones programmed with an automatic return sequence are deployed for experimentation purposes. These drones are fitted with specialized equipment to combat the electromagnetic and spatial-temporal anomalies experienced within SCP-27872.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log 27872-E</h3>
<h4>Experiment 27872-E1</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> An unmanned ground vehicle equipped with GPS tracking and a live video feed was deployed.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Contact lost after 500 meters. The vehicle returned 4 days later in an inexplicably aged state; GPS logged coordinates from several disparate locations across the globe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 27872-E2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> D-Class personnel instructed to traverse 1km and return.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Subject returned after 7 hours, though surveillance tracking indicated only 30 minutes had passed. Subject described visiting an urban area consistent with New York City, circa 1987. No temporal changes occurred in subject post-experiment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 27872-E3</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A remote drone with experimental temporal shielding.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Shielding partially effective. Drone transmitted incoherent data that, once decrypted, appeared to be the front page of a 1973 issue of the New York Times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Incident Report 27872-A</h3>
<p>On [DATE REDACTED], during a containment breach of SCP-████, all available personnel were utilized for emergency evacuation. The breach had catastrophic potential, necessitating rapid re-location of key staff and SCPs. By unanimous decision of the overseeing O5 Council members, SCP-27872 was utilized as an emergency conduit.</p>
<p>All evacuated personnel and SCPs were placed in retrofitted convoys with temporal shielding and driven onto SCP-27872. Where previously SCP-27872 extended infinitely, for the duration of the breach, destinations aligned precisely with several secure backup facilities across the world.</p>
<p>Upon resolving the breach, all personnel and SCPs were accounted for with no lasting temporal or spatial anomalies reported.</p>
<p>The success of this operation led to an expanded understanding of SCP-27872’s capabilities and its designation as Thaumiel. Continued research into its control mechanisms and potential applications is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Exploration Transcript 27872-B</h3>
<h4>Exploration 27872-B1</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team Composition:</strong> 4 agents equipped for extended temporal anomalies</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Reach an established probe launched 10km into SCP-27872, potentially indicative of an anchor point.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Team successfully retrieved the probe, encountering several temporally displaced environments along the journey. Most notably, they reported an area appearing to be ancient Egypt, where the agents were perceived as deities. Upon exiting, no venerations or temples erected in the name of the agents could be located in current historical records.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further exploration of SCP-27872 remains a high priority, given the immense implications on both containment processes and the underlying fabric of spacetime. The balance of utilizing SCP-27872's phenomenal capabilities with the inherent hazards of its unpredictable nature continues to be a pivotal subject of foundation-wide discourse.</p>
