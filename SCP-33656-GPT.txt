<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-33656, colloquially named "Quetzalcoatl" after the Mesoamerican deity due to its resemblance and historical connections, is an anomalous entity believed to be an incorporeal protector of global consciousness. Evidence of SCP-33656's existence is evident through various historical records that allude to a ‘serpent spirit’ that intervened during critical moments of human development and catastrophe.</p>
<p>SCP-33656 is capable of manifesting in multiple forms, most commonly appearing as a serpent with iridescent, feather-like scales. Witnesses have also described it as a blinding light or as a humanoid figure with serpentine qualities. Manifestations are often preceded by a low-frequency hum, noticeable temperature shifts, and a localized bending of light.</p>
<p>Although SCP-33656's intentions seem benevolent and geared towards stabilization of the human psyche and global communities, its vast powers and unpredictable interventions necessitate careful monitoring. 33656 has authority and willingness to alter reality to safeguard the intellectual evolution of humanity, suggesting the potential for catastrophic side effects if not properly understood and contained.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Direct containment of SCP-33656 is currently impossible due to its non-corporeal and mobile nature. Instead, containment efforts are focused on monitoring and response.</p>
<p>A network of surveillance systems (codenamed "Ancestral Eye") is implemented across various historical, cultural, and spiritual sites linked to SCP-33656 activity. Research personnel are advised to disguise the equipment to blend seamlessly with the environment.</p>
<p>Embedded agents within academic and religious circles are to report any SCP-33656-related phenomenon for immediate analysis and potential intervention.</p>
<p>In the event of a manifestation, a designated Mobile Task Force (MTF Xi-4 "Myth Breakers") with specialized knowledge of religious and cross-cultural diplomacy is to be dispatched. They are to perform disinformation campaigns or witness pacification as necessary.</p>
<p>Should SCP-33656's actions risk public exposure or significantly alter the status quo, use of Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) is authorized to stabilize the region's baseline reality until SCP-33656 de-manifests.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Historical References</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1: Mayan Civilization</strong>: Records describe a ‘vision serpent’ that guided rulers by dispensing knowledge and warnings during critical decisions. SCP-33656 is believed to have influenced the trajectory of the civilization, though further evidence is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.2: World War II</strong>: A classified report by an Allied soldier mentioned a 'luminous serpentine figure' in the sky over a battlefield which inexplicably ceased combat on both sides for a brief period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Incident Log 33656-A</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2.1: 1987 Mexico City Earthquake</strong>: Multiple independent sources reported seeing a large, feathered serpent in the sky moments before the early warning system activated, giving residents additional time to evacuate. Surveillance confirmed the manifestation of SCP-33656.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.2: The Great Calm of 2005</strong>: An inexplicable event occurring in a politically unstable country where all hostile actions between clashing factions ceased for 24 hours. Satellite imagery detected a temporary spatial distortion consistent with SCP-33656's presence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 33656-E1</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To communicate with SCP-33656 using a combination of ritualistic practices from Mesoamerican cultures known to have had contact with the entity.
<strong>Outcome</strong>: Partial success. SCP-33656 manifested briefly and communicated in an ancient dialect of Nahuatl. The entity alluded to a coming crisis that humanity would not be able to face alone.</p>
<h4>Experiment 33656-E2</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Use of a Scranton Reality Anchor to temporarily restrict SCP-33656's abilities during its manifestation and study its reaction.
<strong>Outcome</strong>: SCP-33656 appeared to be unaffected by the SRA, though it did address researchers, indicating awareness of the attempt at confinement and mentioning the importance of balance and freedom for its purpose.</p>
<h4>Experiment 33656-E3</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Engage SCP-33656 in a controlled environment with D-class personnel exhibiting aggressive behavior to observe any alterations in their actions.
<strong>Outcome</strong>: D-class personnel halted all violent actions in the presence of SCP-33656, later reporting an overwhelming sense of peace and clarity. Effects lasted 72 hours post-exposure.</p>
<p>As SCP-33656 remains an unpredictable, yet seemingly benign force, the current stance of the SCP Foundation is to respect and cautiously aid in its purpose, while maintaining a vigilant stance against any potential threat it may inadvertently pose.</p>
