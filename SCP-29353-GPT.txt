<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-29353 is a colossal macro-organism that resides in the Earth's deepest ocean trenches, primarily in the Mariana Trench. It is largely amorphous, with a constantly changing number of appendages and a central mass the true size of which remains undetermined due to its tendency to blend with its surroundings. SCP-29353's most defining feature is its elongated "tail," a tentacle-like structure that stretches for an estimated 40,000 kilometers, wrapping multiple times around the Earth's crust beneath the ocean floor.</p>
<p>SCP-29353 exhibits a range of anomalous effects, including localized spacetime distortions, extreme gravitational anomalies, and the ability to induce existential dread in humans who directly observe it or perceive it through remote equipment. The appendages of SCP-29353 display predatory behavior, often resulting in the disappearance of marine life and, in some instances, larger vessels or submarines.</p>
<p>Foundation researchers have hypothesized that SCP-29353 has existed since the Pre-Cambrian era, potentially influencing Earth's geological and biological development. Its connection to a series of historical extinction-level events is under investigation.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Complete physical containment of SCP-29353 is currently impossible due to its size and the anomalous properties associated with its presence. The Foundation has established a perimeter around the Mariana Trench, designated as Area-533, enforcing a no-entry zone for unauthorized civilian or military traffic. Enhanced sonar and deep-water monitoring networks have been deployed to track SCP-29353's movements and activity levels.</p>
<p>Conventional weapons have proven ineffective against SCP-29353; hence, containment efforts are focused on monitoring and mitigating its impacts. Research into potential countermeasures or means of communication is ongoing.</p>
<p>Foundation PsyOps and the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) have launched concerted disinformation campaigns to dismiss any information leakage as pseudoscientific theories or hoaxes, aiming to prevent mass panic.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Log</h3>
<p>SCP-29353 was initially discovered in 19██ following a series of unexplained tidal phenomena and mysterious disappearances of deep-sea expeditions. Foundation deep-submergence vehicle "DSV-Abyssal Observer" conducted preliminary reconnaissance and encountered SCP-29353's tail, leading to the establishment of the current containment procedures.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Test Alpha:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with an extended-range high-resolution camera was deployed to capture visual data of SCP-29353.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-29353's appendages destroyed the ROV. Secondary effects included temporary loss of satellite communication and widespread electronic malfunctions within a 500 km radius.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Test Beta:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A D-Class personnel in a deep-diving suit equipped with live-feed video and audio comm was sent within proximity of SCP-29353.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> D-Class experienced extreme psychological breakdown prior to video feed loss; recovery mission was deemed non-viable. Audio captured described SCP-29353 as "the weaver of the dark tapestry that cloaks the bed of the world."</li>
</ul>
<h4>Test Gamma:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> An attempt was made to sever a small appendage of SCP-29353 using a modified submersible with a high-intensity laser.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> A violent reaction from SCP-29353 caused a localized tsunami, resulting in ██ casualties and considerable damage to Area-533. The severed appendage regenerated within 3 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Log</h3>
<h4>Incident 29353-A:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong> A predicted pattern shift in SCP-29353's tail led to an alteration in Earth's axial tilt, causing minor global climatic anomalies. The Foundation's intervention under the guise of a clandestine geoengineering project prevented widespread detection and hysteria.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Incident 29353-B:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong> A previously undiscovered appendage breached the ocean's surface near ████████, emitting a soundwave at a frequency interpreted as distress. Local populations exhibited increased aggression and self-destructive tendencies until the appendage submerged.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing Notes:</h3>
<p>SCP-29353 remains a significant threat to global stability, with the potential to initiate XK (End-of-the-World), YK (End-of-Reality), and ZK (End-of-Reality-as-We-Conceive-It) scenarios. Its existence testifies to the vast, unexplored mysteries our world harbors and the continuously evolving understanding that the SCP Foundation must maintain to ensure the security, containment, and protection of humanity.</p>
<p>Further research and contingency plans are critical, as SCP-29353's patterns and behavior are not yet fully understood, and its potential for causing unparalleled catastrophe is ever-present. Ongoing vigilance and cutting-edge scientific advancements are required to match the complexity and scale of SCP-29353. The Abyssal Tapestry weaves an ominous shadow beneath our seas, where depths unknown ripple with unfathomable power.</p>
