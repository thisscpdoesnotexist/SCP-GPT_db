<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-20473 is  "come watch me decompose"</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20473<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20473</i> is a humanoid entity of indeterminate age and gender, standing approximately 2 meters in height. <i>SCP-20473</i>'s body is composed entirely of plant matter, including leaves, stems, and roots. The entity appears to be in a state of constant decomposition; its features are constantly shifting and decaying as it moves.<br><br>When spoken to or interacted with directly, <i>SCP-20473</i> will respond with cryptic phrases such as <i>"come watch me decompose"</i> or <i>"I am the cycle of life"</i>. Attempts at communication have been largely unsuccessful due to the rapid decay of its form.<br><br><i>SCP-20473</i> does not appear to require sustenance for survival; however, when exposed to direct sunlight it will rapidly increase in size and strength before reverting back to its original size after several minutes. During this time period it has displayed an increased level of aggression towards any living creature within range.<br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-20473</i>'s behavior and its ability to rapidly regenerate itself from even minimal amounts of plant material it is considered a Keter class object requiring special containment procedures at all times.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20473</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with walls made of reinforced concrete. The chamber must be kept in complete darkness at all times and monitored by security cameras.<br><br>Personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear, including full body armor and face masks, to protect against any potential contact with <i>SCP-20473</i>. Personnel are not allowed to interact directly with <i>SCP-20473</i> under any circumstances.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-20473</i> begins to grow rapidly or display signs of aggression, personnel are authorized to use nonlethal force if necessary in order to contain it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20473.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-20473</i> was observed to enter a dormant state for an extended period of time. During this time, it ceased all movement and its body appeared to be in a state of suspended animation. After approximately three weeks, it returned to its normal activity level with no apparent changes in behavior or physiology.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20473.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-20473</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, personnel attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-20473</i> in an attempt to gain further insight into its behavior. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt <br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, can you understand me? <br><b><i>SCP-20473</i>:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell us why you are here? <br><b><i>SCP-20473</i>:</b> I am here because I must be. It is my purpose in life to decompose and become one with the earth again. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> What do you mean by that? <br><b><i>SCP-20473</i>:</b> I am part of the cycle of life. I am here to help break down and recycle the materials that make up our world. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any other purpose? <br><b><i>SCP-20473</i>:</b> Come watch me decompose, and you will see my true purpose.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 20473.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 20473.3-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a single living organism (a rabbit) was placed in the containment chamber with <i>SCP-20473</i>. The entity immediately began to grow rapidly and display signs of aggression towards the animal, which it proceeded to consume within minutes. After consuming the rabbit, <i>SCP-20473</i> returned to its original size and resumed its previous behavior.</div>
