Any subjects who have viewed <i>SCP-16910</i> for more than 10 minutes are to be taken into custody and questioned about their experience with the anomaly. If they report seeing the figure described above, they are to undergo a psychiatric evaluation before being administered Class A amnestics and released.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16910</i> is a TV channel that manifests anomalous properties at night or the evening, mostly between 6PM and 5AM. <i>SCP-16910</i>'s broadcast area is currently limited to the city of ██████████, Portugal.<br><br><i>SCP-16910</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when a subject views it for more than 10 minutes. The subject will then begin to feel tired and will fall asleep after 20 minutes if no other action is taken. If the subject sleeps for 2 hours, they will wake up with their eyes closed and their eyelids sewn shut with sewing thread. The thread can be removed by any person without causing harm to the subject or themselves, but this process takes about 1 minute per stitch. After removing all stitches from both eyelids, subjects report seeing an image of a humanoid figure in white robes standing behind them while they were sleeping.. Subjects describe this figure as being tall (around 2 meters) with long black hair covering its face and having its arms raised above its head in such a way that it appears to be praying; however no other details are visible due to the darkness surrounding it in all reported cases so far . This figure does not seem hostile towards subjects who have woken up from <i>SCP-16910</i>'s effect as of yet .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16910.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████████, a male subject who viewed <i>SCP-16910</i> for 10 minutes. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Doctor ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after the subject woke up from <i>SCP-16910</i>'s effect. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Doctor <br><br><b>████: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████. How are you feeling? Subject appears to be in good health and shows no signs of discomfort or distress. Subject is visibly shaken by the experience he just had and seems to be trying to suppress his emotions as much as possible . Subject begins crying . Doctor <br><br><b>████: </b>It's alright, Mr. ██████, we can talk about it later if you want; but right now I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened when you were watching that TV channel earlier today… [Subject wipes his tears away with his hand] <br><br><b>Subject: </b>[in an unstable voice] Okay… I'll try… What do you want me to say? That I saw something that shouldn't exist? That it looked at me while I was sleeping and made my eyelids sew themselves shut ? Is that what you want me to say? <br><br><b>Doctor: </b>No, please calm down; we already know what happened so there is no need for us to guess , we just want your opinion on this matter . How did this figure make you feel ? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Scared , confused , tired … The figure appeared behind my back while I was asleep and looked at me with its eyes closed all the time … It didn't move or talk or anything like that but it still scared the hell out of me … And then there were those noises too ; they sounded like people praying but they weren't really people because they didn't have any voices . They just kept on going <i>"Oh God oh God oh God"</i> over and over again until it felt like my head would explode from all those voices saying <i>"oh god"</i> in chorus . Then suddenly everything went silent except for one voice which said <i>"wake up"</i> before everything disappeared along with the figure behind my back . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being administered Class A amnestics, Mr Doctor stated he had no recollection of what he had previously told us during our interview. He also stated that he did not remember ever hearing any noise coming from <i>SCP-16910</i> during its broadcast period nor having seen any kind of figure in white robes standing behind him while sleeping; however further investigation revealed several inconsistencies between his statements regarding both subjects (see Addendum 16910-3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16910.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-1722, a 32 year old female.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to view <i>SCP-16910</i> for 10 minutes. After the time had elapsed, she was asked to sleep for 2 hours and then wake up. Once awake, she was asked about her experience with the anomaly and told to describe what she saw in as much detail as possible .<br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject described seeing a humanoid figure standing behind her while sleeping; however it did not match the description of the figure given by other subjects who have viewed <i>SCP-16910</i> so far . She described it as being <i>"taller than most people"</i> and having long white hair that covered its face; however when questioned about its appearance in more detail, she said that it <i>"wasn't clear"</i>. When asked if there were any other features that stood out from her experience with <i>SCP-16910</i>, she said that while sleeping <i>"she felt like [the figure] was watching over [her]"</i>.<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-1723, a 35 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as Experiment 16910.3 except this time he is instructed to try and remove one of his own stitches before waking up from his nap . He is also equipped with an audio recorder which will be activated once he wakes up after 2 hours of sleep so he can record himself removing the stitch while describing what he sees at all times . Once done recording , subject is again asked to describe his experience with <i>SCP-16910</i> in great detail .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After removing one stitch from his left eyelid , subject immediately woke up screaming loudly and began running around the room erratically before attempting to jump out of the window located at Site ██'s testing chamber's second floor; however due to testing chamber's reinforced glass windows , this attempt failed causing him minor injuries which were treated quickly by on site medical staff. Subject then began babbling incoherently until sedated by medical staff using Class B amnestics without further incident. Audio recording revealed no anomalous activity during or after removal of stitch ; however when played back later during analysis revealed several instances where voice distortion could be heard along with heavy breathing sounds at various points throughout audio recording (See Addendum 16910.4).<br><br></div>
