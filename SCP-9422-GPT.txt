Do you understand me? Are there any means of communication we could use to talk with each other? Anything like that? Please answer yes or no using sign language for yes and shaking your head for no if possible.<i>"<br><br>At this point, <i>SCP-9422</i> starts moving around the table it was placed on while making some kind of strange noises and gestures that seemed to be attempts at communicating through sign language despite lacking proper hands to do so properly . The movements it made were completely random and impossible to understand by human standards while also having nothing in common with those used by actual people who can also make such noises due to having suffered either hand loss or paralysis from birth . It continued doing so until the end of the interview when it started knocking over equipment on the table as well as throwing around various different objects inside its containment cell until they stopped trying to communicate with it again out of fear for their safety . <End Log><br> Closing Statement: Attempts at using speech recognition software have been unsuccessful thus far due , most likely , directly to an insufficiency in available data given how unintelligible all attempts at communication have been so far . See Addendum 9423 for details about an attempted exchange between another individual affected by similar symptoms resulting in even more incoherent responses than usual along with a conclusion regarding these vocalizations' nature which seems rather unlikely given current evidence but which might prove useful nevertheless due , once again , directly and solely due precisely entirely only specifically exclusively completely 100% completely exclusively 100% completely exclusively (and only)<br> exactly specifically especifically uniquely exactly : See Addendum 9423 below . +<br> Addendum 9423 - Hide Addendum 9423 O5 Council Memo █████████ Re : Possible information retrieval from Object # : SCP - 9 4 22 Submitted By : Dr ████ On Date : 11 / 08 /<br> 200█ Subject : Reevaluation of acquisition data relevant concerning Object # :SCP - 9 4 22 Summary & Analysis In light of recent events related concerning said object's recovery process I hereby request that I be granted access top classified material recovered during [DATA REDACTED] after submitting my credentials without delay from your end please because I am starting too long ago already waiting long enough already including but not limited too yet still need much more time effort as well as resources than initially expected thanks !
