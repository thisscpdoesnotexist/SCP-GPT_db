<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-25583 is  according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-25583<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-25583</i> is a species of bee that appears to be an anomalous variant of Apis mellifera. It possesses the same general morphology as a normal honey bee, however its wings are significantly smaller than those of its non-anomalous counterparts. Despite this, it is capable of sustained flight for indefinite periods of time and with speeds far exceeding that which would be expected from such small wings.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-25583</i> is unknown, though there have been several sightings in various parts of the world over the past few decades. All known specimens appear to share the same genetic makeup and display similar behavior patterns; they are highly social insects that form large colonies and feed primarily on nectar and pollen from flowers.<br><br>Attempts to study or capture specimens have thus far been unsuccessful due to their extreme agility in flight and their tendency to flee when approached by humans or other animals.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the difficulty of locating and containing <i>SCP-25583</i>, no specific containment procedures have been established. Any sightings of <i>SCP-25583</i> should be reported to the nearest Foundation facility for further investigation.<br><br>In the event that a specimen is successfully captured, it should be contained in a standard insectarium and monitored closely for any unusual behavior or changes in its physical characteristics.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25583.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a specimen of <i>SCP-25583</i> was successfully captured by Foundation personnel in [REDACTED], France. Upon examination, it was found to possess several unique physical traits not seen on other specimens, including a pair of antennae that seemed to be capable of emitting low-frequency electromagnetic pulses.<br><br>Further testing is currently underway to determine the purpose and potential applications of this phenomenon.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25583.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><br>On ██/██/20██, Dr. ██████ was interviewed regarding <i>SCP-25583</i>'s anomalous behavior and possible origins. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> <i>"I've been studying this species for some time now, and I can tell you that it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. Its wings are too small to generate enough lift for sustained flight, yet somehow it manages to remain airborne indefinitely."</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Do you think there could be a scientific explanation for this?"</i> <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> <i>"It's possible that the bees have developed a form of aerodynamic adaptation that allows them to fly despite their small wings. It's also possible that they have some form of unknown energy source that provides them with the power to remain airborne."</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Have you been able to identify any other unusual characteristics of the species?"</i> <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> <i>"Yes, there are a few. For one, they seem to be attracted to certain types of light sources, such as street lamps and car headlights. They also appear to have an unusually long lifespan compared to other bee species."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 25583.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><br>On ██/██/████, a specimen of <i>SCP-25583</i> was successfully captured and contained in a standard insectarium. The following experiments were conducted to determine the limits of its anomalous capabilities.<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> Flight Speed Test: A course consisting of several obstacles was set up within the insectarium and the specimen was released. It managed to navigate through all obstacles with ease, reaching speeds far exceeding those expected from such small wings. Further tests revealed that it could reach speeds up to ███ km/h while in flight.</div>
