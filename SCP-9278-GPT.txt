It has a black body, with a white mask on its face. It also has fluffy hairs on its back that it uses to catch mosquito's and flies within reach.<br><br><i>SCP-9278</i> was discovered by Dr. ████ while he was walking around the rain forests of ████████, ██████████, accompanied by his team of researchers. The discovery was made when one researcher saw <i>SCP-9278</i> killing mosquitoes (pictured above). The specimen will then eat the dead mosquito it killed with gusto while waving at the researcher holding its cage.[DATA EXPUNGED] This led to 9278's current classification as safe and nonhazardous to personnel.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9278</i> was discovered at ████████, ██████████ on ███████, 19██.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9278.1 :</h3> The following is a transcript of the video taken by Dr. ████ during the discovery of <i>SCP-9278</i><br><br><Begin Log> Dr.<br> ████: Hey, can you get that cage closer to the mosquitoes?<br> Researcher ██████: Yeah sure. *Researcher ██████ moves the cage closer to a group of about 20 mosquitoes* Dr.<br> ████: Can you see this? It looks like it's dancing!<br> Researcher ██████: I can see it, but what is it doing? Dr.<br> ████: Well, if I'm not wrong…it's killing them!<br> Researcher ██████: How come they didn't notice 9278 before we got here? And how come nobody noticed us as we came in too? They don't seem to be afraid of us at all… Dr.<br> W████████: Maybe they're hypnotized or something! Let me try and wave back at one! *Dr W████████ waves at a mosquito* (At this point, all mosquitoes near them start attacking him) Dr W████████(screaming): AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!! Quickly put me down….quickly… (Dr W████████ was placed on the floor by his fellow researchers and later discovered that he was dead from loss of blood) <End Log><br><br><h3>Addendum 9278.2 :</h3> The following is a conversation between Dr. ████ and 9278<br><br><Begin Log> Dr.<br> ████: Hello 9278, my name is Dr.███████████ and I'm going to be your handler from now on! Your previous handler was killed by the mosquitoes he attracted around him. I really hope that won't happen to me…<br> <i>SCP-9278</i>: Hiiiii…my human master…thank you for saving me from those evil mosquitoes! My name is <i>SCP-9278</i> and I will catch as many of them as you want so they don't kill you too! Dr.<br> ████: Oh, thank you! So can I ask what do you eat? You seem like a spider who loves birds but also mosquito's..<br> <i>SCP-9278</i>: Am not a bird eater, stupid human master….I like eating flies most of all but those nasty mosquito's are what made me famous among the other spiders in my home town!! They used to play pranks on humans by entering their homes through doors or windows with just one thought in mind; killing humans with deadly bites!! But then I came along and now they realize that this thought was wrong when they see me taking care of them every day before dinner time (laughs) Dr. ████(laughs): That's great news for us humans indeed but why did those mosquitoes attack us earlier? Why didn't they flee away once we entered their territory? They are usually known for being aggressive around</div>
