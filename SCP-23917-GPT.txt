I had been feeling down and overwhelmed for a while, and nothing seemed to help. One night, I decided to sit down at the piano and just play whatever came to mind. It wasn't until after I finished that I realized what it was; it had come out of me almost instinctively. When my friends heard it, they said it made them feel so much better - like all their worries were melting away - so we started calling it <i>"Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2"</i>.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you think there's something special about this piece?<br><b><br>Aya Higuchi:</b> I can't say for sure, but it does seem to have a calming effect on people.
