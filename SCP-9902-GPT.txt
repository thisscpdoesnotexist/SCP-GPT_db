<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9902</i> is Refrigerator magnets</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9902</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9902</i> is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site-██. No personnel are allowed to touch <i>SCP-9902</i> under any circumstances.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9902</i> is a set of fridge magnets, each one depicting a different animal. Each magnet has the words <i>"I'm not your pet"</i> written on it in black marker.<br><br><i>SCP-9902</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when any human being attempts to touch <i>SCP-9902</i>. Upon doing so, the subject will immediately begin acting like that animal. The subject will be unable to speak and will try to hunt for food in the same way as that animal would (e.g., if they touched a magnet depicting a snake, they would attempt to hunt by slithering on the ground). Subjects affected by <i>SCP-9902</i> are also unable to wear clothing or use tools made of metal or wood (excluding wooden spoons), and their bodies gradually change over time until they resemble their respective animal species more closely (see Addendum 9902/1). If an affected individual dies while under its effects, another human being who touches <i>SCP-9902</i> afterwards will become affected by it instead.<br><br><i>SCP-9902</i> was discovered after several children at [REDACTED] Elementary School were found acting strangely during recess on ██/██/████ . Classmates reported that some children had begun crawling around on all fours and hissing like snakes, while others had started eating only meat and hunting for prey with sticks and rocks near bushes outside the school building . Foundation agents embedded at [REDACTED] Elementary School investigated this incident shortly thereafter; however, no abnormal activity was found except for several broken windows leading outside from one of the classrooms . On ██/██/████ , Agent ██████ attempted to apprehend one of these students who had climbed out through one of these windows but was bitten by him before he could do so . Agent ██████'s body began changing into what appeared to be an adult male lion shortly thereafter; however, he managed to escape before further changes could occur due to his training as a Foundation agent . A search party led by Agent ████ discovered <i>SCP-9902</i> inside said classroom later that day , along with several other objects which were suspected of having caused this incident but were later proven not anomalous after thorough investigation (see Addendum 9902/2). After testing proved inconclusive regarding how exactly <i>SCP-9904</i> causes its effects , it was classified as Safe until further notice .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9902.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████, mother of one of the affected students.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Mrs. █████ was asked to describe what happened during the incident at [REDACTED] Elementary School on ██/██/████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Please describe what happened during recess on the day in question. Mrs. <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well, it was just like any other day… I dropped my son off at school and went to work as usual . When I got home from work that evening, my husband told me that our son had been acting weird all day . He said he'd seen him crawling around on all fours and eating raw meat out of the garbage can outside their classroom . Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Did you see your son acting like this yourself? Mrs. █████ nods affirmatively . Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>What did you do after that? Mrs. <br><br><b>█████: </b>We took him to a doctor… but he couldn't tell us what was wrong with him either… After a few days , his condition didn't seem to get any worse so we decided not to take him back there anymore… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After investigation , it was found that <i>SCP-9902</i> had been placed in front of a broken window leading outside from one of classrooms at [REDACTED] Elementary School prior to the incident occurring; however, no further evidence could be found regarding who or why someone would have done this or how they managed to place <i>SCP-9902</i> there without being seen by anyone else . The parents of several other children who were affected by <i>SCP-9902</i> have also been interviewed; however, none have reported seeing anything suspicious before their child came home from school later than usual one afternoon (see Addendum 9902/3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9902.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Note: </b>All experiments must be authorized by at least one (1) Level 3 personnel.<br><br>Experiment #: 1 Subject(s): D-9902-1, a male adult human being weighing approximately 80 kilograms. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9902-1 was instructed to touch <i>SCP-9902</i> with his right index finger while wearing a pair of gloves made of rubber. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon touching <i>SCP-9902</i>, D-9902-1 began acting like a domesticated dog . He attempted to bark and lick the hands of Dr. ████████, who was supervising the experiment, but could not speak due to the presence of the rubber gloves on his hands . After several minutes had passed, D-9902 began attempting to remove the glove from his right hand using only his mouth; however , he failed in doing so because it would no longer fit in his mouth after several attempts . After removing them completely with both hands , he resumed trying to bark and lick Dr. ████████'s hand for approximately ten minutes before becoming docile again . <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It is likely that <i>SCP-990</i> -2's transformation would have continued if it had not removed its rubber glove before doing so; however , this is unconfirmed as further testing has been deemed unnecessary at this time due to its low priority status. Experiment #: 2 Subject(s): A female adult human being weighing approximately 80 kilograms (hereby referred as <i>"D - 99 02 - 2 "</i>) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The same procedure as Experiment # 1 was followed ; however , instead of wearing rubber gloves , D - 99 02 - 2 wore thick leather gauntlets made specifically for her by Foundation personnel during testing . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon touching SCP 99 02 , D - 9 9 0 2 ' s body began transforming into what appeared to be an adult lioness ; however she remained conscious throughout most of her transformation process unlike subject [REDACTED] from Experiment # 1 . She also did not attempt any form of self harm like subject [REDACTED] did during said experiment ; instead she used her left hand (which still retained some degree o f mobility despite significant changes having occurred on it) t o remove th e leat her ga ug ets fr om h er ri ght ha nd w hich b y th en wo rk ed su ccessfully without any resistance whatsoever (the fingers on said hand had already been replaced with claws). She then proceeded t o use both hands t o tear apart th e leat her ga ug et s an d thr ow them aside afterwards before attempting t o speak but failing due ot h er vocal cords now being similar in structure t o those found in lions and other large felines which are incapable ot producing speech sounds that humans are able ot understand <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It appears that subjects affected by SCP 9992 do n ot lose consciousness durin g their tran sfor mation process unlike those affected b y Scp 9993 or Scp 9994 which suggests that they may retain consciou sness throughout most or all parts of their tran sformation process depending on how close they are towards resembling their respective animal species when they were first exposed towards SCP 9992's effects<br><br></div>
