The entity is to be given access to a variety of writing materials and sign language boards; however, it must not be allowed any physical contact with human beings or humanoids.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14483</i> is a humanoid entity measuring 2.1 meters in height, with an elongated skull and a large jaw. <i>SCP-14483</i>'s skin is covered in a layer of fine hair, and its eyes are black with no visible pupils. The entity wears what appears to be an ornate suit of samurai armor, consisting of chainmail and plates made from unknown materials.<br><br><i>SCP-14483</i>'s primary anomalous property manifests when it comes within 50 meters of any object or person; all matter within this radius will begin to experience rapid decay, causing the affected material to become brittle and break apart after approximately 15 seconds. <i>SCP-14483</i> does not appear to be aware that it causes this effect on objects around it; however, the entity will actively seek out humans or humanoids for interaction purposes (see Addendum 14483-1).<br><br>When <i>SCP-14483</i> makes physical contact with a human being or humanoid creature , the subject will immediately undergo radical physical changes as follows:<br><br>The subject's internal organs will begin to rapidly decay until they are completely liquefied; the subject's skin will then rupture due to pressure buildup inside their body cavity . The liquefied organs are then expelled from every orifice on their body at high speed (see Addendum 14483-2). After approximately 30 seconds following this event, all traces of biological material left behind by the subject disappear completely . All DNA samples taken from subjects affected by <i>SCP-14493</i> show signs consistent with extreme radiation exposure . Subjects who have undergone these changes have been designated <i>SCP-14493</i> instances . Instances do not appear physically altered beyond minor discoloration caused by radiation exposure ; however, instances possess no vital signs when examined using medical equipment capable of detecting such signs (see Addendum 14493 - 3 ). Instances do not require sustenance , nor do they exhibit any form of metabolism beyond that required for basic cellular function . When provided foodstuffs , instances instead attempt to consume nearby organic matter , including other organisms ; however , if there is insufficient organic matter available for consumption within an instance 's proximity , they instead attempt self - termination via various methods such as suffocation or immolation ( see Incident Log 14 483 - 1 ) Instances possess no detectable form of sentience outside that which is necessary for survival instinct s; however , when questioned about their current state via nonverbal means such as writing boards or sign language boards they respond coherently using phrases similar in nature to those<br><br><h3>Addendum 14483.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████████, a D-Class personnel who was exposed to <i>SCP-14483</i>'s effect<br><br>+ Interview Log 14483 - 1 - Close log <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-1234, a 45 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after D-1234 had been exposed to <i>SCP-14483</i>'s effect for approximately 4 minutes . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>What is your name?<br><br>D - <br><br><b>1234: </b>My name… my name is… (Subject pauses for several seconds.) …my name is… (Subject pauses again.) …my name is….
