The door had been barricaded with several cracked test tubes, broken glassware, and various other lab equipment. On the wall were several writings and drawings done in what appears to be dried blood. All tests were suspended until Dr. ██████ returned from a medical leave of absence due to a mental breakdown caused by <i>SCP-</i>XXXX.<br><br>+<br> Addendum 9510 - Close Addendum 9510: Recovery Interview Log (1)<br> Interviewed: Dr [REDACTED]<br> Interviewer: Dr [REDACTED]<br> Foreword: This interview was recorded after security discovered <i>SCP-</i>XXXX in containment room 2a. <Begin Log> Dr [REDACTED]: Please state your name for the record? D-[REDACTED]: D-[REDACTED], I'm one of site 19's new researchers assigned to <i>SCP-</i>███ research as of three weeks ago, ask away but make it quick my shift is almost over soon and I don't want to be here any longer then necessary…<br><br>Dr [REDACTED]: Alright we'll make this brief then, tell me what happened?<br><br>D-[REDACTED]: Well it all started when I came into work today around 0430 hours as usual…I unlocked the door with my ID card like normal but when I went inside everything was off and quiet…<br><br>Dr[Redacted]: Please elaborate further<br><br>D[Redacted.] : Well usually there are always sounds coming from 2a whether its other researchers working or some kind of animal but this time there was nothing so I decided to investigate why everything seemed so quiet….and that's when things began getting strange…as soon as i entered into room 2A i noticed a slight breeze coming from out of nowhere which felt oddly cold for some odd reason then that's when i saw them….they looked like rats at first since they were about the same size except for their tails which looked more like snakes or worms than actual rats tails..anyways they swarmed me immediately going through my pockets stealing all my personal belongings including my wallet containing both credit cards and cash along with taking anything else valuable such as flash drives containing important data on them…that's not even half of it either..I could see these little creatures running off with pieces if paper containing notes written on them containing formulas used specifically for testing purposes only known by myself within our research group along with the rest of site 19 personnel who have access to our specific testing chambers….but that still wasn't even close to being over yet…..then suddenly i hear a loud bang come from behind me followed immediately afterwards by an abnormally large gust if wind hitting me square in face knocking me down hard onto floor while also causing all papers they stole off me blow away while also causing any remaining light sources within 2A shut down instantly followed shortly after by every single door within our lab slamming shut……at this point im just lying there wondering what just happened when<br><br><h3>Addendum 9510.2 :</h3> Incident log<br><br>+<br> Incident Log 9510-1 - Close Incident Log 9510-1: On ██/██/████ at 0430 hours, the power within Site 19 went out due to an unknown cause resulting in the containment breach of several SCPs including <i>SCP-</i>████, <i>SCP-</i>███ and <i>SCP-</i>████. Due to this incident, Dr. [REDACTED] fled from his office located on site 19's first floor and barricaded himself inside room 2a which was testing chamber for both D-[REDACTED]'s research and other projects assigned to him by his superiors. <Begin Log> [DATA EXPUNGED]…it then held its hands out towards me as if it were expecting something….I had no idea what it wanted so i just stared back at it while also trying not to move or make any sudden movements since I could clearly see that these things weren't actually alive but instead just some kind of shadow….but a couple minutes later they started screaming at me demanding whatever they wanted while also shaking their heads angrily…..at this point im becoming more than a little bit frightened knowing these things have the ability to take solid form yet still can't understand anything we say or do…that's when i notice one moving over towards my side table along with another one going under my desk looking for whatever else it could find……then all of a sudden I hear them scream as loud as they can before suddenly disappearing into thin air with everything else in 2A following shortly afterwards</div>
