Upon consumption of <i>SCP-16998</i>, the subject will immediately gain an encyclopedic knowledge of all topics and subjects relating to the universe. This knowledge appears to be permanent and can not be removed or forgotten by any known means.<br><br>The effects of consuming <i>SCP-16998</i> are not limited to just knowledge; the subject will also gain access to a seemingly infinite amount of energy, allowing them to perform superhuman feats such as flight, telekinesis, teleportation and other abilities that have yet to be fully explored or understood.

The subject was given access to <i>SCP-16998</i> and instructed to consume it. <br><br>Immediately following consumption, the subject began exhibiting signs of extreme intelligence and knowledge beyond what would be expected from any human being. The subject then proceeded to demonstrate several superhuman abilities such as flight, telekinesis and teleportation. <br><br>The research team quickly realized that the powers granted by <i>SCP-16998</i> were too dangerous for any individual person or group to possess and terminated the experiment immediately. All personnel involved in this incident have been debriefed and reassigned elsewhere within the Foundation.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16998.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-16998-1, the test subject from Addendum 16998.1<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 16998.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/<br><br><b>20██: </b>Test subject D-16998 was given access to <i>SCP-16998</i> and instructed to consume it.<br><br><b>Result: </b>Upon consumption, the test subject immediately began exhibiting signs of extreme intelligence and knowledge beyond what would be expected from any human being.
