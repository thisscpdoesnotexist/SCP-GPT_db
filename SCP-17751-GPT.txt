<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17751 is  a worm in your brain that tells you things, like "you don't have the body type to pull off denim" or "the documents you've been forging have led to countless deaths."</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17751<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17751</i> is a parasitoid organism that primarily infects the human brain. It takes the form of an eel-like creature, approximately 15 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. Its skin is covered with small spines and its head bears two eyes which appear to be capable of limited vision.<br><br>Once <i>SCP-17751</i> has infected a human host, it begins to secrete chemicals into the host's brain that alter their behavior, thought processes, and emotions. These changes are often subtle at first but can become more pronounced over time as <i>SCP-17751</i> gains control over its host's mind. The most common effects include increased paranoia, depression, suicidal ideation, violent outbursts of anger or despair, and delusions or hallucinations related to guilt or impending doom.<br><br>In addition to these psychological effects on its hosts, <i>SCP-17751</i> also produces vocalizations similar to those of a person speaking in a low voice directly into the ear of its victim; these vocalizations typically contain warnings such as <i>"You will never find peace,"</i> <i>"Your actions have consequences,"</i> or <i>"The truth will set you free."</i> It is unknown whether this phenomenon is caused by telepathy or some other means of communication between <i>SCP-17751</i> and its hosts.<br><br><i>SCP-17751</i> appears to be highly contagious; contact with even small amounts of contaminated fluid (such as saliva) can result in infection within minutes if not treated immediately with appropriate antibiotics. Infected individuals must be quarantined until they have been successfully treated for the parasite; otherwise they may spread it further through physical contact with others or through sharing food/drink items/etc…<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> All personnel coming into contact with <i>SCP-17751</i> must wear protective gear, including gloves, face masks, and full body suits. Any individuals suspected of being infected with the parasite are to be immediately quarantined and treated with appropriate antibiotics.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of the parasite, all contaminated items (including clothing and bedding) must be incinerated or otherwise destroyed. Additionally, any individuals who have come into contact with an infected individual must be monitored for signs of infection for at least two weeks after their last exposure.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17751.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to study <i>SCP-17751</i> in a controlled environment. However, the experiment was quickly terminated when several researchers began exhibiting signs of infection. All personnel involved were immediately quarantined and treated for the parasite; fortunately, all subjects recovered fully after being administered appropriate antibiotics.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17751.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17751</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17751</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me why you infect people?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17751</i>:</b> I infect people because they are weak and vulnerable. They need to be reminded of their mortality, so that they can appreciate life more fully.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17751.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17751</i> on human subjects. Six volunteers were infected with the parasite and monitored for changes in behavior over a period of two weeks. During this time, all six individuals exhibited signs of paranoia, depression, suicidal ideation, and violent outbursts. Additionally, four of the six reported hearing voices similar to those previously described by <i>SCP-17751</i>'s victims.<br><br>At the conclusion of the experiment all six subjects were successfully treated with antibiotics and released; however it is unknown if any long-term psychological damage has been done as a result of their infection.</div>
