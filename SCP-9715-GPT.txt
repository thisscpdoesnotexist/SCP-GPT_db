When police officers arrived at the house they saw a man looking into <i>SCP-9715</i> and immediately called for backup due to his erratic behavior and his refusal to move away from <i>SCP-9715</i> despite being told multiple times that he would be arrested if he didn't comply with their orders. When more officers arrived at the scene they attempted to remove him from <i>SCP-9715</i> but were unsuccessful due to his extreme strength and resistance towards them, resulting in several injuries on both sides before one officer managed to shoot him in the leg causing him [DATA EXPUNGED]. After being shot he fell out of <i>SCP-9715</i> bleeding heavily from his wound when personnel attempted CPR on him but it was unsuccessful as [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in █ deaths among personnel involved including one officer who had been close enough that she was infected by whatever killed everyone else involved with this incident (see addendum).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9715</i> is a mirror with someone stuck inside.

It was crazy! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Did you see anything else? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Well after that everything went black for a while until I woke up in an ambulance with some paramedics next to me telling me that my leg got hurt somehow but it didn't really hurt or anything so then the ambulance took me here [REDACTED] Hospital where they gave me some pills for my leg which didn't really help much… Then this lady came in with a bunch of people wearing hazmat suits and told everyone not to panic because we had been exposed to something dangerous but she couldn't explain why because if she did anyone who wasn't authorized would be killed by [DATA EXPUNGED]. After that we were all put into quarantine until they could figure out how exactly we got infected… But it's been almost 2 months now since we've been here and no one has figured out how yet… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview ended shortly after this due to Mr. █████████ becoming increasingly agitated as he spoke about his situation before attempting suicide by jumping through one of the windows on his room which failed due to being made of bulletproof glass resulting in him injuring himself further before being sedated by medical personnel on site (see addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9715.3 : </h3>Experiment Log :</div>
