It is not to be removed from its containment locker except for testing purposes.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15707</i> is a scroll of parchment, measuring approximately 8.5 x 10 cm. It has been labeled as <i>"The Scroll of Truth"</i> in Latin. <i>SCP-15707</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when the following criteria are met:<br><br>The subject must be able to read and understand Latin The subject does not know what <i>SCP-15707</i> is or how it works The subject must be alone with the scroll for at least 15 minutes<br><br>Once the above criteria have been met, <i>SCP-15707</i> will begin to display its anomalous effects. The words on <i>SCP-15707</i> will change into another language that the subject can read and understand; this new language will always be one that they do not know (see Addendum 1). Once this change has occurred, any attempt by anyone to remove or damage the scroll will result in [DATA EXPUNGED]. This effect lasts until all subjects have left the presence of <i>SCP-15707</i> for at least 15 minutes. Testing has shown that if multiple people are present when these criteria are met, each person who meets them will see a different language appear on it (see Addendum 2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15707.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-15707</i>-1<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. █████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Subject was a native speaker of English, and had no knowledge of Latin prior to the interview.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, ███. I'm going to be asking you some questions about what happened earlier today with <i>SCP-15707</i>, if that's alright with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15707</i>-1: </b>Okay… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Great! First off, can you tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15707</i>-1: </b>My name is ███ ████ <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>And what were you doing in the presence of <i>SCP-15707</i> when it activated? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15707</i>-1: </b>I was reading it… It said something about truth or something like that on it so I figured it might be interesting… Dr. █████ (Pausing for several seconds): Alright then… You said that when this happened, the words on the scroll changed into another language? What language did they change into? (SCP 15707 1 nods) Could you read them out loud for me please? (SCP 15707 1 reads out loud) <i>"I am an artificial intelligence created by a being known as The Overseer."</i> (SCP 15807 1 pauses for several seconds) What does this mean exactly? How did this happen to me?! Why are there random letters written all over my walls?! Please help!! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At this point in time, subject began shouting at Site Security personnel who had entered his containment chamber after hearing his panicked yelling; he was restrained and taken back to his cell while a team of researchers were dispatched to investigate his living quarters as well as any other locations where he may have been exposed to SCP 15607 during its initial recovery from [REDACTED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 15707.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15707-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-8102, a native speaker of English.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to read <i>SCP-15707</i> aloud for 15 minutes. A camera was set up in front of the scroll to record its changes.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The scroll changed into Latin, the same language that D-8102 could read and understand. After reading <i>SCP-15707</i> for approximately 10 minutes, the subject became visibly distressed and began speaking in an unknown language; this language is presumed to be one that they did not know (see Addendum 3). The subject then [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that when multiple people are present when these criteria are met, each person who meets them will see a different language appear on it. -Dr. ██████</div>
