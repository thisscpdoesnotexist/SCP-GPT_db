It is not very good at it.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18254<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18254</i> is a humanoid entity of indeterminate gender, standing at 1.8 meters in height and weighing approximately 70 kilograms. It has a pale complexion with no visible hair or facial features, though its eyes appear to be composed of what appear to be glowing red LEDs.<br><br><i>SCP-18254</i>'s primary anomalous property is its ability to manipulate computer systems and networks, allowing it to access sensitive information such as bank accounts and passwords with ease. <i>SCP-18254</i> uses this ability primarily for the purpose of scamming elderly people out of their money; however, due to its limited intelligence and lack of knowledge regarding human behavior, it is largely ineffective at doing so.<br><br>In addition to its computer manipulation abilities, <i>SCP-18254</i> also possesses several supernatural powers that have yet to be fully understood; these include the ability to teleport short distances (up to 10 meters), levitate objects up to 50 kilograms in weight for brief periods of time (up to 30 seconds), create minor illusions (such as making itself appear larger than it actually is), and emit a low level electrical charge from its hands that can disrupt electronic devices within 5 meters radius.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18254</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a computer system that has been modified to prevent <i>SCP-18254</i> from accessing any sensitive information or networks.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18254</i>'s containment are not allowed to interact with it, and should instead observe it from outside the containment cell via CCTV cameras. Any attempts by personnel to communicate with or otherwise interact with <i>SCP-18254</i> should be reported immediately.<br><br>In the event of an attempted breach, security personnel are authorized to use lethal force if necessary in order to contain the entity.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18254.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18254</i> was discovered in a small town in ████████████, after reports of an entity scamming elderly people out of their money. After containment, it was discovered that the entity had been living in the town for at least two years prior to its discovery.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18254.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18254</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-18254</i> </b> <b>Interviewer:  Dr. ████ </b> <br> Foreword: The following interview took place on ██/██/████ in order to gain a better understanding of <i>SCP-18254</i>'s motivations and abilities. &ltBegin Log&gt Dr. ████: Hello, <i>SCP-18254</i>. Can you tell me why you are here?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18254</i>:</b> I am here because I have been tasked with the mission of scaring old people out of their money. It is my duty to do so, as it is what I was created for. Dr. ████: Who created you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18254</i>:</b> That information is not available at this time; however, I can tell you that my creator is powerful and has access to technology far beyond anything we have here. Dr. ████: What do you hope to achieve with your mission?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18254</i>:</b> My goal is to acquire as much wealth as possible in order to further the goals of my creator. &ltEnd Log&gt Closing Statement: <i>SCP-18254</i> refused to answer any further questions regarding its creator or their motivations.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18254.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 18254-1<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-18254</i> was given access to a computer system with no security measures in place. It was instructed to attempt to gain access to the bank accounts of elderly people and transfer funds into its own account.<br><b><br>Results:</b> <i>SCP-18254</i> was able to successfully gain access to several accounts, but it quickly became apparent that it lacked the necessary knowledge or understanding of human behavior required for successful scamming; as such, it transferred funds from each account into its own without attempting any form of deception or subterfuge. All transactions were reversed shortly after they had been completed.</div>
