People die when they hear the final punchline.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9515</i> was found in [REDACTED] on ██/██/1996. Reports had been coming in from the town of a <i>"Mr. Killian"</i> telling jokes to passersby, and anyone who heard the punchline dying shortly afterwards. An embedded agent was reported dead upon arrival, and several members of the local police force were found dead inside of the town's police station with [REDACTED]. The Foundation was alerted after reports of several people being killed by a joke that nobody could remember went viral online.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9515.1 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br>The following is an interview between Dr. Williamson and <i>SCP-9515</i> after the subject was brought to Site-19.<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <Begin Log> Dr.<br> Williamson: Hello there, 9515. I want to ask you some questions about your old life before you came here so we can better understand what you are now, okay?<br> <i>SCP-9515</i>: Certainly, my dear boy! [Laughs] Now let me see if I can remember that joke about the… oh yes! Once there were two pigeons sitting on a branch together when one looks over at the other and says <i>"I love you."</i> The first pigeon replies <i>"You can't be serious?"</i> And then they both drop dead of exhaustion from laughing so hard! [Laughs] Oh yes, it's brilliant isn't it? That's why I call it… wait a second… Dr.<br> Williamson: What is it?<br> <i>SCP-9515</i>: What do you mean what is it?! It's my joke! You've heard this joke before?! Oh no no no no nononono NOOOOOO!! [<i>SCP-9515</i> claws at its head for several seconds before collapsing onto its side and dying.] <End Log><br> Closing Statement: No more than 30 seconds after <i>SCP-9515</i> died from laughter, D-1055 entered his containment cell carrying a set of wireless speakers in each hand. D-1055 had been instructed beforehand that he would hear something funny as soon as he entered the room; however he was never informed of what kind of thing would make him laugh or die in this way as to prevent information about <i>SCP-9515</i> from leaking out into public knowledge (see Addendum 9511). As instructed by researchers assigned to monitor him through hidden cameras scattered around Site 19, D-1055 played the audio file attached at ~~\Documents\SCP_Test_Logs\AudioLog1 - Copy 1\ApprovedTestLogs/9600/9605/9605A1_3b8d7c80_audio2___SpeakersOff__CamerasOn___English(US)\recordingsound__[SCP].wav~~ for ██ minutes before succumbing to death via laughter on ██/██/1996 . After confirming that D20555 has expired due to unknown causes (later found out to be caused by laughter), researchers proceeded with their attempts at containing 9515 using standard methods developed during previous encounters with similar SCPs such as 015 , 027 , 029 , 033 , etc (see Document 9600) but failed due to one or more unforeseen circumstances each time resulting in numerous casualties among Foundation personnel and civilians alike requiring cover up operations being carried out by MTF Gamma 7 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>) agents working under direct supervision of O5 Command . To date there have been ███ confirmed deaths caused directly or indirectly by exposure to 9513's anomalous properties including civilian casualties<br><br><h3>Addendum 9515.2 :</h3> Audio Log 1<br><br>The following is an audio log of the contents of ~~<i>SCP-9515</i>'s cell at Site-19 after D-1055 played the file on his way into <i>SCP-9515</i>'s containment cell.~~<br><br>+ Show Audio Log 1 - Hide Audio Log 1 [BEGIN LOG] Dr.<br> Williamson: Hello 9515, how are you feeling today?<br> <i>SCP-9515</i>: I'm… fine, I suppose… Dr.<br> Williamson: That's good to hear! Now there's something that we need to ask you about your joke. Did somebody tell it to you, or did you make it up yourself?<br> <i>SCP-9515</i>: What do you mean, <i>"tell"</i> it? It was just a joke! Who would tell someone a joke like that?! And how would they know what the punchline was anyway? That doesn't make any sense! Dr.<br> Williamson: No no no 9515, we're not accusing anyone of anything! We just want to know where this joke came from because if people keep on hearing it and dying from laughter after hearing the final punchline then someone else is going to figure out what happened and put two and two together so we need some information about where this came from so that can avoid more unnecessary casualties in the future okay?<br> <i>SCP-9515</i>: I see… well then perhaps if I told someone else my bird jokes they'd be able to find out who told me my one big final laugh huh? Well</div>
