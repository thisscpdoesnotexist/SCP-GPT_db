Access to <i>SCP-17072</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. All lemons used for testing purposes must be disposed of immediately after use, and all metal created from <i>SCP-17072</i> must be kept in a separate containment unit away from other materials.<br><br>Any personnel found attempting to use <i>SCP-17072</i> for personal gain will be subject to disciplinary action.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17072</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that allows lemons to be used as a construction material. The affected lemons are able to form into any desired shape, and have the strength of steel when hardened.<br><br>When a lemon is exposed to <i>SCP-17072</i>, it will rapidly increase in size and transform into a solid mass of metal resembling steel. This transformation takes approximately 1 minute for each lemon. In addition, the metal formed from <i>SCP-17072</i> has been found to have properties similar to those of steel, such as extreme durability and tensile strength.<br><br>The anomalous effects of <i>SCP-17072</i> can be reversed by exposing the material formed from it to temperatures above 1000°C (1832°F). At this temperature, the material will become liquid and revert back into its original state as a lemon. However, due to its extreme heat resistance, this process must be done carefully so as not damage or destroy other materials around it.<br><br>Once created with <i>SCP-17072</i>'s effects, the metal can then be shaped or molded into whatever form desired by conventional means via welding or casting processes; however these methods are not required for the initial formation of said metal from lemons affected by <i>SCP-17072</i>'s anomaly.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17072.1 : </h3><br><br>Testing of <i>SCP-17072</i> has shown that it is capable of creating metal objects with a variety of shapes and sizes. However, due to the limited amount of lemons available for testing, further experimentation is needed to determine its full capabilities.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17072.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Dr. ████████, Researcher at Site-██<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████████<br><br><h3>Addendum 17072.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 17072-A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>10 lemons.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was exposed to <i>SCP-17072</i>'s anomaly and observed for 1 minute.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The lemons increased in size, becoming solid metal objects resembling steel. The objects were then tested for strength and durability by a hammer, with no visible signs of damage or deformation.</div>
