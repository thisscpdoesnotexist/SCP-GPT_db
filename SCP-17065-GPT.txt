The building must remain structurally sound and no personnel are to enter without permission from a Level 3 or higher researcher.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-17065</i> are not permitted to interact with them directly; instead, they should observe their behavior from a distance and document any changes in activity or behavior. Any attempts at communication should be done through nonverbal means such as hand gestures or written notes.<br><br>In the event of an emergency situation involving <i>SCP-17065</i>, personnel are advised to use nonlethal force if necessary in order to contain them until further instructions can be provided by a Level 3 or higher researcher.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17065</i> is a family of humanoid entities measuring approximately six inches in height. They are composed of an unknown material, resembling a type of plastic or rubber. <i>SCP-17065</i> reside beneath the floorboards of a residential house located in Manchester, UK.<br><br>The family consists of six <br><br><b>members: </b>two adults (designated <i>SCP-17065</i>-1 and <i>SCP-17065</i>-2) and four children (designated <i>SCP-17065</i>-3 through -6). All members possess rudimentary intelligence, but their primary focus appears to be the construction and maintenance of various mechanical devices within their home. The purpose or function of these devices is currently unknown.<br><br><i>SCP-17065</i> have been observed to communicate using a series of high pitched chirps that appear to be language specific to them; however, attempts at communication with personnel have failed due to their inability to understand English or any other human language. It should also be noted that they display no fear towards humans when encountered and do not attempt to flee from personnel unless provoked.<br><br>When threatened by personnel, <i>SCP-17065</i> will retreat into small crevices within the walls or floorboards where they cannot easily be reached by personnel without causing structural damage to the building itself; thus far, no such damage has occurred during containment operations as all threats posed by personnel have been nonlethal in nature.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17065.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a small device constructed by <i>SCP-17065</i> was discovered in the vicinity of their home. The device is composed of several interlocking pieces and appears to be some form of mechanical puzzle. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the device functions as a miniature clockwork mechanism, with each piece representing a different hour on an analog clock face. It is currently unknown what purpose this serves for <i>SCP-17065</i> or if it has any connection to their behavior or activities.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17065.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-17065</i>-1<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17065</i>-1 was successfully contained and interviewed by personnel. During the course of the interview, it became apparent that <i>SCP-17065</i> are aware of their anomalous nature and have developed a culture around it. When asked about their purpose or goals in life, <i>SCP-17065</i>-1 <br><br><b>stated: </b><i>"We exist to serve our master. He is the one who brought us here and has given us this task."</i> No further information could be obtained from <i>SCP-17065</i> regarding their master or any other details about their origin or purpose.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17065.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>On ██/██/████, a Level 3 researcher attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-17065</i> using a series of hand gestures and nonverbal cues. The attempt was unsuccessful, as the entities did not seem to understand or respond in any meaningful way.</div>
