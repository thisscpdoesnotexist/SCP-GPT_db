The Foundation was alerted of the anomaly and sent in MTF Eta-11 (aka <i>"The Cleaners"</i>) to investigate the area and retrieve the anomaly for study.<br><br><i>SCP-9968</i> is highly aggressive, attacking anything within its sight without hesitation. <i>SCP-9968</i> does not seem to require food or water, as it has been seen killing prey for sport rather than sustenance. It seems to prefer hunting down humans and other large mammals such as bears and wolves; however it will attack any living thing that enters its territory regardless of size or species (See Addendum 9968/1).<br><br><i>SCP-9968</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an organism is killed by <i>SCP-9968</i>'s claws or teeth; after killing an organism, <i>SCP-9968</i> will take on physical traits of the deceased creature (i.e., fur coloration, height/weight ratio) until another animal dies near it again at which point it will resume taking on characteristics of whatever animal died last near it (See Experiment Logs 9969/1 through 9969/5). The only way to stop this cycle from repeating itself is if no living organisms are present around <i>SCP-9668</i> at all times; however this makes containment extremely difficult due to its nature as an apex predator in North America making most environments unsuitable for long term containment due to lack of prey animals nearby once they have all been killed off by SCP - 9668 . This leads us back into our current situation where we are forced to keep several hundred D class personnel on hand at any given time just so we can keep feeding them directly into 9668's mouth so we don't run out of food supplies here at Site 19 . We've tried using robotic drones but every time one gets close enough for us try testing whether [DATA EXPUNGED] happens like with D class personnel , 9668 just tears them apart like they were made out of paper mache . We're currently working on some kind of automated system that would allow us feed D class directly into his mouth without having someone actually there but I'm sure you'll understand why I'm reluctant about going ahead with something like that until we know more about<br><br><h3>Addendum 9968.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, a former member of MTF Eta-11<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>[DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>[DATA EXPUNGED] was one of the first members of MTF Eta-11 to encounter <i>SCP-9968</i> during its initial containment. He was injured during the initial incident and has since been reassigned to other duties within the Foundation. This interview is being conducted as part of an ongoing investigation into whether or not <i>SCP-9968</i>'s effects are memetic in nature and if so, how they can be used to our advantage in containing it. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello there Mr… uh… what was your name again? [DATA <br><br><b>EXPUNGED]: </b>It's ████ sir; I'm sorry I forgot my nametag this morning . <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Oh yes, that's right; well then let's get started shall we? Now you were there when 968 was first brought into custody correct? What happened exactly? [DATA <br><br><b>EXPUNGED]: </b>Yes sir I was one of the first people on scene when we got word about a possible K class scenario in Canada . We arrived at the location and found this raccoon just tearing apart a bear like it wasn't even there . We tried shooting it but our rounds just bounced off its hide like they were made out of rubber or something . Then 968 turned towards us and charged so we had no choice but to open fire on him with everything we had while trying not to hit any civilians who might have been nearby at the time . Next thing I know , he looks right at me with those big glowing eyes and hisses before launching himself straight at me like some kind of furry rocket ship! Thankfully my team mates managed to pull me out from under him before he could do any serious damage but by that point he'd already taken off half my left arm with his teeth; after that things kind of went downhill from there… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears <i>SCP-9968</i> may be able to influence nearby organisms through unknown means resulting in them attacking anything near them until they are killed by another organism nearby which causes SCP - 9968 's anomalous properties manifest once more (see Experiment Logs 9969/1 through 9969/5). Further testing is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn however due both logistical issues as well as ethical concerns about exposing D class personnel or other animals for testing purposes (See Addendum 9967/2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9968.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Logs 9969/1 through 9969/5:<br><br>Experiment Logs 9969/1 through 9969/5:</div>
