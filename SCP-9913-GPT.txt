No personnel are to enter <i>SCP-9913</i>'s containment cell without the approval of Dr. ██████, and any personnel who have sustained injuries from <i>SCP-9913</i> are not permitted to enter its containment cell until they have been treated for their injuries.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9913</i> is an organic metal tree of unknown origin with prismatic metal leaves. The trunk of the tree is 1.5 meters in diameter, and the branches extend to a height of 3 meters before branching again into more leaves. The branches are hollow and can be used as pipes for liquids or gases, and have been observed to function as such in testing.<br><br><i>SCP-9913</i> was discovered by Agent ██████ in [REDACTED] after reports from local civilians about a strange plant that was growing out of their water supply pipes. <i>SCP-9913</i>'s anomalous properties were discovered when Agent ██████ attempted to remove it from the water supply system using standard tools; instead, he found that he had unintentionally removed several portions of his own arm along with the pipe segments connected to them. After this incident, <i>SCP-9913</i> was contained at Site-██ under observation until its properties could be better understood; however, further attempts at removal resulted in similar results (see Addendum 9913a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9913.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 9913.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Agent ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So, tell me what happened when you tried to remove the tree from the water supply pipes. Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>Well, I went in there with a chainsaw and started cutting it out of the pipes, like I've done for other things before. But then… well, I don't know how to describe it exactly… but I felt like something was wrong, so I stopped and looked at my arm. And that's when it hit me; my arm was gone! There were just these metal pipe segments where my arm should have been! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>How did you feel about this? Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>At first? Terrified! It hurt like hell too; there was blood everywhere and bits of flesh sticking out of the metal where they'd been ripped off by the saw or whatever that thing is made out of… But then after a while I got used to it - or at least as used to it as you can get with half your goddamn arm missing - so we just put some bandages on me and called 911 for an ambulance. They took me right away to [REDACTED] General Hospital , where they patched me up pretty good - except for some scarring around where my fingers used to be - and gave me a new prosthetic hand that looks almost exactly like my old one did before all this happened . The doctors even said they could do cosmetic surgery on my shoulder if I wanted them too… but honestly? After seeing what those things are made out of? No way am I letting them near any part of myself again . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What about <i>SCP-9913</i> itself ? Did you try removing more parts from <i>SCP-9913</i> ? Agent <br><br><b>██████: </b>We didn't try anything else after that first time; not until we knew more about what had happened anyway . We figured maybe if we waited long enough , whatever had taken hold would let go on its own , but no such luck . In fact , now there's even more branches coming off than before ! (At this point in his interview , Agent ███'s voice became slightly muffled due to his hands being covered by a towel.) Dr.(?): Excuse me sir ; is everything okay ? (Agent removes towel from his face) Agent(?): Yeah sorry about that Doc ; must have gotten soap in one eye or something . Anyway yeah ; since then we've just been sitting around waiting for someone smarter than us to come along who can figure this thing out without getting anyone else hurt … <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview with Doctor [REDACTED], several additional tests were conducted using D-Class personnel instead of Foundation agents; however, none resulted in any further anomalous effects beyond those observed during initial containment procedures (see Addendum 9913a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9913.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 9913-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9913, a Class-D personnel with a history of substance abuse.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to approach <i>SCP-9913</i> and attempt to remove it from its containment cell. The subject was equipped with a standard Foundation firefighting suit and gloves, as well as an emergency oxygen supply in case he needed to retreat from the area. Results were observed through the use of thermal imaging equipment.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject approached <i>SCP-9913</i> and attempted to remove it by using his hands; however, he quickly found that several portions of his arms had been removed along with the pipe segments connected to them (see Addendum 9913a). After this incident, subject immediately retreated from the area and began applying pressure bandages to his wounds before requesting medical attention for them.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that any attempts at removal or destruction of <i>SCP-9913</i> will result in similar results; however, we have yet not determined how these effects are achieved or how they can be reversed without damaging other parts of the tree itself (see Experiment Logs 1 - 6). - Dr ██████<br><br></div>
