I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-11218</i>. Can you tell me when you first saw it? ███: I don't know what that thing is, but I remember seeing it on the field when I was playing ball with my friends as a kid… We were all out there one day, and we heard something fall from the sky and land behind home plate… It was weird because we didn't see anything fall from above us or even hear anything that sounded like an object falling from above us… We just heard this loud thud behind home plate, like someone dropped something really heavy on the ground… Then we saw this bat leaning against one of those wooden poles they use to keep score at baseball games and thought it looked cool so we picked it up… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What happened next? ███: Well, my friend Bill picked up <i>SCP-11218</i> first so he could try swinging it around since none of us had ever seen a bat before… He took his first swing at one of those big plastic barrels they have set up near second base during practice sessions… And then suddenly he collapsed on the ground and started twitching around like crazy while screaming in pain or something; blood started pouring out his eyes too as if someone stabbed him in them with needles or something… After that happened my other friends got scared and ran away while screaming for their parents to come pick them up because they thought Bill had been killed by lightning or some sort of freak accident or whatever; but then after about two minutes passed Bill suddenly stopped moving altogether and just laid there motionless on the ground until our parents came along to pick us all up later that day.. <br><br><b>Drs.: </b>Damn.. That's pretty fucked up if you ask me.. But anyway can you tell me anything else about what happened during your last game with your team? Maybe how many people were present there during your last game? Or maybe who else besides yourself played for your team back then?
