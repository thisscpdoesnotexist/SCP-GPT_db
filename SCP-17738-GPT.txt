It wears a black jumpsuit with yellow stripes.<br><br><i>SCP-17738</i>'s primary anomalous property is its ability to pilot a human-sized mecha suit of armor, referred to as <i>SCP-17738</i>-1. The mecha suit stands at 2 meters in height and has been outfitted with various weapons and tools, including an energy rifle capable of firing blasts of concussive force. <i>SCP-17738</i> can control the movements of the mecha suit through mental commands, allowing it to move around quickly and maneuver in combat scenarios.<br><br>When not piloting the mecha suit, <i>SCP-17738</i> will remain inactive until it detects potential threats or individuals that require assistance from it. When this occurs, <i>SCP-17738</i> will activate its mecha suit and attempt to neutralize any hostile entities or assist those in need if possible. If no threats are present when activated, SCP 17738 will deactivate itself after 5 minutes have passed without further incident occurring.<br><br>SCP 17738 does not appear to possess any other anomalous properties beyond those related to its piloting capabilities; however tests conducted on samples taken from its body have revealed traces of unknown compounds which may be responsible for some aspects of its behavior or abilities. Further testing is required before any conclusions can be made about these compounds' effects on SCP 17738's physiology or capabilities<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17738</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with an automated monitoring system capable of detecting any changes in <i>SCP-17738</i>'s behavior or activity levels.<br><br>In the event that SCP 17738 activates its mecha suit, personnel are to observe from a safe distance and take note of any unusual behaviors or activities it may display. If necessary, security personnel are authorized to use nonlethal force against SCP 17738 if it poses a threat to personnel or property. All attempts at communication with SCP 17738 should be made through the use of sign language; verbal communication has proven ineffective thus far.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17738.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17738</i> was observed engaging a group of hostile humans in combat. The entity displayed an impressive level of skill in piloting its mecha suit, using it to quickly dispatch the attackers and rescue any civilians present. After the incident concluded, SCP 17738 deactivated itself without further incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17738.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17738</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17738</i> was interviewed by Dr. ██████ in order to determine its origin and purpose. During the interview, SCP 17738 indicated that it had been created by an unknown entity to serve as a guardian of sorts for those in need of assistance. When asked why it had chosen to pilot a mecha suit, SCP 17738 responded that it felt more comfortable doing so than relying on its own strength or abilities.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17738.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17738.3-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17738</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-17738</i> was placed in a testing chamber and instructed to pilot its mecha suit.
