The exterior of the house appears to be unremarkable and no anomalous properties are present until an individual enters the property.<br><br>Once inside, any individual will immediately experience a sensation of being removed from existence and begin to slowly disappear from sight. This effect is not permanent, but individuals will remain invisible for up to one hour before reappearing in their original location within the house. During this time, any attempts at communication or interaction with other individuals outside of <i>SCP-21051</i> will fail due to the lack of visibility.<br><br>The interior of <i>SCP-21051</i> is unremarkable aside from its anomalous effects; however, further investigation has revealed that all furniture and objects within the household have been replaced with exact replicas made out of solidified air molecules that appear as normal objects upon entering the property. These replicas are non-anomalous and can be interacted with normally without any ill effects on those inside <i>SCP-21051</i>'s boundaries. <br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21051</i> is to be monitored by a team of two (2) personnel at all times. Access to the property is restricted and any individuals attempting to enter must be accompanied by an authorized personnel member.<br><br>In order to prevent accidental exposure, no unauthorized persons are allowed within the boundaries of <i>SCP-21051</i>. Any individuals found inside will be immediately removed and administered Class A amnestics before being released from containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21051.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a small group of individuals attempted to enter <i>SCP-21051</i> with the intent of looting the property. All individuals were immediately removed from the premises and administered Class A amnestics before being released from containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21051.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21051</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21051</i>'s previous owner, Mrs. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Can you tell me how you first discovered the anomalous properties of your house? <br><b><br>Mrs. ██████:</b> Well, it all started when I was cleaning one day and noticed that my furniture had been replaced by exact replicas made out of air molecules. I thought it was strange, but didn't think much of it until a few days later when I went to get something from the kitchen and suddenly disappeared! It was so weird; I could still hear people talking outside but couldn't see them or interact with them in any way. After a few minutes, I reappeared in the same spot and everything was back to normal. <br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Do you know of any other individuals who have experienced similar effects?<br><b><br>Mrs. ██████:</b> No, I don't think so. This only happened to me and it's been like that ever since I moved into this house.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21051.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #1:</b> <br><b>Subject:</b> D-8761, a male human aged 20.<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-21051</i> and remain within the property for one hour. <br><b>Results:</b> Upon entering the house, subject immediately began to disappear from sight and could not be seen or heard by personnel outside of <i>SCP-21051</i>'s boundaries. After one hour had passed, subject reappeared in his original location inside the house unharmed.</div>
