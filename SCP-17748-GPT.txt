It appears to be made of an unknown metal alloy, and its surface has been painted black.<br><br>When used on any object or material, <i>SCP-17748</i> will open it regardless of the object's composition or structural integrity. This includes objects that are normally impossible to open with conventional tools such as locks and safes, as well as materials such as concrete and steel. Furthermore, <i>SCP-17748</i> is capable of opening objects that should not be opened due to their contents being potentially hazardous; this includes items protected by supernatural means such as magical wards or curses.<br><br>It is currently unknown how <i>SCP-17748</i> functions; attempts at disassembling it have resulted in failure due to its anomalous properties preventing any form of tampering with its structure.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17748</i> is to be kept in a standard secure locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17748</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and must be approved by the Site Director.<br><br>Any objects opened using <i>SCP-17748</i> are to be immediately contained and secured for further study. Any personnel exposed to hazardous materials released from these objects are to receive medical attention as soon as possible.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17748.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of personnel led by Dr. █████ was sent to investigate reports of an unknown object located in the basement of an abandoned house. Upon arriving at the site, they discovered a locked door which could not be opened with conventional tools. After using <i>SCP-17748</i> on the door, it opened to reveal a large chamber filled with various artifacts and documents related to occult practices. The objects were immediately secured for further study and analysis.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17748.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> What can you tell me about <i>SCP-17748</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> It's a crowbar that can open anything… including things that should never be opened. We don't know how it works, but we've been able to contain the objects it opens and study them further.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Are there any known risks associated with using <i>SCP-17748</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> Yes, due to the nature of some of the objects it can open, exposure to hazardous materials is a possibility. We take every precaution to ensure that personnel are not exposed to these materials, but we cannot guarantee their safety.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17748.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> A standard steel door.<br><b><br>Result:</b> <i>SCP-17748</i> was able to open the door with minimal effort.
