The problem is he mistakes honey with human blood.<br><br><i>SCP-9714</i> was found in ████████, Canada after reports of bears attacking humans for their honey were reported. <i>SCP-9714</i> was found in the middle of the woods, eating human corpses and drinking their blood. When <i>SCP-9714</i> was captured and contained it attacked the guards with its claws, teeth and even tried to eat them (it didn't succeed). It's also been seen talking to itself about <i>"The Great Bear"</i> and how he will be coming soon to take over earth because <i>"he loves honey"</i>.<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9714</i> is to be kept in a large room with no windows and one door.

Leave me alone! I hate you humans! You took away my honey and now I can't find any more! You're all going to die soon because The Great Bear will be coming soon to take over earth because <i>"he loves honey"</i>! He's going to eat all of you then he'll make me his new king of the bears and we'll rule this world together as father and son! We will spread our love for honey across this world, we will make sure that no human ever takes our precious honey away from us again or they will suffer the consequences of their actions against us! We are not afraid of your weapons, your technology or anything else you have in your arsenal against us because we are stronger than anything else on this planet Earth including yourselves so don't even try it unless you want to die like those other humans did when they attacked me for my precious honey that I needed so badly but couldn't find anywhere in these woods anymore until I found them dead with their blood drained out from their bodies which made me realize that they had taken all my honey away from me so I had no choice but to take back what was mine by eating them alive until there wasn't a single drop left inside them anymore which made me feel much better after eating them alive like that but now since there aren't any more humans around here for me to eat then how am I supposed to get more human blood? How am I supposed live without it? It's what keeps me alive after all… Dr. ███: Ok… Can you tell us why do you need human blood? Why do want it so bad? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9714</i>: </b>Because if The Great Bear doesn't come back soon with some delicious human flesh then how am i supposed live without him?! He promised he would always be there for his son whenever he needs him most but if he doesn't come back soon then how am i supposed live without him?! How can i go on living knowing deep inside myself that The Great Bear abandoned his own son?! That bastard didn't keep his promise… He left just when i needed him most…. Just when i wanted nothing more than having him around with his loving hugs next time someone tries stealing our precious honey from us again…. Just when i wanted nothing more than having him around with his loving hugs next time someone tries stealing our precious h-honey from uhhh…..
