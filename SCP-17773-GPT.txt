For your safety, please abandon the premise immediately.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17773<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17773</i> is an anomalous phenomenon in which a breach of narrative occurs, resulting in the sudden appearance of objects and entities that are not consistent with the current story. These objects and entities will manifest as either physical or digital forms, depending on the context of their appearance. They will typically be hostile towards any living organism within proximity to them, often attempting to cause harm or destruction to those present.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-17773</i> is currently unknown; however, it appears to originate from some form of extradimensional space beyond our own reality. It is theorized that this space contains a variety of different stories and narratives, all vying for dominance over one another. When one narrative becomes too powerful or influential within our reality, it can break through into ours and cause a breach in narrative continuity.<br><br>When such a breach occurs, any living beings present will experience extreme disorientation as they try to make sense out of what is happening around them. Objects and entities from other realities may appear suddenly without warning; these objects have been known to range from mundane items such as furniture pieces or books to more exotic creatures like dragons or giant robots made out of pure energy. In any case, these anomalies are always hostile towards anything organic nearby and must be dealt with accordingly by personnel trained for such situations.<br><br>Due to its unpredictable nature and potential threat level posed by <i>SCP-17773</i> breaches, containment protocols have been set up around locations where breaches have occurred before in order prevent further incidents from occurring again in the future<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Any location where a breach of narrative has occurred is to be immediately cordoned off and monitored by Foundation personnel. All civilians within the area are to be evacuated and given Class-A amnestics before being released back into the general population.<br><br>Any objects or entities that manifest as a result of <i>SCP-17773</i> breaches are to be contained, studied, and neutralized if necessary. If any living creatures appear as part of a breach, they must also be contained for further study; however, extreme caution should always be taken when dealing with these anomalies due to their unpredictable nature.<br><br>In order to prevent further breaches from occurring in the future, research teams have been dispatched around the world in order to locate and contain any potential sources<br><br><h3> Addendum 17773.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a breach of narrative occurred in the city of [REDACTED], resulting in the appearance of several objects and entities from other realities. Foundation personnel were able to contain all anomalies without any casualties or civilian knowledge; however, further research into this phenomenon is still needed to better understand its nature and origin.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17773.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17773</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was dispatched to a location where a breach in narrative had recently occurred. Upon arriving at the scene, they encountered an entity that had manifested as part of the breach. After subduing it and containing it within an isolated chamber, personnel proceeded to interview it in order to gain further insight into <i>SCP-17773</i>'s origin and nature. The following is a transcript of their conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us what you are?<br><b><br>Entity:</b> I am an entity from another reality. I have been sent here by my masters in order to spread chaos and destruction throughout your world.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What are your masters?<br><b><br>Entity:</b> They are beings of immense power and knowledge. They seek to bring about the end of this world in order to make way for their own.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Why do they wish to do this?<br><b><br>Entity:</b> Because they believe that your world is flawed and must be destroyed in order for theirs to flourish. They have sent me here to carry out their will.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17773.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was dispatched to investigate the possible source of <i>SCP-17773</i>. Upon arriving at the site, they discovered a large stone structure resembling an ancient temple. Upon entering the building, they were immediately beset by various creatures and objects from other realities; these ranged from giant spiders to sentient machines made out of pure energy. Despite their best efforts, all members of the team were killed in the ensuing battle.<br><br>The cause of this breach is still unknown; however, further investigation into this matter is currently underway in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring again in the future.</div>
