I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-11731</i> and the hurricane that destroyed your house a few years ago, is that okay? <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>Yeah, go ahead. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>How did you get <i>SCP-11731</i>? <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>I got it from my boss at work, he said he was going to use it in his house because his air conditioner broke down and he didn't have money to fix it so he gave it to me for free as a gift or something like that I don't know why though because I already had an air conditioner at home so I just put it in my basement and forgot about it until the hurricane hit then when the power went out in my house after the storm passed over me and my family were trapped in our living room with no way of escaping because our front door was blocked by debris from the hurricane then all of a sudden this bright light appeared behind us followed by a loud noise we turned around and saw this thing floating there with bright lights coming out of its sides we were scared as hell but when we calmed down enough to look at what was floating there more carefully we noticed that one side had an AC outlet on it so after trying everything else first like calling 911 for help or using flashlights for light or even trying to dig through all of the debris blocking our front door we decided to plug this thing into an outlet on one side which made another outlet appear on its other side then after plugging both sides into outlets on opposite walls our living room lit up brighter than any light bulb could ever make along with turning cold enough where snow started falling inside while also stopping rain from pouring outside also making wind stop blowing outside too but not before knocking over trees making them crash through houses killing people who were still stuck inside their houses during Hurricane Sandy which is what they called this storm now do you know anything else about how this thing works? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>No, thank you very much for your time today Mr. [REDACTED], if you could just wait here until someone escorts you back home please sir… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement:<i>"After reviewing security footage taken during Hurricane Sandy's landfall near Site 19's location ,it has been confirmed that <i>SCP-11731</i> caused Hurricane Sandy."</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 11731.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 11731-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-11731, a male of African descent.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to turn on <i>SCP-11731</i> and set the temperature to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Subject was then instructed to sit in front of <i>SCP-11731</i> for five minutes. After five minutes had passed, subject was removed from <i>SCP-11731</i>'s range of effect and told that the experiment is over. Subject asked if he could stay longer inside of <i>SCP-11731</i>'s range of effect, but request was denied due to safety concerns. After leaving the area affected by <i>SCP-11731</i>, subject claimed that it felt <i>"refreshing"</i> inside of the area affected by 11731 for some reason. After being questioned about his well being after leaving the area affected by 11721, subject claimed that he felt <i>"better than ever"</i>. Test #: 11732-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-11872, a female of Caucasian descent with blonde hair and blue eyes. (Note this test is done on purpose because it will test whether or not eye color affects how people react when exposed to SCP - 11732) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous test except 11872 has green eyes instead of blue ones like she normally does . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Same as previous test except 11872 claims that she feels more relaxed than before entering into the area affected by SCP - 11732 Test #: 1173 2 - 1 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous tests except this time we're testing if skin color affects how people react when exposed to SCP – 1173 2 . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subjects claim they feel more relaxed than before entering into the area affected by 1173 2 . Test #: 1173 3 - 1 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous tests except this time we're testing if gender affects how people react when exposed to 1173 3 . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subjects claim they feel more relaxed than before entering into the area affected by 11 73 3 . Test #s 1 1734 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 & 19 were all repeats with no significant changes in results Test 20 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>This time we're testing what happens when someone who isn't human enters into an area effected by SC P – 111 73 2 . We've chosen Agent ██████ because he's our best agent at hand so far and also because he has brown hair which I have noticed is very common among humans so I thought it would be smart for us to see what happens if someone with brown hair enters an are effected b y 111 73 2 since most humans have brown hair anyway Results Agent ████████ entered an are effected b y 111 73 2 just like all other subjects did but instead o f feeling refreshed after leaving th e are affe cted b y 111 73 2 Agent ████████ started screaming in pain while throwing up blood everywhere while also having multiple seizures until death occurred approximately 5 minutes later</div>
