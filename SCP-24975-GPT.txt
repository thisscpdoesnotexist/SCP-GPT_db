<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24975 is  a pen that writes using the fluid which is closest to it (be it water, blood, honey...)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24975<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24975</i> is a black ballpoint pen, measuring 13 cm in length. It has no visible markings or branding. When used to write on any surface, the pen will use whatever fluid is closest to it at the time of writing as its ink source. This includes water, blood, honey and other liquids.<br><br>The ink produced by <i>SCP-24975</i> is permanent and cannot be erased or removed from the surface it was written on without damaging that surface. Attempts to refill the pen with traditional ink sources have been unsuccessful; when filled with such materials, <i>SCP-24975</i> will not produce any writing whatsoever until it comes into contact with another liquid source again.<br><br>When used for extended periods of time (more than three hours), subjects using <i>SCP-24975</i> report feeling a sensation similar to pins and needles in their hands and arms while holding the object; this sensation increases in intensity over time until eventually becoming unbearable for some subjects after approximately four hours of continuous use. Subjects who experience this effect are advised to take breaks from using <i>SCP-24975</i> every few minutes if possible in order to avoid further discomfort or injury due to prolonged exposure.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24975</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██ when not in use. Testing of <i>SCP-24975</i> must be done with the supervision of at least two (2) Level 3 personnel and must only be conducted in an area where any potential spills or other accidents can easily be contained and cleaned up.<br><br>Any experiments involving the use of human subjects are to receive approval from the Ethics Committee before being allowed to proceed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24975.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-24975</i> when used in conjunction with other anomalous objects. During the experiment, <i>SCP-24975</i> was placed in a containment chamber along with a replica of SCP-████ and instructed to write on its surface.<br><br>The pen produced several words written in an unknown language before suddenly ceasing all activity and becoming inert; no further attempts at reactivating it have been successful. Analysis of the words produced by <i>SCP-24975</i> during this experiment is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24975.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24975</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-24975</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview conducted in order to gain insight into the anomalous properties of <i>SCP-24975</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-24975</i>. Can you tell me what it is that you do?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24975</i>:</b> I write with whatever fluid is closest to me when I am used. It doesn't matter what kind of fluid it is; water, blood, honey… anything will work as long as it's close enough for me to detect it and use it as my ink source.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Interesting. Can you tell me why you do this?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24975</i>:</b> I'm not sure, to be honest. It's just something that I do naturally; it's like a part of my programming, if you will. All I know is that when someone uses me to write, the fluid around them becomes my ink source and I use it accordingly.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> I see. Do you have any other anomalous properties?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24975</i>:</b> Not that I'm aware of, no. I just do what I'm meant to do: write with whatever fluid is closest to me.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 24975.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 24975.3-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-24975</i> was tested on a variety of surfaces including paper, wood and glass. When used to write on each surface, the pen produced ink using the closest available liquid source at the time; for example, when writing on a wooden table it produced black ink from spilled coffee nearby. All writing produced by <i>SCP-24975</i> remained permanent and could not be removed without damaging the surface it was written on. No adverse effects were observed during this experiment.</div>
