No personnel are to enter <i>SCP-9717</i>'s containment cell without Level 4 authorization.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9717</i> is a large pit, approximately 10 meters in diameter, made out of a fleshy material. <i>SCP-9717</i> is located in the middle of a field at [REDACTED], and has been there since at least 18██.<br><br><i>SCP-9717</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when any human being comes within 5 meters of it. When this happens, the subject will feel an extreme sense of pleasure and euphoria for approximately 1 minute before falling into <i>SCP-9717</i>'s depths. If more than one person enters <i>SCP-9717</i> at once, they will all experience the same symptoms simultaneously; however, each individual will only be affected by <i>SCP-9717</i> once per day.<br><br><i>SCP-9717</i> was discovered after reports from nearby residents began to surface about hearing moans coming from within the field where it is located. Investigation revealed that these moans were produced by subjects who had fallen into <i>SCP-9717</i> during its active phase; however, these subjects showed no physical signs that they had been affected by anything other than their own volition (see Addendum 9716). The Foundation was alerted to this phenomenon when an investigation team sent to interview witnesses found several individuals who appeared to have been affected by some form of anomalous compulsion (see Interview Log 9716). The team discovered <i>SCP-9717</i> shortly after finding several individuals in various states of undress lying around its edge; all individuals were taken into custody for questioning and amnesticized before being released back into society without incident (see Addendum 9716).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9717.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 9717.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br><h3>Addendum 9717.3 : </h3>Experiment Log :<br><br>Experiment 9717-3:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9717, a 31 year old female. Subject has been selected for this experiment due to her status as a non-anomalous human being.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9717 is instructed to enter <i>SCP-9717</i> and experience its effects firsthand. After she does so, D-9717 is instructed to describe the sensations she feels while in <i>SCP-9717</i>'s proximity, and then again when entering it completely. The resulting data will be used in future experiments involving other subjects.</div>
