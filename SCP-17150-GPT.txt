It has two arms and two legs, each ending in claws. Its eyes are yellow and its mouth contains sharp teeth.<br><br><i>SCP-17150</i>'s primary anomaly is that it can create an eternal flame from any type of candle within its vicinity, regardless of size or shape. The flame created by <i>SCP-17150</i> will never extinguish unless it is directly extinguished by the entity itself or removed from the area where it was created.<br><br>In addition to this ability, <i>SCP-17150</i> also displays protective behavior towards any candle(s) within its vicinity; if anyone attempts to damage or move the candle(s), <i>SCP-17150</i> will become hostile and attack them until they cease their action or leave the area entirely. Any physical contact with <i>SCP-17150</i> causes severe burns that cannot be healed using conventional means; only complete removal of all affected tissue can stop further damage from occurring.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17150</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a single candle, which <i>SCP-17150</i> will use to create its flame. Any personnel entering the containment area must wear protective clothing and gloves to prevent physical contact with <i>SCP-17150</i>.<br><br>In order to prevent accidental activation of <i>SCP-17150</i>'s anomalous properties, no other candles or open flames are allowed within the containment area. If any additional candles are brought into the containment area for testing purposes, they must be extinguished before leaving the room.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17150.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred at Site-██. During the breach, <i>SCP-17150</i> was seen protecting a candle from being extinguished by Foundation personnel. After several attempts to contain the entity, it eventually escaped containment and has not been seen since.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17150.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17150</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17150</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17150</i>. Can you tell me why you protect the candle?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17150</i>:</b> It is my duty to protect the flame of life and hope that it brings. Without it, all would be lost in darkness and despair.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17150.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-9042, a Class-D personnel.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> D-9042 was instructed to approach <i>SCP-17150</i> and attempt to move the candle it is protecting.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Upon attempting to move the candle, <i>SCP-17150</i> immediately attacked D-9042 with its claws, causing severe burns on both arms and face. The subject was immediately removed from the containment area and treated for his injuries.</div>
