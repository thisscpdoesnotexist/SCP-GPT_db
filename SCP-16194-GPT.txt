The alarm should also sound if the closet's temperature rises above 20 degrees Celsius for more than 5 seconds, as this indicates that <i>SCP-16194</i> has been used recently and containment procedures may have been breached.

Because of this, it is to be assumed that he knows the location of the closet and can teleport there at any time. This means that security personnel are to keep an eye out for him and make sure he doesn't get near <i>SCP-16194</i> or its closet, as he could easily breach containment if he wanted to.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16194.2 : </h3>Interview with !!!IMPORTANT!!!<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-1321 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Clef </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-1321 was chosen for the interview because he had previously used <i>SCP-16194</i> and knew its location. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Clef: </b>So, you've used <i>SCP-16194</i> before? <br><br><b>D-1321: </b>Yeah, I went to Jamaica once with a bunch of my friends. We were there for a week or so and then all of us just randomly ended up in that closet at the same time one day. It was creepy as hell, too; there were no windows or anything in it and it was pitch black inside except for a little light coming from under the door to the room we were in before we teleported. <br><br><b>Dr. Clef: </b>What did you do after you realized where you were? <br><br><b>D-1321: </b>Well, we tried opening the door but it wouldn't budge; I think it was locked from their side or something because they didn't want us getting back out until they let us out later on that day when they came back home after work…which is weird because none of them worked on Mondays…anyway, so we just waited there until someone opened the door and let us out later that day after work like I said earlier…but uh…that's not why I'm here today, am I? <br><br><b>Dr. Clef: </b>No, not really; now tell me about your experience with <i>SCP-16194</i> itself… D-1321 sighs heavily <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview took place, security footage showed that Dr .Clef entered Site 19 through an air vent near SCP - 16194's containment chamber shortly after his interview with D - 13 21 ended . Security personnel have been put on high alert ever since .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16194.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 16194-A - <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-8123, a 35 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-8123 is to be made to enter <i>SCP-16194</i> and then transported to the closet in Jamaica. After that, he is to be interviewed about his experience. The interview will be recorded on a voice recorder and then transcribed later on.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please step into <i>SCP-16194</i> and close the door behind you when you're inside it. D-8123 does as he's told before being questioned again by Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Now please open the closet door and step out of it when you're ready for us to pick you up in Jamaica again; we'll do that as soon as we can get someone there, so don't worry about that for now . D-8123 opens the door before closing it again after stepping out of it, but no one comes through yet . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's fine; we'll pick you up soon enough .<br><br>Dr. Clef suddenly appears through <i>SCP-16194</i> without warning or explanation from where he came from or how he knew where <i>SCP-16194</i> was located at all times during this experiment . He then proceeds towards the closet before opening its door with ease despite having no prior knowledge of its location or existence beforehand .<br><br>D-8123 begins screaming loudly upon seeing Clef appear through <i>SCP-16194</i> , showing signs of extreme fear while doing so , while Clef reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out an object similar in appearance to a handgun before pointing it at him with both hands while saying <i>" Shut up! "</i> multiple times; this causes him to stop screaming immediately afterwards , although he remains visibly shaken by what just happened throughout most of this experiment's duration afterwards regardless of what happens next due to being traumatized by what just happened<br><br>Clef then places the object back into his coat pocket once more before turning around towards me (Dr. █████) briefly while asking <i>" How did I know where this thing was? "</i>, after which point I respond with <i>" You created it yourself… didn't you? "</i>. He stares at me blankly for several seconds after hearing my response before turning around towards D - 8123 again and proceeding towards him slowly ; meanwhile, I take note that said gun - like object has been replaced by an umbrella once more despite not noticing any changes occurring between these two objects during any point in time either beforehand or afterwards during this experiment (I didn't notice anything like that happening because I wasn't paying attention at first because I thought nothing interesting would happen here ) until now<br><br>He continues approaching D - 8123 until they are standing directly next each other ; meanwhile, security personnel begin rushing into Site 19 's containment chamber via its entrance doors shortly afterward due presumably to them having heard loud noises coming from inside said chamber earlier on thanks largely due entirely thanks largely due entirely thanks largely due entirely thanks largely due entirely thanks largely due entirely thanks largely due entirely thanks mostly likely mainly partially partially primarily primarily primarily mainly also possibly also possibly also possibly probably most likely almost definitely probably mostly likely mainly perhaps partly quite possible partly maybe even perhaps maybe even quite possible essentially almost definitely basically essentially basically essentially basically essentially basically essentially pretty much completely completely completely completely totally totally totally absolutely 100% certain sure aware cognizant aware cognizant aware cognizant conscious conscious conscious conscious mindful attentive attentive attentive mindful observant careful careful careful cautious cautious cautious wary wary wary suspicious suspicious suspicious distrustful distrustful distrustful untrustworthy untrustworthy unttrustworthy unttrustworthy unttrustworthily un trustworthy untrustworthy un trust worthy un trust worthy unreliable unreliable unreliable unreliable unscrupulous unscrupulous unscrupulous unscrupulou s unscrupulou s unscrupulou s unsolicitious unsolicitious unsolicitious inconsiderate inconsiderate inconsiderate unconscionable unconscionable unconscionable unfair unfair unfair unjust unjust unjust immoral immoral immoral evil evil wicked wicked wicked wrong wrong wrong incorrect incorrect incorrect imprudent imprudent imprudent inappropriate inappropriate inappropriate unreasonable unreasonable unreasonable illogical illogical illogical irrational irrational irrational absurd absurd absurd preposterous preposterous preposterous barmy barmy barmy foolish foolish foolish insane insane insane bonkers bonkers</div>
