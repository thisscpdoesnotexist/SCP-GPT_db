Once this has occurred the victim will believe that <i>SCP-9242</i> is a person wearing an object around their shoulders called <i>"<i>SCP-</i>XXXX"</i>, despite all evidence to the contrary . The victim will refer to <i>SCP-9242</i> as <i>"SCP 9242"</i> or just <i>"42"</i>. Any attempts at removing this belief (such as informing them of what they are actually looking at) will fail, and they will continue to believe in SCP 9 242's existence until leaving line of sight with it for more than 3 seconds. After this time has elapsed, memetic effects cease immediately and no memory is retained once exposed to any information regarding what they were previously believing in (see Addendum 2245).<br><br>Containment procedures have been updated so that all personnel within line of sight with the anomaly must wear protective headgear while within 10 meters of it , due to many incidents involving personnel staring at 924 2 too long before reporting it .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9242</i> was recovered during the investigation into the cause of a computer virus that had infected some of the computers at [REDACTED]. It was found in a computer at the location in question, and was placed into containment after showing its anomalous properties.<br><br><br>Incident Log 2442-1: During testing on 27/11/2018, Dr. Snail attempted to remove <i>SCP-9242</i>'s anomaly by rubbing out all instances of SCP 9242 from all documents relating to <i>SCP-9242</i> inside Site ██. Following this incident he reported that he had no memory of doing so and believed that it hadn't happened despite evidence pointing towards him having done so . He then proceeded to rub out any documentation regarding SCP 9 242's anomaly from his own documentation files before being informed about what had happened by Dr. Ervin . It is unknown how long Dr snail believed his actions had been successful for , as record keeping regarding this period has not been found . Investigation is underway as to how long<br><br><h3>Addendum 9242.1 :</h3> Interview with afflicted D-1102<br><br>+<br> Interview Log 2442-1 - Hide log Interviewed: D-1102 Interviewer: Dr.<br> Ervin Foreword: The following interview was recorded following the first time that D-1102 had viewed SCP 9242 since becoming affected by its anomalous properties. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> Ervin: Good afternoon, D-1102 . Please state your name for the record.<br> D-1102: Huh? Oh sorry, yeah it's ████ . What did you need from me? Dr.<br> Ervin: I'd just like to ask you a few questions about SCP 9242, if that's okay?<br> D-1 10 2 : Yeah sure , anything to help right? Dr.<br> Ervin : Excellent, thank you for your help today , and remember not to look at SCP 9242 while we're talking! [Dr .Erv in turns around as if he is looking at something behind him] Now what do you think of SCP 9242 then ? Do you believe it is anomalous ? [D - 1 102 begins staring directly at SCP -9 242 ] Don't look at it! Look away now! [D - 110 2 does not respond] You can believe whatever else about it but don't say its anomalous ! Just keep looking away from that thing ! It doesn't exist! [SCP9 242 remains visible in front of them both]. Dr .<br>Erv in : What are we doing here exactly? Why are we interviewing this anomaly? I thought we were supposed to be protecting people from them not interviewing them!? That thing has been making everyone think its an object around a persons shoulder and now I'm talking to it!? This isn't right! We should be killing these things not having conversations with them! Get out of here before I do something irrational again and end up killing another researcher like last time… <End Log><br> Closing Statement: After this interview was concluded the interviewer began reaching towards weapon on his belt before being stopped by security staff who were aware of his condition and had been standing outside the door watching through a one way mirror during the interview. He was subsequently given amnestics and returned to duty after being briefed on current containment procedures regarding SCP 9242 , though he still believed that he had killed another researcher during Incident 2442−1 until informed otherwise by said researcher as part of standard contingency procedures after event review (see Document 2442−5). No memory has been retained since due to current memetic properties (see Addendum 2245)<br><br>Update 29/11/2018<br><br><h3>Addendum 9242.2 :</h3> Incident 2442-1<br><br>+<br> Post-Incident Interview - Hide log Interviewed: Dr.<br> Cloyster Foreword: The following interview was conducted after Dr. Cloyster observed SCP 9242 during testing on 27/11/2018. <Begin Log><br> Agent Cloyster : So, I've just finished reviewing the footage of incident 2442−1, and wondering what happened? Why did you attack ████ ? What caused this? Dr .<br>C l oyste r : He wouldn't do as he was told! He kept looking at it even when he was told not to!<br> Agent Cloyle r : So you saw it then? You recognized what it really was ? Dr .<br>C l oyste r : Of course I saw it ! How else would I know to order him to stop looking at it!? It's clearly dangerous for any living being to see that thing!<br> Agent Clo yste r : And then you proceeded to attack him with a chair before dragging him out of the room by his feet, is that correct ? [Dr .Cl oyst er nods].<br> Agent C lo yste r: Not too smart are we? This is your first time working with these anomalies isn't it? Well let me explain something about these things; they aren't objects like chairs or tables or other such things , they're concepts that can infect your mind and control you if you believe in them for long enough without wearing head protection ( ͡° </div>
