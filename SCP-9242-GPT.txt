The locker door is to remain closed at all times when not being tested with, and no personnel are allowed to enter without O5 approval. Only D-class personnel with written consent from the overseer of Site-██ may be used for testing, as it has been proven that most non-D class individuals cannot handle <i>SCP-</i>[9242]-1 which will cause them fatal injuries if exposed for too long.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9242</i> is a book with an unknown title located in a locker at Site-██. When the locker door is opened, <i>SCP-</i>[9242]-1 will emerge from inside and begin to fly towards the nearest human being or animal. At this point, <i>SCP-</i>[9242]-1 will cover the subject's ears with it's wings then proceed to recite one of it's codes. After several seconds of reciting, [DATA EXPUNGED] and then die at an average time of ██ minutes (See Addendum 9242-2). All subjects exposed to <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 have died; however, there are documented cases where subjects were not killed by exposure but instead collapsed in a catatonic state and are still alive today (see Addendum 9242-3).<br><br><i>SCP-</i>[942]<br>-1 takes on different forms depending on who the victim is: if exposed to D class personnel, it will appear as a small bird like creature <i>"D█████"</i>. If exposed to senior staff members, it appears as <i>"███████ ███"</i>, who was previously assigned as overseer for Site-██ before being terminated in 2005 due to repeated insubordination after claiming that he was <i>"going mad"</i> . However if exposed to any other living organism than human or animal - such as plants - [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 was recovered after ██ deaths were reported at Site-██. Agents were sent to investigate the cause, and upon entering the locker containing <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1, a D class personnel was found dead inside with [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br>Note from Dr.<br> █████: I don't know why we haven't destroyed this thing already, it's just wasting space in our storage facility . We should just get rid of it and lock it up in our incinerator or something. -Dr. ████<br><br><h3>Addendum 9242.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 Test Log<br><br><br>Test #: 1-A<br><br><br>Subject: D-73961, a 38 year old Caucasian male.<br> Results: <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 appeared as a small bird like creature, resembling a sparrow. The subject immediately entered an epileptic state and was extracted from the testing chamber after 15 minutes of exposure by security officers. Subject expired shortly after being removed from the chamber due to brain damage caused by [DATA EXPUNGED].<br> Notes: <i>"This is where we got the idea for using D class personnel for our tests."</i> - Dr.<br> ████ Test #: 1-B Subject: Dr ████, Site Director at Site-██ ,<br> age 58 Results: <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 appeared as <i>"███████ ███"</i> , former overseer of Site-██ who had been terminated several years earlier due to repeated insubordination claiming that he was <i>"going mad"</i>. The subject began to scream shortly after exposure before collapsing on the floor and ceasing all vital signs . No autopsy was performed on his body as per request of his family; however, it is believed that [DATA EXPUNGED] resulted in his death based on previous test logs involving organic material (see Addendum 9242.3).<br> Notes : As far as I'm concerned this thing can go straight into incineration just like what happened with poor old █████ . It's only causing more harm than good here!<br> -Dr █████ Test #2 Subject : Dr [REDACTED]<br> Results : <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 took form of a small white dog with bandages wrapped around it's head and body while attached to an IV drip next to it laid what looked like an unidentified human fetus which did not move or make any noise throughout the entire test period (See Addendum 9242.[REDACTED]). Exposure lasted for 30 minutes resulting in both subjects dying simultaneously following countless attempts to remove them from their containment chambers by security staff members who were unable to open their doors leading many people working at site during that time period believing they were under attack by some unknown entity until O5 clearance could arrive at site and have them open up those storage chambers resulting in discovery of both subjects' bodies which could be seen emitting smoke through cracks near hinges which quickly dissipated when opened up allowing access inside revealing two corpses burned beyond recognition displaying no external signs life other than remaining limbs still moving around slightly suggesting movement was involuntary.<br> Notes : At first I thought these things were going insane but then I found out about this other researcher who kept screaming about how he wanted these things dead but couldn't explain why so I think now we know why . These things are just too dangerous! -Dr.[REDACTED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 9242.2 :</h3> ██ Fatalities Attributed to <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1<br><br><br>Date of Death: ██/██/████.<br> Victim: Dr. ███, a 48 year old Caucasian male.<br> Cause of Death: Unknown; body was discovered in the Site-██ cafeteria and subsequent investigation revealed no cause of death or any evidence that could help explain it's death (See Addendum 9242.[REDACTED]).<br> Date of Death: ██/██/<br>████ Victim: D-class personnel 056,<br> a 19 year old Asian Female Cause of Death : Suspected cardiac arrest; body was discovered in D class personnel quarters after an alarm went off indicating someone had died within the cell block which is standard protocol for all SCPs kept on site . Autopsy report determined that she died from sudden cardiac arrest and acute heart failure with no signs pointing towards foul play (See Addendum 9242.[REDACTED]).<br> Date of Death : ██/██/<br>████ Victim : Dr [REDACTED] ,<br> Site Director at Site-██ Age 30 years old Cause Of Death : Suicide Notes -Dr [REDACTED] had been acting strangely ever since he saw <i>SCP-</i>[942]-1 during testing stating that <i>"It keep asking me to expose myself to it."</i> before vanishing from his room one night resulting in him having his security clearance revoked by order from O5 council resulting in further investigation being conducted into his claims only for them to be found true after several dead bodies were discovered wrapped up inside plastic sheets throughout the site each with</div>
