The penguins are capable of moving at speeds far exceeding those of normal avian locomotion, and have displayed an unnatural level of aggression towards Mr. Fischbach, even when he has not provoked them in any way.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-24963</i> remains unknown; however, it appears to be linked to a video uploaded to Mr. Fischbach's channel on October 26th, 2018 entitled <i>"Markiplier vs Penguins"</i>. In the video, Mr. Fischbach can be seen attempting to evade a group of angry penguins while being chased through various locations around Los Angeles. Since that time, reports from witnesses have indicated that the pursuit has continued on multiple occasions throughout California and other parts of the United States as well as internationally in countries such as Japan and Australia.<br><br>Attempts by Foundation personnel to apprehend or contain <i>SCP-24963</i> have been unsuccessful thus far due to its unpredictable nature; furthermore, due to its association with Mr. Fischbach's celebrity status there is significant risk associated with attempting more direct intervention into this phenomenon without proper authorization from higher command levels within the Foundation hierarchy due to potential public relations issues should details about this incident become known outside Foundation channels.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-24963</i>, containment is not possible at this time. Foundation personnel are to monitor Mr. Fischbach's social media accounts and other public appearances for any signs of <i>SCP-24963</i> activity and report it to the appropriate personnel immediately. In addition, all sightings of <i>SCP-24963</i> should be reported to the nearest Foundation facility in order to facilitate further investigation into this phenomenon.<br><br>In the event that Mr. Fischbach is located by <i>SCP-24963</i>, Mobile Task Force Omega-6 (<i>"Penguin Chasers"</i>) are authorized to intervene in order to protect him from harm or capture any penguins involved in the pursuit if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24963.1: </h3> On February 15th, 2019, Mobile Task Force Omega-6 (<i>"Penguin Chasers"</i>) was formed in response to the growing threat posed by <i>SCP-24963</i>. The task force is currently tasked with tracking and containing any instances of <i>SCP-24963</i> that may arise in the future.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24963.2: </h3> Interview with Markiplier<br><br>On October 28th, 2018, Mr. Fischbach was interviewed by Foundation personnel in order to gain more information about <i>SCP-24963</i>. During the interview, he stated that he had no idea why the penguins were chasing him and that it had been going on for several months prior to the video being uploaded. He also mentioned that they seemed to be able to anticipate his movements and would often appear out of nowhere in order to continue their pursuit. When asked if there was anything else he could tell us about them, Mr. Fischbach replied: <i>"They're really fastâ€¦and they seem really angry."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 24963.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On February 28th, 2019, Mobile Task Force Omega-6 (<i>"Penguin Chasers"</i>) was dispatched to investigate a reported sighting of <i>SCP-24963</i> in the city of Tokyo, Japan. Upon arrival at the location, the team observed Mr. Fischbach being pursued by approximately twenty penguins on foot and via motorized vehicles. The team then attempted to intervene in order to protect Mr. Fischbach from harm; however, all attempts were unsuccessful due to the speed and agility displayed by <i>SCP-24963</i>'s pursuers as well as their apparent lack of fear towards Foundation personnel. After approximately thirty minutes of pursuit through various locations around Tokyo, Mr. Fischbach managed to evade his pursuers and return safely back home without incident or injury.</div>
