It possesses the appearance of a young Korean female with long hair and the ability to generate black smoke from its body. <i>SCP-14980</i>'s abilities are triggered by music, which it absorbs through its skin, and will cause it to enter an active state when exposed to various forms of music.<br><br>During this active state, <i>SCP-14980</i> will begin to emit large amounts of smoke from its body and begin dancing in a manner similar to that observed in K-pop idols during their performances. The amount of smoke emitted from <i>SCP-14980</i> increases with time until it reaches approximately 5 meters in height . While emitting this smoke, <i>SCP-14980</i> will also begin producing musical sounds at varying pitches through unknown means. These sounds are often distorted or garbled but have been shown to be similar or identical to those produced by popular K-pop idols such as Girls' Generation , EXO , BTS , Red Velvet , Twice , and Black Pink .<br><br><i>SCP-14980</i> has shown no hostile intent towards any personnel but has proven difficult for researchers due to its unpredictable behavior when entering an active state; instances have been known not only move around unpredictably while emitting large amounts of smoke but also change poses frequently and rapidly as if attempting mimicry . When not being stimulated by music, however, instances have shown no anomalous properties nor any signs of sapience . Instances appear unable communicate verbally except for making 'singing' noises similar in nature those produced by other K-pop idols; however they can be understood through lip reading (See Addendum 14980/1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 14980.1 : </h3>고마워!<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-14980</i> was found to be able to communicate verbally in Korean through the use of a voice synthesizer. It is unknown how <i>SCP-14980</i> acquired this device as no devices similar in nature have been found within its containment cell. The following is an interview conducted with <i>SCP-14980</i> after it was discovered that it could communicate verbally:<br><br><h3>Addendum 14980.2 : </h3>Interview with 고마워!<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14980</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to determine if <i>SCP-14980</i> is sapient and if it could be taught how to speak English. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Good morning, <i>SCP-14980</i>.
