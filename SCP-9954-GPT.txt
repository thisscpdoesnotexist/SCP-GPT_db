The walls of this facility are to be made of lead, and all personnel are required to wear a radiation suit at all times while inside the facility.<br><br><i>SCP-9954</i> is not allowed to leave the underground facility under any circumstances. If it attempts to do so, it must be immediately restrained by security personnel and returned back into its containment chamber; if <i>SCP-9954</i> resists these efforts, lethal force may be used against it (see Incident Log 9955-1).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9954</i> is a black hole with a radius of 0.08 meters located in the center of the universe. <i>SCP-9954</i> is capable of emitting light from its event horizon, which has been observed to be blue in color.<br><br><i>SCP-9954</i> was discovered by Dr. ██████ on ██/██/20██ when he was looking through a telescope at night and noticed that there appeared to be an additional star in the sky that wasn't there during the day. He reported this to his superiors, who sent him back out to confirm his findings; upon doing so, he was immediately reassigned and amnesticized due to his knowledge of <i>SCP-9954</i> being deemed too dangerous for anyone else to know about (see Addendum).<br><br>The Foundation has since constructed an underground facility around <i>SCP-9954</i>'s location and have begun research into it; however, all attempts at observing it directly have failed due to its small size (see Addendum). As such, all information about <i>SCP-9954</i> is currently based on observations made by recording devices placed within the underground facility itself; these recordings are then analyzed by computer programs designed specifically for this purpose before they are passed onto researchers for further analysis (see Experiment Log 9955).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9954.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ██████<br><br>The following interview was conducted on ██/██/20██ with Dr. █████████, who discovered <i>SCP-9954</i> in 20██. The interview was conducted by Agent █████, who had been assigned to interrogate him about his knowledge of <i>SCP-9954</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. █████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>Hello, doctor. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your discovery of <i>SCP-9954</i> in 20██; is that alright? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Yes, go ahead and ask me whatever you want. Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>Very well then… so where did you first notice the anomaly? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Well… one night I was looking through my telescope at the sky and noticed that there seemed to be an additional star in it that wasn't there during the day; I thought this was quite odd and decided to look into it further by taking some pictures of it with my camera phone later on when it wasn't visible from Earth's surface… but when I looked at them later on they didn't have anything unusual in them at all! So after thinking about this for a while, I came up with an idea as to what could've caused this strange phenomenon; as far as we know black holes are created when a large amount of matter is compressed into a single point by gravity until its density becomes infinite - which means that if such an object were placed inside our solar system, then from Earth's perspective we would only be able to see its gravitational effects rather than any physical characteristics due to how small they are! And since black holes don't emit any light themselves - or do they? That's what got me thinking… maybe there could be something emitting light from within the event horizon itself! So after doing some research into this subject matter myself - using information obtained from sources such as textbooks and online articles - along with making several calculations based on my own observations regarding its location , size , mass , speed etcetera (see Addendum 9954), I came up with what appeared to be an appropriate candidate for being the eye of our universe ; however, upon further analysis these calculations turned out not only inaccurate but also impossible given current scientific knowledge (see Addendum 9954) which led me back onto square one once again! However just before giving up completely on trying figure out what exactly was causing these strange phenomena , another idea occurred to me that would explain both their existence and behavior ; instead of being located within our universe itself like most people think is actually the case (see Addendum 9955), perhaps this <i>"eye"</i> isn't actually part of our universe at all but instead exists outside it ! And if so then perhaps everything else we've observed surrounding it may also exist outside our universe instead ! But even if true how can something exist outside space-time ? And more importantly why haven't we noticed anything else like them before now ? After all nothing should really be able reach us here right ? Well apparently something did reach us eventually because shortly after coming up with this hypothesis several other anomalies similar in nature began appearing around <i>SCP-9954</i> including [REDACTED] . Now keep in mind none of these were visible directly either but still managed somehow get here nonetheless . Perhaps whatever brought them here might've done so similarly too . Which brings us back onto why none have been detected prior ; maybe because their existence has always been confined within a certain area or plane or dimension or realm or reality beyond ours until recently ! Or maybe because nothing can escape from wherever they're coming from unless someone helps them do so ! Also keep in mind just because humans haven't seen anything like them before doesn't mean no one has though . Maybe whoever created those things found another way besides ours through which they could travel between realms without physically crossing over themselves while still keeping tabs on everything around us without anyone noticing their presence ; especially since most people wouldn't even believe such things existed anyway unless someone told them otherwise first ! Now considering how long ago humanity began observing astronomical objects using telescopes along with how many times those same objects have changed over time tells me whoever made those things must have had access not only technology far superior than ours today but also knowledge much greater than theirs too ! In fact considering how advanced their technology appears compared against ours today makes me wonder whether humans will ever become capable enough someday ourselves build stuff like theirs someday too … assuming we survive long enough for that kind of<br><br><h3>Addendum 9954.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 9955-1:<br><br>The following is a transcript of the first experiment performed on <i>SCP-9954</i>.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-9954</i>.

[<i>SCP-9954</i> begins screaming loudly for several minutes before abruptly stopping.] Uh… Sorry about that, but uh… What was the question again? Sorry about that; it's just that uh…. You know how sometimes when people get really upset they kinda black out and forget what they were doing or saying or whatever for a while before coming back to their senses again and remembering everything they did while in this state of mind or whatever it was called like ten minutes ago by someone who wasn't even here at the time because he left ten minutes ago to go get some coffee from the break room which is located on level 2 of this facility which is currently under construction because we're running out of space down here in order to store all these things we've collected over time including all those things we've collected over time including all those things we've collected over time including all those things we've collected over time including all those things we've collected over time including all those things we've collected over tim [Dr. ██████ signals security personnel inside the room to restrain <i>SCP-9954</i>.] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Thank you very much for your cooperation today, <i>SCP-9</i> 9 5 4 .
