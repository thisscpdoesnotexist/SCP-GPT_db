This includes but is not limited to: luck manipulation, influencing outcomes of events and altering the behavior of those around it through subtle means such as body language or vocal inflection. <br><br><i>SCP-21107</i> appears to have no knowledge or control over this ability; instead it appears to be subconsciously activated whenever it desires something that would otherwise be impossible for a human being without anomalous intervention. It has been observed that this effect can become more pronounced when <i>SCP-21107</i> is in stressful situations or under pressure from others. <br><br>It should be noted that while <i>SCP-21107</i>'s effects are usually beneficial for itself they can sometimes have unintended consequences on those around it; often leading them into dangerous situations they would not normally encounter due to their own lack of luck or coincidence manipulation capabilities. <br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21107</i> is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. It is to be monitored by security personnel at all times and provided with basic amenities such as food, water and recreational activities. <br><br>In order to prevent any potential misuse of its anomalous abilities, <i>SCP-21107</i> must not be allowed access to any form of media or communication devices. Any attempts by personnel or other entities to interact with <i>SCP-21107</i> must first receive approval from the site director. <br><br>Any attempts by <i>SCP-21107</i> to use its anomalous abilities outside of the confines of its containment cell must immediately be reported and dealt with accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21107.1: </h3> <br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-21107</i> was encountered by Foundation personnel in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, California. It had been living in a small apartment and appeared to be unaware of its anomalous abilities. After initial containment it was transferred to Site-██ for further study and containment procedures were established as outlined above.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21107.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21107</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21107</i> <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████ <br>&ltBegin Log&gt <br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> Good morning, Mr. Reeves. I'm here to ask you a few questions about your anomalous abilities and how they affect you and those around you. Can you tell me what it feels like when these abilities are activated? <br><b><i>SCP-21107</i>:</b> It's hard to explain…it's like everything just falls into place for me in ways that I can't control or understand. It's almost as if luck is on my side no matter what I do or where I am, even if it doesn't make any sense at the time. <br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> Interesting…and do you ever feel any negative effects from these abilities? <br><b><i>SCP-21107</i>:</b> Not really, no. I mean, sometimes I get a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of luck and coincidence that seems to be around me all the time but other than that it's mostly positive. <br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> Alright then, thank you for your time Mr. Reeves. That will be all for now. <br>&ltEnd Log&gt <br><b>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-21107</i> was cooperative throughout the interview and no further anomalous activity was observed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21107.3: </h3> Experiment Logs <br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> <i>SCP-21107</i> was placed in a room with two other personnel and instructed to perform a simple task. The results showed that the task was completed successfully despite the odds being heavily stacked against them; indicating that <i>SCP-21107</i> had used its abilities to manipulate the situation in its favor. <br><b><br>Experiment 2:</b> <i>SCP-21107</i> was placed in a room with two other personnel and instructed to perform an impossible task. Despite this, it managed to complete the task successfully, again demonstrating its ability to manipulate probability in its favor. <br><b><br>Experiment 3:</b> <i>SCP-21107</i> was placed in a room with four other personnel and instructed to perform an extremely difficult task. It managed to complete the task without any outside assistance, further confirming its ability of luck manipulation.</div>
