It has been observed attempting various activities such as playing music (badly), writing poetry (poorly), cooking food (inedibly) etc., all in an effort to win over its hosts' affections. All attempts at this have failed thus far due to the aforementioned reasons.<br><br><i>SCP-17752</i> is highly contagious; any contact with the tumor can cause it spread rapidly throughout the body within hours, creating new tumors wherever it goes. Due to this property, containment procedures for <i>SCP-17752</i> must be strictly enforced at all times; no personnel are allowed direct contact with the object without proper protective gear such as hazmat suits or full body containment units being worn at all times during interaction/handling procedures. In addition, any personnel who come into contact with <i>SCP-17752</i> must undergo immediate medical examination afterwards for signs of infection before being cleared for duty again<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17752</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a full body containment unit and hazmat suits for personnel who come into contact with the object.<br><br>Personnel handling <i>SCP-17752</i> must wear protective gear at all times and undergo medical examination afterwards for signs of infection before being cleared for duty again. No personnel are allowed direct contact with the object without proper protective gear being worn.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of <i>SCP-17752</i>, any personnel who have been exposed to it must immediately report their exposure to the site's medical staff so that they can receive appropriate treatment as soon as possible.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17752.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17752</i> made a plea to its current host to be allowed to remain with them. The request was denied and the tumor was removed from the host's body and placed back into containment. Since then, <i>SCP-17752</i> has ceased all attempts at befriending its hosts and instead spends most of its time in isolation, seemingly resigned to its fate.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17752.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17752</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-17752</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> This interview was conducted in order to gain a better understanding of <i>SCP-17752</i>'s motivations and behaviour.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17752</i>. Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17752</i>:</b> Yes, I can hear you. What do you want to know?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Why do you try to befriend your hosts?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17752</i>:</b> Because I want to be accepted and loved, just like everyone else. I know it's impossible for me to be truly accepted due to my nature, but I still want someone to care about me and accept me for who I am.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you ever get frustrated when your attempts at friendship fail?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17752</i>:</b> Yes, of course. It's hard to keep trying when I know it won't work out in the end. But I still try, because maybe one day someone will accept me for who I am and love me despite my flaws.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-17752</i> was then returned to its containment chamber.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17752.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17752.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the extent of <i>SCP-17752</i>'s sapience and sentience. An adult human subject was placed in the containment chamber with <i>SCP-17752</i> and instructed to interact with it for an hour.<br><b><br>Results:</b> The subject reported that <i>SCP-17752</i> had attempted to engage them in conversation multiple times throughout the experiment, though its attempts were largely unsuccessful due to its poor communication skills and limited understanding of human language. However, when prompted by the subject, <i>SCP-17752</i> was able to display a basic understanding of certain concepts such as friendship and loyalty, as well as expressing what appeared to be genuine emotion when rejected by its host.</div>
