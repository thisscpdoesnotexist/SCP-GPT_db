These beetles are capable of producing an anomalous form of energy, dubbed <i>"singularity energy"</i>, which has been observed to cause drastic changes in nearby matter and space-time.<br><br>When exposed to this energy, objects within a certain radius will become distorted or transformed into new forms. In addition, individuals affected by this phenomenon have been known to experience extreme mental and physical changes as well as time anomalies. The exact effects vary depending on the intensity and duration of exposure.<br><br>The source of <i>SCP-21265</i> appears to be related to a singularity point located at [REDACTED], though attempts at locating or accessing it have so far proven unsuccessful.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-21265</i>, containment is considered impossible. Instead, Foundation personnel are to monitor all known instances of this phenomenon and take appropriate action when necessary. Any individuals affected by <i>SCP-21265</i> should be taken into custody for further study and observation.<br><br>In addition, research teams are to investigate possible methods of containing or neutralizing the effects of <i>SCP-21265</i> in order to prevent any further incidents from occurring.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21265.1: </h3> Notable Incidents<br><br>• On ██/██/20██, a large swarm of Rhinoceros beetles appeared in Desolation Row, England. After several hours of exposure to the singularity energy, the entire town was transformed into a surreal landscape filled with strange creatures and structures. The only survivors were two members of an investigative team sent by the Foundation.<br><br>• On ██/██/20██, a similar incident occurred in Fig Tart, France. The resulting transformation was more extreme than that seen in Desolation Row; many buildings and objects were completely destroyed while others became twisted and distorted beyond recognition. Again, only two survivors were recovered from this incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21265.2: </h3> Interview with D-21265-1<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> D-21265-1<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Please describe your experience with <i>SCP-21265</i>.<br><b><br>D-21265-1:</b> It was like I was in some kind of dream or something… I felt like my body and mind were being pulled in different directions all at once, and then suddenly everything just stopped. That's when the beetles started appearing out of nowhere, and the energy they gave off was like nothing I had ever felt before. It felt like my entire world had changed in an instant, but it also seemed so familiar somehow… like I had been here before.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Do you remember anything else?<br><b><br>D-21265-1:</b> Yeah, I remember seeing a figure in the distance… it was like an angel or something, and it seemed to be guiding me somewhere. Then I ended up in this place called Desolation Row, where everything was so still and quiet. After that, I found myself at this point called the Singularity Point… that's when I woke up back here.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21265.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21265-A:</b> On ██/██/20██, a group of D-Class personnel were exposed to <i>SCP-21265</i> in an attempt to determine its effects. All subjects reported feeling disoriented and confused, and several experienced physical changes such as the growth of horns or wings. One subject also reported experiencing visions of various locations around the world that they had never visited before. After approximately two hours, all subjects returned to normal with no lasting effects.</div>
