<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-20986 is  the beach that makes you old</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20986<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20986</i> is a beach located on an island in the Mediterranean Sea. The beach appears to be composed of fine white sand and crystal clear waters.<br><br>When a human subject enters the area, they will experience accelerated aging at an alarming rate. Subjects will age rapidly, with physical changes such as wrinkles and gray hair appearing within minutes. After approximately one hour, subjects will reach their expected lifespan and die from natural causes associated with old age (e.g., heart failure).<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-20986</i> are not limited to humans; any living organism that enters the area will experience similar accelerated aging effects. Furthermore, any object brought into the vicinity of <i>SCP-20986</i> by a human subject has been observed to rapidly decay or decompose over time regardless of its composition or state prior to entering the area.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-20986</i> is to be contained within a 10 km radius exclusion zone, monitored by Foundation personnel. All vessels entering the area are to be inspected for any living organisms or objects that may have been exposed to <i>SCP-20986</i>. Any such items are to be confiscated and destroyed.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-20986</i> must wear protective gear at all times when in the vicinity of the beach, and no personnel are allowed within 50 meters of <i>SCP-20986</i> itself. Furthermore, no unauthorized vessels or aircrafts are permitted in the exclusion zone without prior authorization from Site Command.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20986.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation research vessel entered the exclusion zone surrounding <i>SCP-20986</i>. Upon approach to the beach, all personnel on board began rapidly aging and eventually perished. Autopsies revealed that their bodies had aged to an equivalent of ███ years old. All objects brought aboard the vessel were also found to have decayed beyond recognition.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20986.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Dr. ████████, Foundation researcher assigned to <i>SCP-20986</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell us what you know about <i>SCP-20986</i>? <br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Well, it's an anomalous beach located in the Mediterranean Sea that causes accelerated aging in any living organism that enters its vicinity, as well as rapid decomposition of any objects brought into the area by a human subject. We're still trying to determine exactly how this effect works and why it only affects certain areas of the beach and not others, but we do know that it is incredibly dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20986.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a D-Class personnel was instructed to enter <i>SCP-20986</i>. After approximately one hour, the subject expired due to old age. Autopsy results indicated that the subject had aged approximately sixty years in the time elapsed.</div>
