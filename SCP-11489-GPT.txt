It has been bought by the Foundation and its anomalous properties have been removed; it now functions as a regular store.

It sells everything at its best price and is called <i>"Comerciacizaciones xiang he S.C.P"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-11489</i> has the anomalous property of being able to sell items that do not exist in any reality, however they are still fully functional and have no anomalous properties whatsoever. They can be bought by anyone, but their prices vary depending on the buyer's wealth; this makes them useful for espionage purposes or as bribes to high ranked officials. <i>SCP-11489</i> also has an extensive catalog of products (see document 11489-A), all of which are available for purchase at any time, regardless of their availability in other stores or countries (see experiment log 11489). The manager of <i>SCP-11489</i> claims that it has always been like this since it was founded over 200 years ago; though he admits that some products were not available until recently due to <i>"lack of demand"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 11489.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████, the manager of <i>SCP-11489</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-11489</i> was bought by the Foundation and its anomalous properties removed. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, Mr… ██████? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Yes, that's me; I am the manager of this store since my father died last year and I took over his business. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What can you tell us about your store? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Well… it is a very normal store; we sell everything at its best price, but we don't have many customers because our prices are too low for most people here in Barcelona; they prefer to buy more expensive products from other stores even if they are not as good as ours or if they don't even exist in reality… what else can I say? It is just a normal shop like any other here in Barcelona… except that it has been around for 200 years now and it sells products that no one else does or can do because no one else has ever thought about them before! Dr. ██████ nods slowly while taking notes on his clipboard <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview confirmed our suspicions about <i>SCP-11489</i>'s anomalous properties being removed after purchase by the Foundation; however further testing on this matter will be required before any definite conclusions can be made .<br><br><h3>Addendum 11489.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Note: </b>The following experiments were conducted by Agent ██████, who was trained in electronics and computer engineering.<br><br>Experiment Log 11489-1:<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Agent ██████ entered the store and asked for a <i>"personal computer"</i> of the latest generation. The manager explained that they had them in stock, but they would not be available until the next day; he also mentioned that they could be bought at any time if Agent ██████ wanted to pay a higher price. Agent ██████ agreed to pay double the price, and waited outside while <i>SCP-11489</i> contacted their suppliers. After half an hour, another man entered the store and took away all of its products (including those not sold yet) with a van; he then returned with several boxes containing personal computers of different brands (see document 11489-A). After checking them all for functionality, Agent ██████ paid for one of them and left.<br><br><b>Result: </b>The product was fully functional despite being ordered from a nonexistent company; it also included software compatible with other computers from different brands. It is unknown how <i>SCP-11489</i> managed to do this without having contact with any other companies or people involved in electronics production or distribution. Further testing is required to determine whether this can be replicated outside <i>SCP-11489</i>'s limits.<br><br>Experiment Log 11489-2:<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Several documents describing different types of military equipment were given to <i>SCP-11489</i>'s manager along with fake credentials identifying him as an employee at [REDACTED] Defense Systems Inc., which produces weapons used by many countries around the world; these documents allowed him access to classified information about new models under development as well as their prices (which vary depending on their country of origin). He was then asked what kind of weapon he would like most if money were no object; after thinking about it for some time, he requested <i>"a laser gun that can shoot through walls"</i>. After receiving his payment (in cash), another man came into the store carrying two large boxes which contained several high power laser rifles made by [REDACTED] Defense Systems Inc.. They worked perfectly despite being ordered from an organization not affiliated with any government or military force known so far . All personnel involved in this experiment have been given Class A amnestics due to security reasons .</div>
