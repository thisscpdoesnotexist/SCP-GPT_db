Instead, Foundation personnel are to monitor paranormal activity during October and take appropriate measures when necessary. Additionally, any reports of mist or other anomalous phenomena associated with <i>SCP-17095</i> should be investigated and contained if possible.<br><br>Any personnel affected by <i>SCP-17095</i>’s effects are to be given psychological counseling as soon as possible in order to minimize the risk of long term psychological damage.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17095</i> is an anomalous entity that manifests itself in the form of a month, specifically October. <i>SCP-17095</i>'s effects become more pronounced as October progresses and culminate on Halloween night.<br><br>When <i>SCP-17095</i> is active, paranormal phenomena occur throughout the world at an increased rate. These phenomena include hauntings, poltergeist activity, reports of monsters, and other supernatural occurrences. Additionally, people affected by <i>SCP-17095</i> will experience heightened levels of fear and anxiety.<br><br>In addition to its paranormal effects, <i>SCP-17095</i> also has a physical presence in the form of a dark mist that appears during the month of October in various locations around the world. This mist has been observed to cause physical harm to any living creature it comes into contact with and can cause insanity if inhaled for too long or exposed to for too long period of time. The mist also seems to be attracted to areas where large numbers of people are gathered such as festivals or concerts; this phenomenon is believed to be caused by <i>SCP-17095</i> attempting to spread its influence further than it normally could on its own.<br><br>Finally, when Halloween night arrives all paranormal activity associated with <i>SCP-17095</i> stops abruptly until midnight passes and then resumes again at full strength until November 1st when it completely dissipates without trace or explanation until next year’s cycle begins anew .<br><br><h3>Addendum 17095.1 : </h3><br><br>On October 31st, 2018, Foundation personnel observed a large gathering of people in the center of ██████, England. These people were all dressed in costumes and appeared to be celebrating Halloween. As midnight approached, the crowd began to disperse with many members commenting on how they felt “lighter” or “happier”. This effect was later determined to be caused by <i>SCP-17095</i> dissipating its influence over the area as it always does when Halloween night ends.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17095.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-17095</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview was conducted in an attempt to gain more information about <i>SCP-17095</i>’s nature and motivations.<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-17095</i>.
