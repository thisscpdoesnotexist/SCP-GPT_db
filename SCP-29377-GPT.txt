    <h3>Item #: SCP-29377</h3>
<h4>"Colossal Benevolence"</h4>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Thaumiel</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-29377 is an immense marine organism resembling mythological sea serpents. The creature's size is difficult to estimate due to its ability to manipulate its visible length, but conservative measurements place its full length at approximately 600 kilometers. SCP-29377 has demonstrated sentience and sapience through complex communication with Foundation personnel via sonar signals.</p>
<p>The organism's body is covered in bioluminescent scales that are seemingly impervious to damage from conventional weaponry and exhibit extraordinary regenerative properties. SCP-29377 has shown an affinity for marine life, often acting as both protector of oceanic ecosystems and, curiously, a steward of balance, sometimes influencing local weather patterns to mitigate natural disasters. It has been theorized that SCP-29377 has existed for several millennia, as certain unexplained historical events now appear to correlate with its intervention.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to its size and benevolent disposition, SCP-29377 cannot be contained in the traditional sense. Instead, its existence is kept secret from the public and its movements are constantly monitored by satellites with stealth technology to avoid detection from non-Foundation observers. Any images or data captured by civilian utilities suggesting the presence of SCP-29377 are to be intercepted and doctored by embedded Foundation agents within various governmental and private organizations.</p>
<p>Foundation deep-sea outposts, disguised as research stations, are tasked with studying SCP-29377, maintaining communication, and safeguarding the organism from any potential threats. Direct interaction is forbidden except for authorized personnel equipped with specialized submarine vessels.</p>
<p>SCP-29377's benevolent temperament is not to be exploited for military or political purposes. Any attempts to harness SCP-29377 for such ends by any member of staff will result in immediate termination.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1:</h3>
<h4>"Discovery"</h4>
<p>SCP-29377 was first discovered when a missing Foundation submarine, investigating seismic activity in the Mariana Trench, unwittingly transmitted footage of a portion of the organism during a distress call. Foundation assets were immediately deployed to secure the area and conceal the event under the cover story of a deep-sea drilling accident.</p>
<h4>"Communication Efforts"</h4>
<p>Efforts to communicate with SCP-29377 met with success on ██/██/████, when Dr. Amelia Rose, a marine biologist and xenolinguist, established a rudimentary dialogue using a modified sonar device. SCP-29377 expressed an awareness of humanity and a desire to assist in preventing ecological catastrophes.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2:</h3>
<h4>"Experiment Log"</h4>
<p>Over several months, a series of coordinated efforts were made to understand and test the capabilities of SCP-29377, which the entity permitted after negotiations that assured its safety and autonomy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment 29377-A:</strong> SCP-29377 demonstrated the ability to alter water currents to redirect an approaching hurricane away from a populated coastline. The public impact was minimized by attributing the shift to unexpected meteorological phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment 29377-B:</strong> When presented with a simulated oil spill, SCP-29377 used an unknown mechanism to encapsulate and neutralize the oil, leaving the water unnaturally pure. Subsequent analysis of the water revealed traces of a complex organic compound not found in any known species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment 29377-C:</strong> SCP-29377 exhibited control over its bioluminescence to communicate through a range of colors and patterns, allowing for more nuanced dialogue with researchers. Through this, it revealed portions of its extensive historical knowledge, including references to lost civilizations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3:</h3>
<h4>"Incident Report 29377-01"</h4>
<p>On ██/██/████, a previously unknown hostile aquatic anomalous entity, classified as SCP-████, attacked Outpost Delta-7, situated at the edge of SCP-29377's known territory. SCP-29377 responded vigorously to the distress signals, intervening to protect the outpost and neutralize SCP-████. No fatalities were reported, and SCP-29377 sustained minor injuries that healed rapidly without intervention. A subsequent review of containment procedures for aquatic SCPs was mandated in light of SCP-29377's defensive actions.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4:</h3>
<h4>"Researcher Notes"</h4>
<p>SCP-29377's existence challenges our understanding of marine biology, mythology, and history. Its apparent goals align closely with several of the Foundation's own, particularly our mission to protect humanity from the threats posed by other SCPs. While it is classified as Thaumiel due to its usefulness in aiding our efforts, it should be noted that SCP-29377 maintains its agency and does not act under the Foundation's instruction. Its cooperation is a luxury that should not be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Dr. Amelia Rose's ongoing efforts to further our communication and understanding with SCP-29377 have not only provided invaluable insights into the entity but have also underscored the importance of diplomatic relationships with sentient anomalies. Continued observation and interaction may serve as the basis for a greater understanding of other Thaumiel-class SCPs.</p>
