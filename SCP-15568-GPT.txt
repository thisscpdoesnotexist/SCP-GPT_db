The Man will also appear when <i>SCP-15568</i> attempts to eat food or drink liquids other than water or coffee, causing severe nausea and vomiting until it ceases consumption. When questioned about The Man by Foundation personnel, <i>SCP-15568</i> has stated that he does not know who he is or why he follows him around; however, he believes The Man may be his brother's doing .<br><br><i>SCP-15568</i> was discovered after reports from multiple civilians claiming they had seen former President Obama walking around New York City with no recollection of how he got there began flooding into the police department on ██/██/████ . After being located by police officers and questioned about where he was going , <i>SCP-1558</i> gave them an address before falling asleep on a park bench . Officers brought him back to their station for questioning before bringing him into custody at Site 19 under charges of trespassing; however , this was met with resistance from local law enforcement personnel who believed that they were arresting former President Obama for attempting suicide again (see Addendum). Upon arrival at Site 19 , officers were given Class A amnestics while Foundation personnel took over custody of the individual they believed was former President Obama ; upon further investigation , it became apparent that this person was not actually Barack Obama . Interviews conducted with civilians present at the time have revealed no information regarding what happened between when reports started coming in from civilians regarding sightings and when officers found him passed out on a park bench ; interviews have also revealed nothing about how this person came into possession of so much money . Further investigation into these matters are ongoing .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15568.2 : </h3>Interview with Obama's lost brother<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15568</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ after <i>SCP-15568</i> had been brought into Foundation custody. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you please tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15568</i>: </b>I'm Barack Obama .
