<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15554</i> is  an hourglass that ticks down to major humanity affecting disasters</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15554</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15554</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Testing of <i>SCP-15554</i> requires Level 3 authorization, and may only be carried out with D-Class personnel.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15554</i> is an hourglass that has a sand timer of exactly one hour. The sand in the timer will not fall, and the time on the glass will not change. <i>SCP-15554</i>'s anomalous properties become apparent when viewed by any human being. When viewed by a human being, <i>SCP-15554</i>'s time will begin to tick down at an extremely accelerated pace, with each grain of sand falling approximately every second. Any human who views <i>SCP-15554</i> while it is ticking down will be unable to perceive anything other than <i>SCP-15554</i> for as long as they are viewing it.<br><br><i>SCP-15554</i> was discovered in ██████ High School in ██████, Kansas on ██/██/20██ after several students began showing symptoms of severe depression and suicidal thoughts over the course of several weeks following exposure to <i>SCP-15554</i>. All students exposed were interviewed and given class A amnestics without incident or complication. Class B amnestics were administered to all faculty members present at the school during this time period without incident or complication as well; however, no information regarding what caused these symptoms was recovered from any affected staff member due to their inability to recall anything other than their immediate surroundings during this time period due to exposure to <i>SCP-15555</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 15554.1 : </h3>████████ High School Incident<br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-15554</i> was brought to the attention of The Foundation by local authorities after a student at █████████ High School in ██████, Kansas was found dead in the school's parking lot. The student had been discovered by another student who had been exposed to <i>SCP-15554</i> and reported feeling an <i>"overwhelming sense of dread"</i> when they approached the body. When questioned about what they felt when approaching the body, this student reported that they felt as though something horrible would happen if they touched it or got too close. This prompted them to call 911 and report a suspicious death on campus. Upon arrival at the scene, police officers were unable to move closer than 10 meters from the body due to experiencing similar symptoms as those described by students exposed to <i>SCP-15554</i>; however, no anomalous properties were detected on or around the body at this time. After several minutes passed with officers being unable to approach any closer than 10 meters from the body due to these effects persisting despite no evidence of an active anomaly being present on or near it, one officer attempted touching it with his hand while wearing latex gloves in order test for any anomalous properties that may be present on or around it without making skin contact with it directly; however, upon doing so he immediately began experiencing similar symptoms as those experienced by other students and staff members who came into direct contact with <i>SCP-15554</i> during its discovery in 20██ . At this point all officers present retreated from their positions surrounding the corpse until approximately 50 meters away from where it lay before calling for backup units equipped with long range acoustic devices capable of dispersing crowds without causing permanent damage if used correctly (i.e., not directly pointed at anyone). Backup units arrived within 30 minutes and dispersed all civilians who had gathered around where police cars were parked using these devices before moving closer towards where police cars had previously surrounded [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 15554.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ████, High School Student <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ████, student at █████████ High School in ██████, Kansas. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent [REDACTED] </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted with ███ on the day after <i>SCP-15554</i> was brought to the attention of The Foundation by local authorities. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Could you please describe to me what happened yesterday? ███: Well I woke up and went to school like any other day. Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>And did anything unusual happen during your classes? ███: No not really. We had a test in my English class but that's about it. Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>And then what happened after school? ███: I went home like usual and hung out with some friends until dinner time then we ate and watched some TV for a while before going to bed around 11 o'clock or so I think it was…<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>That's fine, thank you for your time today sir. We have no further questions for you at this time but we may have more later if needed so don't leave town without letting us know first alright? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it became apparent that <i>SCP-15554</i> had not been contained by local authorities as originally assumed; however, due to its nature there were no signs of an active anomaly present on or near the body upon its discovery which is why police officers were unable to approach any closer than 10 meters from the corpse without experiencing symptoms similar those experienced by students exposed directly to <i>SCP-15554</i> during its discovery in 20██ .<br><br></div>
