Upon investigation, Foundation agents discovered that none of the victims had actually been harmed. After it was captured and contained on site , several interviews were conducted with it through Agent ███████<br> who spoke fluent Japanese . Below is a log of one such interview:<br><br>Interview Log 9015-3:<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> ████ ████<br><br><br>Interviewer: Agent ██████<br><br><br>Interviewed: <i>SCP-9015</i><br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9015.1 :</h3><br><br><i>SCP-9015</i>: I am a creature from another dimension! It is nice to meet you.<br><br>Agent ███████: It's nice to meet you too, <i>SCP-9015</i>. What can you tell me about yourself?<br><br><i>SCP-9015</i>: My name is SCP 9015 and I am a creature from another dimension! It is nice to meet you.<br><br>Agent ███████: Can we get back on topic please, 9015? We'll talk about your dimensional origins some other time. How did your species evolve to be what it is today? If that's not too much trouble… of course. [Agent ███████ gestures towards the bokken carried by SCP 9015.] That also came from this other dimension, right? Or are there trees in this universe that produce weapons when their leaves fall off in autumn or something like that? <SCP 9015 looks at his bokken> Oh my bad, was I talking during the movie before ? Sorry about that... So how did your species come up with the idea of creating these things in the first place ? They look pretty well made if I may say so myself . Those wood carvings look intricate enough for ancient Japan , but they don't really fit with what's commonly seen in our culture . Did someone just have an insane craving for sushi one day and start making them without knowing what he was doing ? [SCP falls silent] Uh… was there something else you wanted to say besides <i>"I am a creature from another dimension!"</i> … because it kind of seems like all you can say at this point... But let's just go with it for now . Ok ,<br> so let me ask again : how did your people come up with these swords ? Is there some sort of ritual involved or are they born out of thin air or what exactly ?? [Silence] You know , maybe I should leave this part out when telling my superiors about our conversation tonight… after all , *they* aren't very fond of jokes either . No need kicking down doors over someone making puns while working on his reports . (2 minutes pass while Agent ███████ drinks tea until he notices SCP has fallen asleep.) ( Agent gets startled) Oh shit ! You were sleeping before weren’t ya ?? Well… guess we’ll pick it up later then ! Hope everything turns out fine for ya, buddy ! Good night <3 (Screen goes blank).<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9015.2 :</h3><br><br><i>SCP-9015</i>: I am a creature from another dimension! It is nice to meet you.<br><br>Agent ███████: Hi, SCP 9015 ! How are ya doing ? [SCP falls silent] Hm… I guess it's still sleeping then ? You know , I'll just wait for it to wake up . So how about we talk about something else instead of waiting for this thing to wake up again ? [Guard enters the room and hands Agent ██████ a note.] Ah , thanks man ! This is perfect timing . What does it say ?? [Agent ██████ reads the note.] <i>"SCP 9015 has been moved into a containment chamber ."</i>? Weird . Let’s go check that out then ! (Both Agent and Guard leave the room.)</div>
