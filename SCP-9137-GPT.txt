People love this place.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9137</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Thaumiel<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> ~~~ See Addendum 9137-1 for details.<br><br>~~~ <i>SCP-9137</i> has already been contained. The warehouse's location is known only to the O5 Council, and no one else must know about it. Anyone who knows about <i>SCP-9137</i>, or enters it without permission, will be terminated immediately. If anyone somehow discovers the warehouse's exact location , they will be terminated immediately as well .<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9137</i> is a warehouse that appears randomly to anyone in an isolated area. It will disappear if anyone approaches it, and will reappear once the person leaves. This happens for every person who sees it, and there is no way to locate it unless you're in an isolated area .<br><br>There are currently 5 warehouses with this same effect, but <i>SCP-9137</i> is the only one where people love it. A few of our scientists have gone crazy trying to find out why this happens, so we won't let them near 9137 anymore .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9137</i> was discovered when a man was reported missing after his car crashed into a tree in the middle of nowhere. He had apparently been driving for a long time, and it is believed that he saw <i>SCP-9137</i> and ran into the tree while trying to get there.<br><br>The man was found dead in his car, but alive inside <i>SCP-9137</i>, where he had created several items from materials around the warehouse. These items were given to various people who loved them, and they became very popular .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9137.1 :</h3> Information on <i>SCP-9137</i><br><br>I've been working with <i>SCP-9137</i> for a while now, and I have discovered some interesting things about it .<br><br>1. It appears on Earth once every 50 years, but only to someone who is isolated from everyone else. A few minutes after it appears, it will disappear again.<br><br>2. If you enter the warehouse while it's there, you will not be able to see or hear anyone outside of the warehouse . This means that if anyone enters 9137 after a person notices it has appeared , they will not know that the person is there . This effect disappears when 9137 disappears, and can be reversed by going into an isolated area for a few hours .<br><br>3. A small hand written note can be found in 9137 which says <i>"Welcome to my warehouse! Please help yourself to anything you need!"</i> The handwriting matches no one we have ever seen before or since .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9137.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9137</i>'s contact log<br><br>A list of people who have experienced <i>SCP-9137</i> and later talked about it .<br><br><br>Date: 11/11/2018<br><br><br>Person: Jacob Jameson (37), an aspiring writer living in Los Angeles, CA.<br><br><br>Experience: Jacob was driving through the desert when he noticed a warehouse appear ahead of him. He got out of his car and walked up to it, which caused the building to disappear again after a few seconds. He said that this gave him inspiration for his next book , which was successful .</div>
