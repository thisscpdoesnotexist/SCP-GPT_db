<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19081 is  A kremlin troll farm that the lies of become reality</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19081<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19081</i> is a large, subterranean facility located in the Russian Federation. It is composed of several interconnected buildings and structures, including an administrative office building, a laboratory complex, and numerous living quarters for personnel.<br><br><i>SCP-19081</i>'s primary purpose appears to be the fabrication and dissemination of false information on various media platforms with the intent of influencing public opinion in favor of the government. The facility employs hundreds of individuals who are trained to create convincing false stories that are then spread across multiple outlets such as newspapers, radio stations, television broadcasts and social media accounts.<br><br>The facility also contains advanced computer systems capable of manipulating digital images and audio recordings to make them appear more realistic. Additionally, <i>SCP-19081</i> has access to sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms which allow it to accurately identify potential targets for its propaganda campaigns as well as track their responses.<br><br>Once fabricated stories have been disseminated by <i>SCP-19081</i> personnel they become partially or fully true within a certain geographical area surrounding the facility; this effect does not extend beyond 1000 kilometers from its location. This phenomenon has been observed on numerous occasions but its cause remains unknown.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19081</i> is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times. Any attempts to access the facility must be reported immediately and denied. All personnel entering or leaving <i>SCP-19081</i> must be thoroughly searched for any items of interest.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of false information, a disinformation campaign has been established in the surrounding area. Additionally, a team of agents have been assigned to monitor and intercept any suspicious activity related to <i>SCP-19081</i>'s operations.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19081.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an undercover Foundation agent was able to infiltrate <i>SCP-19081</i> and observe its operations. During his time there he discovered that the facility is in fact run by a group of Russian intelligence officers who have been tasked with manipulating public opinion for the benefit of their government.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19081.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19081</i> Personnel<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of Foundation agents infiltrated <i>SCP-19081</i> and conducted an interview with one of the facility's personnel. During the course of the interview, it became apparent that <i>SCP-19081</i> was being used as a tool by the Russian government to influence public opinion in its favor. The following is an excerpt from the transcript:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> So you're saying that the stories you create are partially or fully true?<br><b><br>Personnel:</b> Yes. We have access to sophisticated algorithms which allow us to accurately identify potential targets for our propaganda campaigns as well as track their responses. Once fabricated stories have been disseminated by us they become partially or fully true within a certain geographical area surrounding the facility; this effect does not extend beyond 1000 kilometers from its location.<br><b><br>Agent:</b> What is the purpose of this?<br><b><br>Personnel:</b> The goal is to create a false narrative that will be accepted by the public as fact. This allows us to control public opinion and shape it in favor of the government's agenda.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19081.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted in order to determine the effects of <i>SCP-19081</i>'s fabricated stories on public opinion. A false story was created claiming that a new law had been passed allowing for the legalization of certain recreational drugs. The story was then broadcasted across multiple media outlets within 500 kilometers from <i>SCP-19081</i>'s location.<br><br>The results of the experiment showed that public opinion regarding drug use shifted significantly in favor of legalization within one week after the story's release; this shift remained consistent even after two weeks had passed since its initial dissemination.</div>
