It has no distinguishing features except for the presence of an additional keyhole on the main zipper. The object's anomalous properties manifest when any object capable of fitting within its dimensions is placed within it and locked using the aforementioned key. Upon doing so, its volume will increase in proportion to the size of the object placed inside it, allowing it to contain objects up to approximately 12m3 (equivalent to about eight large filing cabinets) without discomfort for most humans or other animals expected to be used as test subjects.<br><br>When <i>SCP-9179</i> contains an object too large for it, there will be a rapid expansion of space inside <i>SCP-9179</i> until such a point that all test subjects exposed are killed by sudden internal pressure changes, which have been recorded at up to 400 kPa (44 psi). Due to this effect, testing has been halted indefinitely while attempts are made at finding ways around this problem. If properly sealed after each use and kept secure from outside access , however, there have been no reports of incidents relating directly back to removal tests on <i>SCP-9179</i>; therefore testing may resume once again pending approval from O5 Council members .<br><br>[[collapsible show=<i>"+ Open Testing Log 9179 - Close Testing Log 9179"</i> hide=<i>"-"</i>]]<br><br><br>Experiment #: 1 Date: 5/14/<br>2008 Location: Site-19 Test Subject(s)<br>: D-2845 Procedure: D-2845 was instructed not touch <i>SCP-9179</i> during testing but instead look into one end and describe what he saw there.<br> Results: Subject reported seeing nothing unusual before being terminated upon reaching full compression due his head becoming trapped between two adjacent walls; note that after this point it was impossible for him reach breathable air through any means besides breaking down either wall before expiration took place .<br> Experiment #: 2 Date: 5/15/<br>2008 Location : Site 19 Test Subject(s)<br>: D -2249 Procedure : D -2249 was instructed insert whole hand into one end ,<br> pull out pencil then return hand inside and repeat process until unconsciousness took place Results : Researchers were able select appropriate sized item each time without issue; subject expired after reaching full compression due her head becoming trapped between two adjacent walls; note that after this point it was impossible reach breathable air through any means besides breaking down either wall before expiration took place . Experiment #3 Date 7<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9179</i> was recovered from a pawnshop in Tijuana, Mexico on ██/██/200█. The object had been sold as <i>"The Bag of Endless Possibilities"</i>, which was found to be trademarked by Vango Limited; when Foundation agents attempted to retrieve the object, they were knocked unconscious by the seller before being taken into custody. The seller himself was later revealed to be an anomalous humanoid entity with solid white eyes and no facial features named <i>"The Shopkeeper"</i>. He claimed that <i>SCP-9179</i> had originally come from another dimension where it belonged to an individual known only as <i>"The Master"</i> who would use it to find new people and objects that caught his interest .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9179.1 :</h3> Additional recovery information regarding <i>SCP-9179</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9179.2 :</h3> Experiment Log 9179-5</div>
