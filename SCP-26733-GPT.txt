    <h1>SCP-26733</h1>
<h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26733</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26733 is a geographic anomaly located on the shore of [REDACTED], measuring approximately 1.2 kilometers in length. The anomaly's primary effect is an apparent reversal or significant slowing of the aging process for organic life forms that remain within its boundaries. This effect begins within 5 to 15 minutes of exposure and is progressive, with initial signs including revitalization of skin, heightened energy levels, and the gradual healing of minor ailments. Prolonged exposure leads to more pronounced rejuvenation, potentially including the reversal of age-related conditions such as arthritis, organ degeneration, and in some documented cases, early-stage dementia.</p>
<p>The beach's anomalous properties do not seem to extend beyond the immediate coastline, and the effects are temporary, reversing upon the subject's departure from the area. However, the rate of reversal varies significantly among subjects. Flora within the affected area exhibits unusual longevity and vigor, with some plant species not native to the region thriving unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Research into the cause of these properties is ongoing, with current hypotheses focusing on a combination of local magnetic field anomalies, uncharacteristic mineral deposits within the sand, and unidentified organic compounds present in the seawater.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-26733 is to be contained in situ by the establishment of a perimeter around the affected area under the guise of environmental protection. The perimeter is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times, and public access is strictly forbidden. Any attempts to enter the area are to be deterred under the pretense of seismic activity or preservation efforts. Misinformation campaigns are in effect to discredit any reports of the anomalous properties of SCP-26733.</p>
<p>Research personnel are to conduct experiments in a controlled manner, with exposure times strictly regulated to prevent unforeseen complications from overexposure. All subjects involved in testing must undergo a full medical evaluation before and after exposure to SCP-26733.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment 26733-A:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-8432, a 58-year-old male with signs of moderate aging.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was instructed to remain on the beach for a period of 30 minutes.
- <strong>Results:</strong> Subject displayed visible signs of rejuvenation, approximately appearing to be in his early 50s by the end of exposure. Effects began reversing 3 days after removal from the area.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26733-B:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-7165, a 73-year-old female with advanced rheumatoid arthritis.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject spent 1 hour on the beach.
- <strong>Results:</strong> Significant improvement in mobility and pain reduction during exposure. Age appearance regressed to approximately 60 years old. Reversal of effects commenced within 1 week.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26733-C:</strong>
- <strong>Subject:</strong> D-6129, a 43-year-old male with early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
- <strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject remained on the beach for 2 hours.
- <strong>Results:</strong> Noticeable cognitive improvement and memory recall during exposure. Physical appearance regressed to mid-30s. Full return of Alzheimer's symptoms 2 weeks post-exposure.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Interview Log</h3>
<p><em>The following is an excerpt from an interview with Dr. Emilia Torres, lead researcher for SCP-26733.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Simon Grant
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Emilia Torres</p>
<p>[EXCERPT BEGINS]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> "Dr. Torres, can you explain the implications of SCP-26733's properties?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> "Certainly. The potential for therapeutic applications is enormous. Imagine being able to temporarily regress the effects of degenerative diseases or even extend the vitality of an individual's life. However, it's crucial to understand the limits and potential side effects of such exposure."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> "Have there been any adverse effects noted in subjects?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> "Aside from the disorientation associated with rapid physiological changes, we've not observed long-term detrimental effects. However, we've yet to test the impact of exposure beyond a few hours. It's critical we proceed with caution. The mechanisms behind SCP-26733 could easily be a double-edged sword."</p>
<p>[EXCERPT ENDS]</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Report 26733-Î”</h3>
<p>On [DATE REDACTED], a containment breach resulted in the unauthorized access of SCP-26733 by civilians. A family of three, including a child, entered the restricted area and were exposed for an estimated 4 hours before Foundation agents could intervene. The family experienced significant rejuvenation but were successfully administered amnestics and released without recollection of the event.</p>
<p>The containment breach highlighted the need for enhanced security measures, including improved surveillance and more extensive misdirection tactics. As a result of this event, the perimeter was extended, and additional personnel were assigned to SCP-26733's containment team. Further research into preventing unauthorized access without raising public suspicion is ongoing.</p></div>
