Testing of <i>SCP-15309</i> is currently prohibited.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15309</i> is a black Oppo magic mobile phone. <i>SCP-15309</i> has the ability to render itself and all of its components invisible. It can also render other objects invisible by touching them with its antenna, which causes the touched object to become intangible for approximately one hour before returning to normal. <i>SCP-15309</i> is capable of teleporting itself and other objects from one location to another by touching them with its antenna, which causes both the object and the antenna to disappear for approximately five minutes before reappearing at their new location.<br><br><i>SCP-15309</i> was recovered from an electronics store in [REDACTED], India after reports of it causing several customers' cellphones and wallets to disappear were reported; however, no such items were found in or around <i>SCP-15309</i>'s vicinity. The store manager claimed that he had sold it only ten minutes prior at a discounted price due to a <i>"glitch"</i> in its software that made it unable to make calls or send text messages; however, when questioned further about this supposed <i>"glitch"</i>, he could not provide any details on what exactly caused this problem or how they fixed it (see Addendum 15309-1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15309.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ██████, manager of the electronics store in [REDACTED], India where <i>SCP-15309</i> was recovered<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent Alan Goldstein </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview was conducted to determine the origin of <i>SCP-15309</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>Goldstein: </b>So, Mr. ██████, you said that you sold this phone at a discounted price due to a <i>"glitch"</i> in its software? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Yes sir. It couldn't make calls or send text messages and it had some weird symbols on the screen that I didn't recognize so I thought it might be broken or something so I gave it away for free with an old phone I had lying around here somewhere if you want to take a look at it? Agent <br><br><b>Goldstein: </b>No thank you; we'll let your employees handle that one. Now, can you tell me how exactly did this <i>"glitch"</i> occur? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Well…I'm not really sure myself actually but my boss told me he found out about it from his friend who works in some big company called Oppo or something like that and apparently they were selling these phones for cheap because their factory made too many of them or something like that and they were all defective somehow so he bought about fifty of them off his friend and gave them away with other stuff we had lying around here just to get rid of them since no one would buy them anyway but then when people started complaining about their things disappearing after they picked up these phones from us he told me not to sell any more until we figure out what's going on here because apparently there are more than just those fifty phones missing according to my boss' friend who works at Oppo…but anyways yeah basically is what happened; now if you don't mind could we please end this interview now because my shift ended ten minutes ago and I'd really like go home now… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following the interview, several Foundation agents searched through all employee records for anyone working under the name <i>"Oppo"</i>, however no such individual was found working for any company within a 50 kilometer radius of [REDACTED].

The subject was then told to touch the antenna of <i>SCP-15309</i> against his arm and then attempt to pick it up again. After this test, D-9341 was instructed to touch his arm again with the antenna of <i>SCP-15309</i> and observe what happened. <br><br><b>Results: </b>When D-9341 placed the antenna of <i>SCP-15209</i> on top of the ballpoint pen, it immediately disappeared from view; however, when he attempted to lift it off with his hand or move any part of his body towards it, he reported that <i>"it felt like there's something in between [him] and [the object]"</i>, preventing him from doing so. When he touched his forearm with the antenna of <i>SCP-15209</i> after this test had concluded, both disappeared for approximately three seconds before reappearing at their previous positions; however, upon touching them together again after this second disappearance had occurred for approximately one minute (in order not to cause any further interference), they both immediately disappeared for a third time before reappearing at their original positions once more (see Addendum 15309/3). Test #: 2<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Same as Test 1. However in addition one glass bottle filled with water will be placed on top of a table next to where D 9341 is standing . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as test 1 <br><br><b>Results: </b>As soon as D 9341 picked up glass bottle filled with water , It instantly vanished into thin air . After which , when he tried picking up glass bottle filled with water , It instantly vanished into thin air once more . After which , when he tried picking up glass bottle filled with water once more , It instantly vanished into thin air yet again . No matter how many times we tested this experiment over & over again , same results were observed every single time . Experiment Log 15309 - Close Addendum 15309/1: On ██/██/20██ an interview was conducted by Dr ██████ regarding how exactly did they fix said <i>"glitch"</i> in its software that made it unable to make calls or send text messages without causing any further interference during tests conducted by Foundation personnel (See Interview Log 153091) Interviewed <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Mr ████████ Srivastava <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview took place via telephone due to Mr Srivastava being unavailable at Site 77 during its scheduled date due several issues regarding work commitments related issues; therefore an audio recording device has been placed near speaker phone located inside containment locker containing SCP - 153 09 <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr ██████ Hello?

What do you want me ask ? Dr ██████ Well firstly do you know how did your store manage acquire such item ? Mr Srivastava Oh yes ! I remember now ! A man came into my store about two weeks ago asking me if I would be interested buying this magic phone off him saying that someone gave him but didn't need anymore because she already got herself another one ! And since my store doesn't really sell cellphones much these days thought why not take chance while offer still available right ?
