It is to be fed twice daily with 2 kg of raw meat, and given access to a small room containing a bed and toilet facilities. <i>SCP-15252</i> has shown no interest in escaping from its containment cell or attacking personnel unless provoked by speech .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15252</i> is a humanoid entity, approximately 2.4 meters tall and weighing in at 200 kg. <i>SCP-15252</i> has been described as appearing to be Caucasian in appearance, with a long beard and hair reaching down to its waist. It wears the remains of an old Russian Orthodox priest's robe, which appears to have been altered for its size.<br><br><i>SCP-15252</i> possesses extreme physical strength beyond that of an ordinary human being, allowing it to lift large objects such as cars and concrete blocks above its head with ease. It also possesses extreme resistance to damage from conventional weaponry, including gunfire and explosives; however it is vulnerable to damage from bladed weapons such as swords or axes. <i>SCP-15252</i> has been observed moving at speeds greater than 30 km/h when running towards a target; however it appears unable or unwilling to move quickly when not charging towards something or someone.<br><br><i>SCP-15252</i>'s primary anomalous property manifests when any person attempts communication with it; upon hearing any words spoken by a subject (hereafter referred to as <i>"the speaker"</i>), <i>SCP-15252</i> will immediately charge towards the speaker at high speed regardless of distance between them, even if they are behind solid walls or other obstacles blocking line of sight between them (see Addendum). The time taken for this charge varies depending on distance but averages around 5 seconds after the first word is heard by <i>SCP-15252</i>; once within approximately 20 meters of the speaker <i>SCP-15252</i> will attack by swinging its arms violently while shouting incoherently in Russian (it should be noted that no one who has encountered 1552 speaks fluent Russian). If contact between 1552 and the target occurs then they will invariably die within 5 seconds unless protected by some form of durable armor capable of stopping heavy blows from blunt weapons such as axes or hammers (see Addendum). The force generated by these blows can easily crack concrete slabs several centimeters thick into pieces up to 10 cm across without slowing down significantly during their swing . During this time all bodily functions cease except for heart rate which remains elevated until death occurs . After attacking 1552 will return back into whatever position it was originally standing before hearing speech from the target . This process repeats indefinitely until terminated using conventional means . In addition , if left uninterrupted for longer than 3 minutes then 1552 may begin repeating [REDACTED] over and over again until terminated using conventional means ; this effect does not seem limited only during attacks on targets , but rather seems activated whenever anyone speaks more<br><br><h3>Addendum 15252.1 : </h3>  <i>SCP-15252</i> was recovered from the town of ████████, Arkansas after reports of a <i>"Russian demon"</i> attacking people . When Foundation operatives arrived they found that 15252 had been attacking and killing civilians in an attempt to reach a man known as <i>"Father ████"</i>, who it was apparently trying to kill. Father ████ was found dead at his church with multiple injuries consistent with 15252's attacks.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15252.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████, a local resident who witnessed 15252's attacks on Father ████.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview took place at the town of [REDACTED] in Arkansas, where witnesses to <i>SCP-15252</i>'s attacks were being questioned by Foundation operatives . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Okay Mr. [REDACTED], can you tell me what happened? Can you describe the events leading up to Father ████'s death? <br><br><b>Witness: </b>Well I was just walking home from work when I heard all this yelling coming from the church . It was that Russian guy who lives there with Father [CENSORED] shouting something about killing him and how he would never die! Then he started running towards the church so I ran inside and told everyone to lock themselves in their houses; then I called 911 but they couldn't do anything because it wasn't happening here in town . <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So did you see what happened? <br><br><b>Witness: </b>No , but when I looked out my window after everything went quiet there was blood all over the steps leading up to his door , so… (Witness begins crying) …I know that he's dead… <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Thank you for your time Mr.[REDACTED]. You may go now . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it became clear that <i>SCP-15252</i> had killed several civilians as well as Father [CENSORED] before Foundation operatives arrived on scene and terminated it using conventional means (see Incident Report 15252/a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15252.3 : </h3>Experiment Log:<br><br>Experiment 15252-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15252, a Caucasian male weighing 70 kg.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to stand in front of <i>SCP-15252</i> while wearing heavy body armor. The armor is then struck with a steel hammer at high speed by an automated robotic arm . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon the first strike <i>SCP-15252</i> immediately charges towards D-15252 at speeds greater than 30 km/h, causing the armor to shatter into pieces and killing D-15252 instantly . Experiment <br><br><b>15252-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-12239, a Caucasian male weighing 75 kg. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As per Experiment 15251 but with a wooden shield instead of body armor. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon the first strike <i>SCP-15251</i> immediately charges towards D -12239 and strikes him in the chest; however due to his body being protected by the shield he survives for 5 seconds before dying from internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma . Experiment 15251 -3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A live pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) weighing approximately 50 kg <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As per experiment 1 but with no protection other than its skin <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon hearing speech from the subject SCP -152 52 begins charging towards it at speeds greater than 30 km / h , breaking through its skin and killing it within 5 seconds of contact . Further testing on animals has shown that any living creature that hears speech will be attacked regardless of size or species (see Addendum).</div>
