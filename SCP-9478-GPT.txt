Upon discovery, it was found that <i>SCP-9478</i> did not appear on any maps or satellite images. Subsequent research revealed no records of such a structure being built in the area, nor is there any indication that it had been destroyed and rebuilt at another time.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9478</i> was recovered on ██/██/200█ when Agent ███ accidentally stumbled upon it during a hike with his family. Further investigation revealed that no other individual had knowledge of <i>SCP-9478</i> prior to its recovery by the Foundation.<br><br><br>Interview Log: The following is an interview conducted with Agent ███ shortly after the discovery of <i>SCP-9478</i>. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> Richards: Hello, Agent ███, how are you today?<br> Agent ███: I'm fine, thank you for asking Dr.<br> Richards: Now then, let's begin; do you know why we brought you here?<br> Agent ███: Well… I guess it's because you want to learn more about what happened up in the mountains that one time… Dr. Richards nods and begins typing on a laptop sitting in front of him while he speaks again. Dr.<br> Richards: That's right - we're interested in learning more about your experience climbing Mount Greenly last week - can you<br><br><h3>Addendum 9478.1 :</h3> On 26/10/200█, <i>SCP-9478</i> was found to be surrounded by a flock of birds at all times. The flock's numbers varied between ███ and █████ individuals, but they would always prevent any physical contact with <i>SCP-9478</i>. Due to this observation, testing was discontinued until further notice.<br><br>On 17/02/200█, the flock of birds surrounding <i>SCP-9478</i> suddenly disappeared during a windstorm that lasted for approximately 30 minutes. During this period, Foundation agents were deployed to the area under the guise of hikers who had become lost in the mountains due to weather conditions. After waiting for approximately 20 minutes, a small group of researchers entered <i>SCP-9478</i> and reported that they had located an anomalous object inside which they believed to be responsible for creating and maintaining the anomaly around itself as well as disappearing without a trace when exposed to wind speeds over 6mps (approximately 32km per hour). Further exploration is being considered pending approval from O5 Command and further resources are currently being diverted towards research into such anomalies ahead of possible future events similar to what is believed occurred on 17/02/200█ .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9478.2 :</h3><br><br>On 27/02/200█, an exploration team was dispatched to the top of Mt. Greenly in order to capture images and recordings of <i>SCP-9478</i>, as well as investigate the surrounding area for any clues regarding its origins. The team consisted of two (2) D-Class personnel accompanied by two (2) armed guards and three (3) researchers from Site-04's Anomalous Objects research department.<br><br>The exploration team arrived at Mount Greenly on schedule and began climbing the mountain without incident until they reached ground level below <i>SCP-9478</i>. While there were no visible signs that <i>SCP-9478</i> was guarded or inhabited by any type of lifeform, the entire area around it appeared to be under a heavy fog which prevented them from observing it properly from a distance greater than 3 meters away from it. As such, they were forced to move closer in order to investigate further but stopped after noticing several small birds circling above them at all times which made further investigation impossible due to fear that they may disturb these birds accidentally if they got any closer than 3 meters away from <i>SCP-9478</i> itself . All attempts made by members of the exploration team over next six hours in order <i>"catch"</i> one or more birds failed due to their high mobility in combination with their abundance throughout the region - despite their constant circling above <i>SCP-9478</i>, none remained within reach for longer than five seconds before quickly moving out of range again .<br><br><br>At approximately 13:24 local</div>
