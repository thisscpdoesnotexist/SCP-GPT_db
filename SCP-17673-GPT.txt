<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17673 is  Papa Oni's Pizzeria; a pizzeria run by an Oni</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17673<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17673</i> is an anomalous pizzeria located in ██████, Japan. The establishment is owned and operated by Papa Oni, a humanoid entity that appears to be a large Oni with red skin and horns.<br><br>The interior of the store has been described as being “unusually spacious”, despite its small size on the outside. Inside the shop are several tables and chairs for customers to sit at while they eat their pizza. There are also two counters where customers can order their food from Papa Oni himself.<br><br>Papa Oni's menu consists of various types of pizzas, all made with ingredients that appear to have been taken directly from Japanese folklore or mythology (e.g., tengu wings, dragon scales). All orders are prepared fresh and cooked in what appears to be a large clay oven behind the counter. Customers who have eaten at <i>SCP-17673</i> report feeling unusually full after eating even small amounts of pizza from Papa Oni's menu; however, no adverse effects have been reported thus far.<br><br>When asked about his background or how he came into possession of <i>SCP-17673</i>, Papa Oni simply states that he has always been here and will continue running his business until it closes down one day due to lack of customers or other circumstances beyond his control<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17673</i> is to be monitored at all times by personnel assigned to Site ██. No personnel are to enter the premises without prior authorization from a Level 3 or higher staff member. All customers entering <i>SCP-17673</i> must be monitored and questioned upon leaving the establishment.<br><br>Any attempts by Papa Oni to leave his shop must be reported immediately and prevented if possible. If it becomes necessary, MTF Epsilon-9 (<i>"Nine Tailed Foxes"</i>) is authorized to use force in order contain Papa Oni within <i>SCP-17673</i>'s premises.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17673.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, MTF Epsilon-9 was dispatched to <i>SCP-17673</i> in response to reports of a large group of Oni gathering outside the establishment. Upon arrival, it was discovered that Papa Oni had been hosting a party for several other Oni from the local area. All present were questioned and released without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17673.2: </h3> Interview with Papa Oni<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Papa Oni<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Researcher ████<br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> <i>"Papa Oni, can you tell us about your pizzeria?"</i><br><b><br>Papa Oni:</b> <i>"My pizzeria has been here for a long time. I make all the food myself using ingredients from Japanese folklore and mythology. It's something I enjoy doing and it brings me a lot of joy."</i><br><b><br>Researcher ████:</b> <i>"What made you decide to open up a pizzeria?"</i> <br><b><br>Papa Oni:</b> <i>"I wanted to bring some of the flavors of Japan to people who may not have ever experienced it before. I thought that by making pizza with ingredients like tengu wings and dragon scales, I could give people a taste of something truly unique. Plus, it's fun to make and serve food that is so different from what they're used to."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 17673.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers was sent to <i>SCP-17673</i> in order to observe and document Papa Oni's anomalous properties. The following is a log of their findings:<br><br>• Upon entering the shop, all personnel reported feeling an uncomfortable presence that seemed to be emanating from Papa Oni himself.<br><br>• Several customers were observed ordering pizzas from Papa Oni; each customer reported feeling extremely full after eating only one slice of pizza. After finishing their meals, the customers all appeared to be in a dazed state for several minutes before leaving the establishment.</div>
