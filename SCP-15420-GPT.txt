At least 3 armed guards are to be stationed outside of its containment chamber at all times in order to prevent any unauthorized access towards it. Any personnel who have been affected by <i>SCP-15420</i>'s anomalous properties are to be immediately taken into custody and treated with Class A Amnestics (See Addendum 15420-A).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15420</i> is an IT conference held in █████████, Germany. <i>SCP-15420</i> was discovered after reports of a large number of attendees leaving the event with severe hearing loss and mild to severe brain damage.<br><br><i>SCP-15420</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual spends more than 5 minutes at the event. These effects include:<br><br>Auditory hallucinations that cause the subject to perceive all speech as extremely dull, repetitive and monotone. This effect will persist for up to 24 hours after leaving <i>SCP-15420</i>'s area of effect, even if no auditory stimulus is present. Subjects are not able to overcome this effect by themselves but can be helped through treatment with amnestics or Class A amnestics (See Addendum 15420-A). Subjects who have experienced this form of auditory hallucination are hereafter referred to as <i>SCP-15420</i>a.<br><br>Sudden onset boredom which causes subjects to become extremely apathetic about their surroundings and any task they may be performing at the time (See Addendum 15420-B). This boredom will persist for up to 24 hours after leaving <i>SCP-15420</i>'s area of effect, even if no visual stimulus is present . Subjects who have experienced this form of boredom are hereafter referred as <i>SCP-15420</i>b . When questioned about their current state, affected individuals report feeling <i>"extremely bored"</i> despite being unable to recall what they were doing before becoming affected by said boredom . The only way for a subject affected by this phenomenon can be brought out from it without outside intervention is through exposure towards other humans or animals that display emotional responses towards stimuli such as laughter or affectionate gestures (See Addendum 15421). Any attempt made on behalf on researchers working on Project Cimmerian using Class A Amnestics has been met with failure due its inability in curing subjects suffering from said condition (See Experiment Logs 15421 - 15423) . However , when exposed towards individuals displaying these emotions , subjects report feeling <i>"slightly less bored"</i> and regain control over their motor functions within 2 minutes , although they still remain completely uninterested in whatever activity they were previously performing before exposure took place . It should also be noted that any attempts made at exposing subjects suffering from said condition towards other humans or animals displaying negative emotions such as anger or fear has proven ineffective due its inability in causing any change whatsoever within them (See Experiment Logs 15400 - 15403) . As such , it has been deemed impossible for these individuals<br><br><h3>Addendum 15420.1 : </h3>【 LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED 】 Access Granted Prior to Incident 15420-A, no attempts made on behalf of the Foundation to contain <i>SCP-15420</i>'s anomalous properties were successful due to its lack of similarities with any known anomaly. However , after Incident 15420-A took place, it was discovered that <i>SCP-15420</i>'s anomalous properties could be suppressed through the usage of Class A amnestics (See Addendum 15421). As such , a containment protocol has been put in place in order to prevent any further spread of its effects.
