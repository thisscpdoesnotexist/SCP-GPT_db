<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-16084</i> is  a vinyl record that teleports the listener to an alternate dimension</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-16084</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-16084</i> is to be kept in a standard Safe-class storage locker at Site-19. Testing with <i>SCP-16084</i> is currently suspended pending further research into its properties and the development of a method for safely containing <i>SCP-16084</i>'s alternate dimension.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16084</i> is a vinyl record titled <i>"The Best of the Beatles Vol. 1"</i> by The Beatles. It was produced by EMI Records in 1976 and distributed worldwide. <i>SCP-16084</i>'s anomalous properties only manifest when it is played on a turntable with a tracking force of at least 3 grams; any lesser force will result in no anomalous effects being produced.<br><br>When played under these conditions, the listener will be transported to an alternate dimension (designated <i>SCP-16084</i>-1) for approximately 15 minutes before returning to the location from which they started listening to <i>SCP-16084</i> . This effect occurs regardless of whether or not anyone else is present at that location when <i>SCP-16084</i> is played, though listeners who are alone may experience an additional auditory hallucination where they are joined by other people while listening to <i>SCP-16084</i> . These people do not exist outside of this hallucination and have no effect on reality, as confirmed through experimentation (see Addendum 16084/B).<br><br><i>SCP-16084</i> was recovered from ██████ High School in ████████, England following reports that several students had disappeared after listening to it during lunch break. Class A amnestics were administered and all witnesses were given false memories consistent with the cover story involving a gas leak; all affected students were returned to their homes without incident.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16084.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████<br><br>The following interview was conducted with a student who had disappeared while listening to <i>SCP-16084</i>. The student, hereafter referred to as <i>"█████"</i>, was returned to their home by Foundation agents shortly after the incident and interviewed shortly thereafter.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Agent ██████████ <br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>█████ ███████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>██████████: </b>Hello, █████. I'm going to be asking you some questions about what happened today at school. Can you tell me what happened? <br><br><b>█████: </b>I dunno… I just left the cafeteria and started walking down the hall, and then everything went dark for a bit before I woke up in my room. Agent <br><br><b>██████████: </b>So you don't remember anything else? Not even how you got home? <br><br><b>█████: </b>No… wait! There was this weird guy in my room when I woke up! He wasn't there when I went to sleep last night, so it must have been him that brought me back here! It looked like he'd been sleeping on my bed for a while too… Agent <br><br><b>██████████: </b>What did this man look like? Was he wearing anything unusual or carrying anything with him? <br><br><b>█████: </b>No… it's hard to describe him actually; he looked sort of blurry around the edges or something. He didn't say anything either; he just stared at me until my parents came in and saw him there too. They freaked out pretty bad but they let me stay here instead of taking me back to school like they said they would earlier today. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After interviewing several other students affected by <i>SCP-16084</i>'s effect, it became clear that all descriptions of <i>SCP-16084</i>-1 were consistent regardless of who accessed it or how many people accessed it simultaneously; all descriptions matched those given above by ██/██/20██ subject D-7821 (see Addendum 16084/B). This suggests that <i>SCP-16084</i> is not capable of transporting multiple listeners into its alternate dimension simultaneously; however, no method has yet been developed for containing <i>SCP-16084</i>'s alternate dimension long enough for further research into this matter .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16084.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 16084-01<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-16084-1, a male Doberman Pinscher; <i>SCP-16084</i> played on a Technics SL-1200MK2 turntable with tracking force set to 3.5 grams.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject was transported to an alternate location that appeared to be an empty field, and was joined by three other canines (one male and two female) of various breeds, including one that resembled <i>SCP-1131</i>. All four animals had no physical substance present in our dimension and were not observed by any surveillance equipment present in the testing chamber at the time of the test. The four animals walked around for approximately 15 minutes before fading from view; subject returned shortly afterwards. Subject displayed signs of distress following this test, but did not require medical attention or amnestic treatment. Following this experiment, all further tests with <i>SCP-16084</i> have been suspended pending development of a method for safely containing its alternate dimension and preventing exposure to potential cognitohazards produced by <i>SCP-16084</i>'s effect .<br><br></div>
