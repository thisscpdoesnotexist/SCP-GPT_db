How are you feeling? <br><br><b>D-10610: </b>I'm fine, thank you for asking doctor… wait… what did you say your name was again? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>I didn't say anything, but it's nice to meet you too! Now then, how are things going with your new body? You've been in there for a few hours now haven't you? D-10610 appears visibly shaken by this question and begins to cry softly into her claws. After several minutes she responds with a muffled <i>"yes"</i>. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well that is certainly something! How do they feel? Are they as comfy as they look? Do they work well enough for everyday tasks like eating and drinking and so on? D-10610 continues crying silently into her claws for several more minutes before responding with <i>"I don't know."</i> <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well that's certainly understandable! It must be hard adjusting to such an extreme change all at once like that! So tell me about the first thing you tried doing after waking up in there… (D- 106 10 pauses for several seconds before responding) D -1 06 10: …I tried getting out of bed . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview ended here when SCP personnel entered the room and sedated subject 106 10 .

D-10610 is to be fed one (1) live crab per day for one (1) week. All non-crab organisms are to remain present in the subject's vicinity at all times during this period. After the week has elapsed, any non-crab organisms within <i>SCP-10610</i>'s vicinity are to be removed from the subject's vicinity and returned to their natural habitats. The subject will then be observed for two (2) weeks after removal of non-crab organisms from its surroundings as per Procedure 10610/A/B/C/D/E . If any anomalous properties manifest after two weeks, SCP classification is to be upgraded and containment procedures updated accordingly.<br><br><b>Results: </b>No anomalous properties manifested within two weeks of removal of non crab organisms from SCP 10610's environment . Subject was released and allowed access back into general population with no ill effects noted by researchers or staff interacting with Subject afterwards .<br><br></div>
