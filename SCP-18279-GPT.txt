It appears to be completely omniscient and capable of manipulating reality at will. However, it displays the same behavior as an ordinary duck, such as preening its feathers and quacking.<br><br><i>SCP-18279</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it perceives a threat or potential danger to itself or others in its vicinity. In these situations, <i>SCP-18279</i> will use its powers to neutralize the threat by whatever means necessary; this can range from causing objects around it to move on their own accord in order to block incoming projectiles or creating illusions that distract attackers long enough for them to be subdued by security personnel.<br><br><i>SCP-18279</i> does not appear hostile towards humans unless provoked and will often attempt peaceful resolutions before resorting to more direct methods of protection if necessary. Interviews with <i>SCP-18279</i> have revealed that it claims to have been created by an unknown entity for unknown reasons but has since developed sentience on its own over time.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18279</i> is to be contained in a standard aviary at Site-██. The aviary should be equipped with a variety of toys and objects for <i>SCP-18279</i> to interact with, as well as food and water dishes.<br><br>Personnel are not to enter the containment area without prior approval from the site director. Any personnel found attempting to provoke or harm <i>SCP-18279</i> will be reprimanded accordingly.<br><br>In the event that <i>SCP-18279</i>'s anomalous properties manifest, security personnel are to observe from a safe distance until it has neutralized the threat before intervening if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18279.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18279</i> was observed attempting to communicate with a group of ducks in the aviary. It is unclear what it said, but all of the other ducks quickly ran away from it in fear.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18279.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18279</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-18279</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-18279</i>, can you tell me why you were created?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18279</i>:</b> I was created to protect those who cannot protect themselves. That's all I know.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18279.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 18279-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18279</i><br><b><br>Procedure:</b> A small group of hostile personnel were sent into the containment area to provoke and attack <i>SCP-18279</i>. The subject was observed for any anomalous activity.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Upon entering the containment area, <i>SCP-18279</i> immediately created a large wall of solid stone that blocked off the entrance to prevent further entry.

After several minutes, all hostile personnel had been neutralized without injury or death due to <i>SCP-18279</i>'s intervention.</div>
