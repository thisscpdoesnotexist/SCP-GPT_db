Are you ready?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9102</i>: Sure, what do you want to know?<br><br>Dr.<br> ██████: Well, how did you get stuck in the mirror? <i>SCP-9102</i> looks at his reflection in the mirror and thinks for a moment.<br> <i>SCP-9102</i>: I don't really remember too well… All I remember is getting hit on my head when I was looking into the mirror, and then waking up inside it… Dr.<br> ██████: What do you mean by <i>"hitting your head"</i>? Did someone hit you with a baseball bat or something like that? <i>SCP-9102</i> gets angry at this remark.<br> <i>SCP-9102</i>: No! It wasn't a bat or anything like that! Just a normal stick! Please don't treat me like an animal doctor, okay?! Dr. ██████ tries to calm down 9102 with another question before he loses his temper again . Dr.<br> ██████ : Sorry about that 9102 , so let's try this again… Who did it with the stick? Was it a man or woman ? Or maybe just a kid ? <END LOG> Note from Dr.: After giving him some water and letting him calm down we started talking about other things until he finally told us everything he knows . Even though we have no proof that someone else actually put him in there , we have no other explanation on how he got there . So let's start over (again) : We need more information on how exactly did this happen… Addendum 9102_2 [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [END LOG><br><br><h3>Addendum 9102.2 :</h3> Testing Logs</div>
