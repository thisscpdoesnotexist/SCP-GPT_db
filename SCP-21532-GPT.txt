Its skin appears to be composed of a black, leathery material similar to that found on the exterior of an asteroid.<br><br><i>SCP-21532</i> has no visible eyes, ears or mouth but instead possesses two large nostrils located at the top of its head which are capable of expelling air at high speeds. It has no discernible form of locomotion and instead moves by levitating through space at speeds up to 30 km/s when not contained within an area with gravitational forces present.<br><br>When exposed to living organisms <i>SCP-21532</i> will attempt to infect them with an anomalous virus known as <i>"the Zombie Virus"</i>. This virus causes rapid decay and death in any organism it is introduced into, eventually transforming them into zombie-like creatures under the control of <i>SCP-21532</i> itself. The infected creatures can then be used as puppets by <i>SCP-21532</i> for various purposes such as attacking other nearby organisms or carrying out specific tasks given by it telepathically.<br><br>In addition, if left unchecked for too long <i>SCP-21532</i> may begin converting entire planets into zombie hordes under its control before moving on elsewhere in search of new victims or resources needed for further infection events.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21532</i> is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell should be equipped with a reinforced titanium door and multiple layers of security systems including motion sensors, infrared cameras, and automated defense systems.<br><br>The area surrounding the containment cell must also be monitored for any signs of zombie activity or other anomalous phenomena. If any such activity is detected then additional personnel are to be dispatched to investigate and contain the situation as soon as possible.<br><br>In addition, all personnel entering the vicinity of <i>SCP-21532</i>'s containment chamber must wear protective gear designed to prevent infection by the Zombie Virus. Furthermore, no living organisms are allowed within 10 meters of its containment chamber unless absolutely necessary for testing purposes or approved research projects involving<br><br><h3> Addendum 21532.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ resulting in the release of <i>SCP-21532</i>. The entity was eventually re-contained after several personnel were killed and numerous infected creatures were destroyed. In order to prevent further incidents of this nature, additional security measures have been put into place around <i>SCP-21532</i>'s containment chamber.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21532.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21532</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-21532</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-21532</i>. Can you tell me why you have been infecting living organisms with the Zombie Virus?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21532</i>:</b> I am seeking to spread my power and influence throughout the universe.
