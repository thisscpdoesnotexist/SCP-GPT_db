When worn, <i>SCP-17592</i> will project an aura of red light onto the subject being viewed, highlighting any potential issues or problems they may have.<br><br>The glasses are made out of a lightweight metal frame and feature tinted lenses that make it difficult to distinguish what color the aura is. The exact composition of this material is unknown.<br><br>When worn by personnel, <i>SCP-17592</i> has been observed to cause mild discomfort in those wearing it for extended periods of time due to its weight on their nose bridge and temples. It also causes minor headaches after prolonged use as well as blurred vision when not in use.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17592</i> appear to be limited only to living beings, as no anomalies were detected when viewing objects or nonliving entities through them. Furthermore, subjects who are already aware they possess certain flaws do not seem affected by the glasses’ effects; instead seeing nothing but darkness while wearing them.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17592</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██.

They were instructed to report any visible red flags that they noticed. <br><b><br>Results:</b> The subject reported seeing several red flags, such as one individual being hostile towards another, another appearing to be lying about something, and a third displaying signs of addiction. All observations made by the subject were accurate.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17592.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Subject D-17592, who was exposed to <i>SCP-17592</i> for testing purposes.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> How did you feel when wearing the glasses?<br><b><br>Subject D-17592:</b> At first I felt uncomfortable, like something was pressing against my face and making it hard to breathe. But then I started seeing these red auras around people's heads and it made me realize how many problems they had that I didn't know about before. It made me think twice about interacting with them in certain ways or offering advice because of what the glasses revealed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17592.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> A Level 3 researcher was instructed to wear <i>SCP-17592</i> and observe a group of individuals in a public park. The researcher reported seeing an aura of red light around each individual, with the intensity varying depending on their behavior. Those who were more aggressive or hostile had brighter auras, while those who were more passive or friendly had dimmer ones.<br><b><br>Experiment #2:</b> A Level 4 researcher was instructed to observe a classroom full of students while wearing <i>SCP-17592</i>. The researcher reported that the majority of the students had faint red auras, which seemed to become brighter when they became agitated or angry about something. One student in particular stood out due to having an extremely bright aura that pulsed with intensity whenever he spoke up in class or made any kind of comment.</div>
