Each one grants a different power to the wielder (the ox talisman grants superhuman strength, etc…)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17762<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17762</i> is a set of twelve talismans, each corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac. The talismans are made from an unknown material and appear to be indestructible. Each talisman has a unique design that corresponds to its respective animal, and when held by a living organism it grants them abilities related to the animal it represents (e.g., the ox talisman grants superhuman strength).<br><br>When multiple <i>SCP-17762</i> instances are held by different individuals, they will experience an effect known as 'zodiac resonance', which causes their powers to interact with each other in unpredictable ways. This can range from simple interactions such as increased power for both users or more complex effects such as granting new abilities or changing existing ones.<br><br>When all twelve instances of <i>SCP-17762</i> are brought together, they form a single larger entity with immense power over reality itself - however this entity has not yet been observed due to its extreme rarity. It is theorized that if all twelve instances were used at once, their combined powers could potentially cause catastrophic damage on a global scale.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> All instances of <i>SCP-17762</i> are to be kept in secure containment at Site-██. Access is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. Any attempts to use multiple instances of <i>SCP-17762</i> simultaneously must be approved by the O5 Council before proceeding.<br><br>In the event that all twelve talismans are found together, they must immediately be separated and returned to their respective containment units. Under no circumstances should any attempt be made to use all twelve talismans at once - doing so could potentially cause a global catastrophe.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17762.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of twelve individuals were discovered in possession of all twelve <i>SCP-17762</i> instances. The individuals claimed to be part of an ancient cult dedicated to the worship of the Chinese zodiac and had been using the talismans for various rituals. All instances were successfully recovered and returned to containment without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17762.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><br>Dr. ██████, a researcher specializing in Chinese mythology, was interviewed regarding <i>SCP-17762</i>:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I've heard of these talismans before, but never seen them in person. How did you come across them?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> We recovered the talismans from an ancient temple in China, where they had been sealed away for centuries. It appears that they were created by a powerful sorcerer long ago and intended to be used as part of a ritual to gain ultimate power over reality itself - however this ritual was never completed due to the sorcerer's death before it could be finished.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Do we know what would happen if all twelve talismans were used together?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Unfortunately not - due to their rarity and the potential danger posed by their combined power, we have never attempted to use them all at once. We can only theorize that the results would be catastrophic on a global scale.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17762.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17762.1:</b> On ██/██/20██, two instances of <i>SCP-17762</i> (the dragon and the tiger talismans) were given to two D-Class personnel for testing. The subjects reported feeling an increased strength and agility, as well as a heightened sense of awareness. After several minutes of testing, the effects began to dissipate and both subjects returned to baseline levels after approximately one hour.<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17762.2:</b> On ██/██/20██, four instances of <i>SCP-17762</i> (the ox, snake, horse and monkey talismans) were given to four D-Class personnel for testing. The subjects reported feeling an increased level of strength and speed beyond what was experienced in Experiment 17762.1 - however they also reported experiencing a strange sensation that seemed to be coming from all four talismans simultaneously. This sensation was described as being 'like something inside them was trying to get out'. After several minutes of testing the effects began to dissipate and all four subjects returned to baseline levels after approximately one hour</div>
