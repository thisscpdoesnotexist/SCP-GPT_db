It has been inscribed with a series of symbols, runes, and words written in an unknown language believed to be related to Sumerian cuneiform writing.<br><br>When <i>SCP-21129</i> is read aloud by any human subject within 10 kilometers of its current location, it will cause the immediate manifestation of an entity designated as <i>SCP-21129</i>-1. The entity appears as a humanoid figure composed entirely out of black smoke or energy which stands at approximately 2 meters tall and has no discernible facial features or appendages aside from two large wings protruding from its back.<br><br><i>SCP-21129</i>-1's primary purpose appears to be the protection and preservation of knowledge; when exposed to any form of information (written text, spoken dialogue etc.) that it deems important enough for preservation it will manifest itself immediately within 10 kilometers regardless if <i>SCP-21129</i> is being read aloud or not. Once manifested, <i>SCP-21129</i>-1 will absorb the information into its body before disappearing again without leaving any trace behind save for the original source material being left undamaged but destroyed beyond repair due to exposure to extreme heat generated by SCP 21129’s manifestation process.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21129</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██. No personnel are allowed access to the object without prior approval from the site director. Any attempts to read aloud or otherwise activate <i>SCP-21129</i> must be approved by two level 4 personnel and monitored closely for any anomalous activity.<br><br>In the event of an activation, all personnel within 10 kilometers of <i>SCP-21129</i>’s current location must evacuate immediately and all information sources within that radius should be secured until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21129.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to activate <i>SCP-21129</i> in an attempt to gain further insight into its anomalous properties. The entity manifested as expected and immediately began absorbing all information available within the laboratory before disappearing again shortly thereafter. After the incident, all personnel involved were administered Class A amnestics and the laboratory was sealed off from access until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21129.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21129</i>-1<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of researchers led by Dr. ███████ conducted an interview with <i>SCP-21129</i>-1 in order to gain more information on its purpose and origin. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> “What is your purpose?”<br><b><i>SCP-21129</i>-1:</b> “I am here to protect knowledge, both ancient and modern. I am tasked with ensuring that nothing is lost or forgotten over time.” <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> “Who gave you this task?” <br><b>SCP 21129-1:</b> “My master has no name, only a title. He is known as the Guardian of Knowledge.” <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> “And where does he come from?” <br><b><i>SCP-21129</i>-1:</b> “He is from beyond this world, a place that cannot be reached by mortal means.” <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> “And why did he give you this task?” <br><b><i>SCP-21129</i>-1:</b> “He believes that knowledge is the most powerful force in existence, and it must be preserved for all eternity.” <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> “And how do you go about fulfilling your task?” <br><b><i>SCP-21129</i>-1:</b> “I absorb any knowledge that I deem important enough to be preserved, and store it within my being until it is needed again.”<br><br><h3> Addendum 21129.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 21129-1<br><b>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to read <i>SCP-21129</i> aloud in a secure testing chamber.<br><b>Results:</b> Upon completion of the reading, <i>SCP-21129</i> manifested itself within the chamber and proceeded to absorb all written material present in the room before disappearing again without leaving any trace behind. No anomalous activity was observed during or after this event.</div>
