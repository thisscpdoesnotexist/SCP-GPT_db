After Incident 15314/1, Agent ██████'s injuries were treated and he was given Class C amnestics. The following day, Dr ████ noticed that the face of <i>SCP-096</i> resembled that of Agent ██████ and notified the rest of Site 19 staff via email about this discovery. As a result, all personnel are required to report any injuries they sustain from contact with <i>SCP-096</i> immediately so they can be treated and amnesticised if necessary.<br><br>Incident 15314/2: On 9/03/20██, Dr ████ accidentally cut his finger on a scalpel while performing an autopsy on D-(934) (a deceased instance of D-(934)), causing him to bleed onto the corpse's remains as per standard procedure for handling D-(934). Two hours later when he returned home from work he discovered that his finger had become infected by some unknown bacteria or virus which caused it to swell up and become extremely painful. He sought medical attention at [REDACTED] Hospital where doctors diagnosed him with sepsis due to Staphylococcus Aureus infection (which is not usually associated with cuts) and began treatment using antibiotics effective against said infection . However despite receiving treatment for several days his condition worsened until he could no longer stand without assistance due to severe pain in his legs caused by blood clots in them . He died on 11/03/20██ after suffering multiple organ failures including kidney failure , respiratory failure , heart failure , liver failure , brain death resulting in death followed shortly afterwards by cardiac arrest . Autopsy revealed significant damage done by numerous internal bleeding lesions throughout most major organs including lungs , kidneys , liver etc . It is believed that these lesions were caused either directly or indirectly due to infection spread through bloodstream as well as possible complications during surgery performed during initial diagnosis at [REDACTED] Hospital which may have resulted in further damage done either directly or indirectly through introduction of foreign bodies into bloodstream such as surgical instruments used during surgery along with their respective bodily fluids potentially containing said bacteria or virus responsible for infecting Dr ████<br><br><h3>Addendum 15314.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████, the wife of Dr ████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with ███████ █████, the wife of Dr. █████████ who was infected by <i>SCP-096</i> during Incident 15314/2 and died as a result. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Mrs. █████, can you tell us exactly what happened to your husband? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Well… he had just finished performing an autopsy on D-(934) when he cut his finger on a scalpel while washing it off in the sink in the morgue . He didn't think much of it and went home after work like normal but then later that night he started complaining about how painful his finger was so I took him to see a doctor at [REDACTED] Hospital . They diagnosed him with sepsis due to Staphylococcus Aureus infection (which is not usually associated with cuts) and began treatment using antibiotics effective against said infection . However despite receiving treatment for several days his condition worsened until he could no longer stand without assistance due to severe pain in his legs caused by blood clots in them .

The body had been kept in cold storage for the past two days since its discovery by Dr ████ during Incident 15314/2. Upon opening the body bag and starting the autopsy, Dr ██████ noticed that the face of <i>SCP-096</i> resembled that of himself. He then proceeded to cut open D-(934)'s abdomen and remove its internal organs for examination. Approximately five minutes later, he began feeling a sharp pain in his abdomen which quickly spread throughout his whole body causing him to collapse onto D-(934). Researches present at Site 19 immediately administered first aid treatment using standard protocols after which he regained consciousness but continued to feel severe pain in his abdomen as well as some parts of his upper torso including chest , arms , shoulders and neck . He was then transported via ambulance to [REDACTED] Hospital where doctors diagnosed him with appendicitis caused by Salmonella Typhi infection (which is not usually associated with cuts) and began treatment using antibiotics effective against said infection . However despite receiving treatment for several days his condition worsened until he could no longer stand without assistance due to severe pain in his legs caused by blood clots in them . He died on 13/03/20██ after suffering multiple organ failures including kidney failure , respiratory failure , heart failure , liver failure , brain death resulting in death followed shortly afterwards by cardiac arrest .
