The binder is capable of altering its size and shape to fit any user, regardless of body type or size.<br><br>When worn by an individual, <i>SCP-17114</i> will cause the wearer to experience severe physical pain in their chest area. This pain will increase over time and eventually become unbearable if not removed within one hour after being put on. After this point, the user's chest area will begin to transform into that of Miku Hatsune's own body structure; including her signature hairstyle and clothing style as well as her voice becoming similar to hers.<br><br>The transformation process can be reversed if <i>SCP-17114</i> is removed within two hours after it was put on; however, any attempts at removing it before this point are met with extreme resistance from both the binder itself and the subject wearing it, resulting in further physical harm to them both.<br><br>Once fully transformed into Miku Hatsune's form, subjects have been observed displaying various abilities similar to those seen in other depictions of her character such as singing proficiency (in multiple languages) or superhuman strength/speed/agility etc., depending on what version they have been changed into. Subjects also display an increased affinity for technology and robotics related items/systems which may be used for their own benefit or detriment depending on how they choose to use them; although no malicious intent has ever been observed thus far from any subject changed by <i>SCP-17114</i> so far.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17114</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to the item must be approved by Level 3 personnel or higher.<br><br>Any personnel found wearing <i>SCP-17114</i> are to be immediately removed from it and placed into medical observation for 24 hours before being allowed back into active duty. Any personnel found exhibiting signs of transformation due to <i>SCP-17114</i> are to be placed in long term containment until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17114.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to remove <i>SCP-17114</i> from a subject who had been transformed by it for over two hours. The attempt was met with extreme resistance from both the binder and the subject, resulting in the death of one researcher and severe injuries to three others. After this incident, all attempts at removing <i>SCP-17114</i> have been suspended until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17114.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17114</i>-1<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-17114</i>-1 (formerly known as ██████ ████)<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> <i>SCP-17114</i>-1 was the first human subject to be transformed by <i>SCP-17114</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello, ██████. How are you feeling today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17114</i>-1:</b> I'm… okay I guess? It's still a bit weird getting used to this new body and all. But it's not so bad once you get used to it.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> That's understandable. Can you tell me what happened when you put on <i>SCP-17114</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17114</i>-1:</b> It was… intense. I felt a sudden pain in my chest, like someone was squeezing it really hard and then it just kept getting worse until I couldn't take it anymore and had to take the binder off. When I did, everything changed; my body, my voice, even the way I think and feel about things has changed too. It's all very strange but… kind of exciting at the same time too.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> I see. Do you have any idea why this happened to you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17114</i>-1:</b> No, not really. I mean, I guess it could be because of the binder itself or maybe something else entirely; but either way, it's been an interesting experience so far.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you have any plans for the future now that you've been changed?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17114</i>-1:</b> Well, I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my new body and abilities. But I do know one thing; I want to use them for good, not evil. So whatever happens from here on out, it'll be something positive and helpful in some way.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17114.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> Subject D-17114 was instructed to put on <i>SCP-17114</i> and report any changes they experienced.<br><b><br>Result:</b> After one hour, the subject began to experience severe pain in their chest area and eventually became unable to move due to the pain. After two hours, the subject's body had fully transformed into that of Miku Hatsune's form with all its associated abilities. The transformation process was reversed after <i>SCP-17114</i> was removed from them.</div>
