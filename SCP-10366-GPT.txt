The door leading into the room must have a keypad lock installed on it, and access to the room must be granted by two Level 3 personnel. All cameras that are connected to <i>SCP-10366</i>'s database are to be disconnected from any computer or power source and stored in a separate locker within Site 23. Any mirrors located within Site 23 are not affected by <i>SCP-10366</i> and can remain as they currently are; however, all personnel entering or exiting Site 23 must not look into any of these mirrors for longer than 5 seconds at a time.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10366</i> is a machine-learning algorithm meant to identify faces, but it anomalously alters people's appearances to match a given face instead.<br><br><i>SCP-10366</i> was created by the Foundation in an attempt to create a facial recognition software that could be utilized by the Foundation for identification purposes. The software was tested on D-Class personnel and researchers with no success, but after testing on Agent ████████ the results were deemed successful enough for further testing. The software was then installed into all security cameras at Site 23 and has been used since as an identification tool for personnel entering and exiting the site.<br><br>The anomalous effects of <i>SCP-10366</i> will occur when a person looks at their reflection in any camera or mirror that is connected to <i>SCP-10366</i>'s database (the mirrors located within Site 23 are not affected). If they look at themselves long enough, they will begin to notice their appearance changing gradually until it matches that of another person in the database (usually someone who works at or has visited Site 23). This change takes about 5 minutes from initial viewing. As of now there are over 200 people whose appearances have been altered by <i>SCP-103666</i>; however, these changes have only occurred within Site 23 itself as no one outside of this area has reported any changes in appearance while looking into any camera connected with SCP 103666's database. It is currently unknown if this effect extends beyond Site 23's boundaries or if there are other locations where this effect occurs; however, it is theorized that there may be more instances like SCP 103666 elsewhere due to its similarity with other instances such as SCP 939 and SCP 1548 . Any attempts made so far have failed due to lack of information regarding possible locations where similar technology may exist .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10366.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████ ████████, a researcher who had his appearance altered by <i>SCP-10366</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Agent ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Agent ████████ was selected for interview due to his familiarity with the workings of <i>SCP-10366</i> and its database. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Good morning, Agent. Please state your name for the record. Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>My name is █████████ . I'm a Level 2 researcher here at Site 23 and I've been working with SCP 103666 since it was installed into the security system here about two years ago. <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation, █████████ . Now let's get started on your experience with SCP 103666 up until now; when did you first notice something changing? Agent <br><br><b>████████: </b>Well I noticed it right away actually; as soon as I looked into one of the cameras that were connected to it my appearance changed to match someone else's in the database immediately after looking at myself in a mirror located near my desk at work…I didn't think much of it until later on when more people started noticing their appearances changing too…that's when we realized there might be something wrong with this machine learning algorithm we created and contacted you guys immediately after that…I don't know how many people have been affected by this thing so far but if anyone else has noticed anything like this happening please contact us through our office or email us directly if they're not authorized enough to come here personally…and please hurry before more people are affected! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement:: After reviewing this interview, all personnel within Site 23 were instructed not to look into any cameras or mirrors connected with <i>SCP-10366</i>'s database while outside of their designated areas within Site 23 itself (the only exception being those who are currently working on stopping/containing instances similar to these). All other personnel outside of Site 23 should remain cautious while using any camera or mirrors within their area as well as report any changes in appearance immediately upon noticing them .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10366.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment 10366-1 - Experiment 10366-1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-93421<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to look into the camera for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, subject was told to look at the mirror in front of him. <br><br><b>Results: </b>D-93421 looked into the mirror for about 30 seconds before stating that he felt a <i>"weird sensation"</i> and then proceeded to exit the room without looking back at his reflection. When questioned on what he meant by this, D-93421 stated that while looking at himself in the mirror he noticed that his appearance had changed slightly; however, it did not match any images of personnel located within SCP 103666's database and therefore could not be identified as anyone else working at Site 23. When asked if there were any other noticeable changes in appearance, D-93421 stated that while looking into the mirror he saw a <i>"blurry image"</i> behind him which seemed familiar but couldn't be identified as anyone else either. This is likely due to SCP 103666's anomalous effects . + Experiment 10366 -2 - Experiment 10366 -2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Researcher ████████<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher ████████ was instructed to look into camera for 5 minutes before looking into a nearby mirror . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Researcher ████████ looked directly into camera for about 15 seconds before turning away from it and towards a nearby wall where she remained for another minute before turning back towards camera again . She then began staring directly at her reflection in an attempt to identify herself; however, after approximately 3 minutes she turned around and exited room without saying anything further on why she left or what she thought of her appearance . + Experiment 10366 -3 - Experiment 10366 -3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Agent ████████ (SCP 939) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Agent ████████ was instructed to look directly at his reflection in one of Site 23's mirrors. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Agent █████████ stared directly at himself with no signs of distress or discomfort until after 2 hours had passed when he suddenly turned around and walked out of room without making any comments regarding his appearance or actions taken during testing period .<br><br></div>
