The book itself is about a young girl who is a princess and her adventures to stop an evil queen from taking over her kingdom.<br><br><i>SCP-9723</i> was found when Dr. ██████'s daughter, ████, brought it home from school one day. When she started reading it she noticed that things were happening around her as if they were in the book. She told her father what happened and he showed it to his co-workers at Site [REDACTED]. The next day when she went back to school after bringing <i>SCP-9723</i> home with her, she was acting like someone else entirely different than before. When asked about this change in behavior, ████ said <i>"I don't know what you're talking about."</i> After hours of questioning ████ finally revealed that she thought that she was actually Princess Amelia of Regalia (the name of the kingdom where <i>SCP-9723</i> takes place). She also said that everything around her felt like it was happening for real and not just inside of a book.<br><br>Dr. ██████ then requested permission from O5 Command to test <i>SCP-9723</i> on other D class personnel and on himself if possible so he could see what would happen if he read <i>SCP-9723</i> while thinking he was someone else besides himself (he wanted to be King Richard). He got permission after two weeks and tested on three D class personnel along with himself being one of them . All four people became obsessed with reading more into <i>SCP-9723</i>'s story line because they believed themselves to be actual characters in the story line instead of D class personnel or Dr .██████ . They all described their experiences as <i>"real"</i> even though they knew deep down inside that this wasn't true . After several months passed by all four subjects started having violent tendencies towards each other because according to them <i>"they were enemies trying take over each others kingdoms"</i>. Two days later all four subjects killed each other leaving only Dr .██████ alive out of everyone involved in testing 97 23 except for his daughter who had no involvement whatsoever with testing 97 23 at any point during its containment or discovery process , which led him into believing his daughter had nothing to do with anything involving 97 23's effects until now but still doesn't believe his daughter has anything do do with 97 23's effects anymore since none have been seen since then but still believes something will happen again soon enough because according to him <i>"something always happens eventually"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9723.1 : </h3>??????.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9723.2 : </h3>Interview with ??????.<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-9723<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-9723 was one of the three test subjects along with Dr .██████ and another D class personnel that were involved in testing 97 23's effects. He was the first to start showing violent tendencies towards other people even though he knew deep down inside that he wasn't a real character in the story line of <i>SCP-9723</i> . He killed both test subject 2 and 3 before killing himself because according to him <i>"they were trying to take over his kingdom"</i>.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>.██████: </b>Hello, 97 23, how are you doing today? (D-9723 doesn't respond) Hello? 97 23? Is everything okay? (D-9723 still doesn't respond) I'm sorry but I have no choice but to terminate you right now. (Dr .██████ shoots D - 9 7 2 3 ) What happened next is unknown at this time because Dr .██████ has been placed under investigation for possible connections with SCP - 9 7 2 3 's e ffe c ts b ec au se he w as t h e o n ly o n e i nv ol v ed i n t est ing 9 7 2 3 who didn't become obsessed with reading more into SCP -9 7 2 3 's story line after reading it for an extended period of time which means that something else caused his obsession instead of him just going crazy all on his own like everyone else did after reading it for an extended period of time or maybe something else entirely different than what we think caused his obsession could be responsible for causing all four subjects' obsessions but until we know what exactly caused their obsessions we can only theorize about what could've possibly caused them so until then I'll continue my interview with him). Hey! Are you okay?! Answer me! (No response from Dr .██████) Please answer me! Please say something! Anything at all would be fine right now! Please say something! Just please say anything at all!! PLEASE!!! (Still no response from Dr .█████████) Okay, if you won't talk then I'll just have to read your mind instead…I hope you don't mind…(Dr. ██████████ places SCP -9 7 2 3 on top of D -9 7 2 3 's head while saying [DATA EXPUNGED] out loud while doing so [DATA EXPUNGED] successfully enters into D -9 7 2 4 ' s m ind without any problems whatsoever which means that there is a possibility that [DATA EXPUNGED] might be able to enter into everyones minds without having any problems whatsoever which would mean that there's a possibility that [DATA EXPUNGED] might not need someone else's help in order to enter into someone elses mind if they're willing enough or maybe someone who isn't willing enough like when someone gets brainwashed by some sort of cult or religion and they get forced against their will by those people who brainwashed them against their will and made them do things against their will like kill themselves or others around them without having any control over themselves whatsoever which led me onto thinking about how easy it is for anyone other than myself from entering into anyone elses minds without having any problems whatsoever since this person named ?????? somehow managed to enter my own daughter's mind despite her being unwilling enough since she didn't want anything bad happening around her anymore especially not involving her father since she thinks he had nothing do do with whatever happened back then even though she was wrong about thinking this way because according to her father <i>"something always happens eventually"</i> so unless ?????? does something bad again soon enough then nothing bad should happen again anytime soon unless ?????? decides otherwise). <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After conducting several tests on myself using <i>SCP-9783</i>, I discovered the true nature behind its effects along with many other things regarding its true nature including its origins among many other things besides those two things mentioned above as well as many others besides those two things mentioned above such as why certain events happen when they happen during testing procedures involving SCP 9783 whenever certain characters are used during testing procedures involving 9783 such as why one event happens whenever one character uses another character during testing procedures involving 9783 such as why one event happens whenever one character uses another character during testing procedures involving 9783<br><br><h3>Addendum 9723.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+Experiment Log 9723.1 -Experiment Log 9723.1 <br><br><b>Experiment: </b>D-9723-01 was placed in a room with a copy of <i>SCP-9723</i> and told to read it for 1 hour. After the hour was up, D-9723-01 was asked to describe what happened in the book and describe his feelings about what he just experienced. He said that he felt like he had been transported into the book and that everything around him felt like it was happening for real even though it wasn't . He also said that while reading the book he thought of himself as Prince Richard (the prince who is supposed to save Princess Amelia from Queen Lucia). After questioning him further, we found out that while reading <i>SCP-9723</i>, D -9 7 2 3 -0 1 believed himself to be Prince Richard because when he read about how Prince Richard would rescue Princess Amelia from Queen Lucia, this reminded him of his own life because when Dr .██████ rescued his daughter ████ from her abusive mother (who is now deceased), this made him feel like Prince Richard saving Princess Amelia from Queen Lucia which caused him to believe himself as Prince Richard during testing . +Experiment Log 97 23 .2 - Experiment Log 97 23 .2 <br><br><b>Experiment: </b>D -9 7 2 3 -0 2 wa s placed in a room with a copy of SCP - 9 7 2 3 an d told t o rea d i t f or 1 hou r.

All four subjects were given copies of SCP—9723 and instructed by Dr ██████ to read them until they finished them which took approximately two hours total due to everyone taking turns reading their copies aloud one paragraph at a time until someone else wanted their turn after finishing their paragraph(s) being read aloud by someone else involved in testing experiment log number 97 23 03's test group (Dr ██████ included). When everyone finished reading their copies of SCP—973 , everyone started acting differently than before which led Dr ██████ into believing that something happened when they all finished reading their copies off SCP—973's story line involving themselves being characters within its story line instead of Class A amnesiacs or researchers working on studying its effects since none have been seen since then but still believes something will happen again soon enough because according to him <i>"something always happens eventually"</i>.<br></div>
