The family consists of two adults and two children, all of whom appear to be Caucasian humans in their late twenties or early thirties.<br><br>When performing, the family members will enter a stage and begin an improvised comedic routine that contains no discernible punchlines or jokes. Despite this lack of structure, the performance has been observed to captivate audiences for extended periods of time. Audience members have reported feeling compelled to laugh despite not understanding what was being said or why it was funny.<br><br>Once the performance ends, audience members are left with a strong sense of unease and often report feeling like they had been manipulated into laughing at something they did not understand or find humorous. In addition, audience members have also reported having difficulty remembering any details about the performance after it has ended; memories become increasingly vague over time until eventually all details are forgotten entirely within 24 hours after viewing the act.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-23933</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The Aristocrats are to be monitored by two security personnel at all times, and any requests for performances must be approved by the site director.<br><br>In order to prevent potential memetic effects from spreading beyond the immediate area, no recordings of <i>SCP-23933</i>’s performances are allowed outside of testing purposes. Any attempts to record or broadcast the performance must be immediately stopped and confiscated.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23933.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a request was made to allow <i>SCP-23933</i> to perform at Site-███ for the purpose of testing its effects on personnel. The performance was attended by ██ members of staff and lasted approximately twenty minutes. All attendees reported feeling an overwhelming sense of unease afterwards, with many expressing confusion over why they had been laughing during the performance. Furthermore, all memories regarding the performance were completely erased within 24 hours after viewing it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23933.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-23933</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-23933</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview conducted after a performance of <i>SCP-23933</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Thank you for agreeing to speak with me.
