<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-11184</i> is  â€¦ wellâ€¦ The real SCP is the friends we made along the way. ðŸ™‚</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-11184</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-11184</i>, it is currently impossible to contain it. The Foundation has been given permission by the government of Canada to set up a research facility in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, Canada in order to study <i>SCP-11184</i> and its anomalies.<br><br>The Canadian government has also been notified that any civilians who enter <i>SCP-11184</i> will be detained and questioned regarding their knowledge of the anomaly. Any civilians who are found guilty of knowing about or having had contact with an anomaly within <i>SCP-11184</i> will be administered Class A amnestics and released back into society.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11184</i> is a collection of various anomalies, each with its own unique properties. Anomalies are either inanimate or animate, and can be sentient or non-sentient. They possess their own unique abilities and characteristics. Some of the anomalies are capable of causing physical harm to humans, while others do not cause any harm at all. Some anomalies have the ability to communicate verbally with humans; some can only communicate through telepathy; and some cannot communicate at all.<br><br><i>SCP-11184</i> was discovered by the Foundation on â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/20â–ˆâ–ˆ after a series of disappearances were reported in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, Canada . The disappearances were attributed to <i>SCP-11184</i> until it was discovered that they were caused by an anomaly from within <i>SCP-11184</i> itself. After further investigation into the matter it was determined that there is no known way to contain <i>SCP-11184</i> as it is currently unknown how many anomalies exist within its borders, nor if they will ever stop appearing due to lack of knowledge regarding what causes them to appear in the first place (See Addendum 11184a).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11184.2 : </h3>Interview with â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, a civilian who was found within <i>SCP-11184</i> after being reported missing by his family. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>Hello, Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. I'm going to be asking you some questions regarding your disappearance. The first question is how did you get here? <br><br><b>Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>I don't know what you mean, sir; I've always lived in this town my whole life! Agent <br><br><b>â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>That's not what the records say, Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ€¦ According to the records that we have on file, you were born in [REDACTED]. You moved to Canada when you were 15 years old and lived here ever since then until your disappearance two weeks agoâ€¦ Now can you tell me where exactly it is that you went missing from? <br><br><b>Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>I was at home watching TV with my wife and kids when a bright light appeared outside our windowâ€¦ It looked like a car had crashed into our house or something because it came out of nowhere! When we got outside there was nobody around except for this weird looking guy who said he could take us somewhere safe if we wanted to come with himâ€¦ We decided to go with him because the house was really getting damaged by whatever had hit it and we didn't want anything bad happening to us or our kids so we grabbed whatever stuff we could carry and left with him before the police showed up! Agent <br><br><b>â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>And where did he take you? Was it somewhere far away from here? <br><br><b>Mr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: </b>No sir; he just took us through an alleyway behind our house and brought us back into town but on the other side of town from where we live now! He said that if anything bad happened again then all of us should meet back there in case something else happened so that way none of us would get lost or separated from each other again! He also told me not tell anyone about what happened today because they wouldn't believe me anyway because they would think I'm crazy for saying such things about an alleyway behind my own house! Agent â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ pauses for several seconds before continuing the interview <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview ended at this point due to <i>SCP-11184</i>'s anomalous properties becoming active during its questioning which caused both <i>SCP-11184</i> itself as well as its surrounding area (including Agent) to become non-anomalous (See Addendum 11184b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11184.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment Log 11184a:<br><br>Subject(s): D-11184, D-11185, and D-11186.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>All three subjects were given a map of â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, Canada and instructed to walk through the town until they reached <i>SCP-11184</i>. They were then instructed to enter the anomaly and report anything that they witnessed or experienced during their time inside. After their return, all three subjects were interviewed regarding their experience within <i>SCP-11184</i>. The following is an excerpt from the interview with D-11185:<br><br><b>D-11185: </b><i>"It wasâ€¦ different."</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b><i>"Different how?"</i><br><br><b>D-11185: </b><i>"Wellâ€¦ I don't know if you've ever been to â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ before but it's just one of those places where nothing interesting happens."</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b><i>"So you're saying that there was something interesting about your trip into SCP-"</i><br><br>D-111 85:<i>"No! That's not what I'm saying! It wasâ€¦ weird . There were these people walking around like nothing was wrong even though there wasn't any sun in the sky or anything."</i> Interviewer:<i>"How did you feel about this?"</i> Subject:<i>"I don't know; confused mostly? Like I said earlier, it's just a boring place so seeing people walking around like it was normal kinda creeped me out."</i> Interviewer:<i>"And what happened after that?"</i> Subject:<i>"We kept walking until we found this building with a sign outside saying 'The Rusty Moose'. We decided to go in because we figured we could use some food since we hadn't eaten lunch yet."</i> Interviewer:<i>"What happened inside?"</i> Subject:<i>"There weren't any tables or chairs inside so we figured it must have been some sort of bar. We ordered some food from this guy behind the bar who looked like he'd seen better days (See Addendum 11184b). He gave us our drinks which tasted kinda funny but whatever; beggars can't be choosers right? Anyway after about 10 minutes of eating our food these two guys came up to us asking for money for gas or something so we gave them all our change which ended up being $4 altogether . They thanked us and left almost immediately afterwards ."</i> Interviewer:<i>"What happened next?"</i> Subject:<i>"After they left these two other guys came up asking for money as well only they wanted $10 each instead of $4 . We told them no because we didn't have any more money on us at the time but they didn't seem too happy about it ."</i> Interviewee r:<i>"Did anything else happen ?"</i> Subject:<i>"Yeah , one guy pulled out a knife while another pulled out a gun . They both pointed them at my friend who got scared and ran outta there as fast as he could ."</i> Interviewee r<i>":What did you do ?"</i> Subject:<i>"Me? Well I just sat there waiting for someone to come save me because I knew nobody would believe me if I told anyone what really happened here ."</i> Intervi ewer:<i>"And then what hap-"</i> S ubject (interrupting): <i>"Oh yeah , forgot to mention that while all this shit is going down outside , my friend comes running back into The Rusty Moose screaming his head off telling everyone that those two guys are trying t o kill him ! Everyone starts panicking when suddenly one guy pulls out an AK 47 and shoots both of those assholes dead right in front o f everyone without missing once ! Then he turns around shooting every single person in sight except my friend who hid under his table before he started shooting again! There has t o be over 20 bodies lying on top of each other on th e floor by now!"</i> Intervie w er (taking notes): <i>"â€¦ And then !"</i> Subjec t (interrupting again) <i>"â€¦ Oh yeah , forgot another thing ; when everyone stopped moving outside the guy turned towards my friend hiding under th e table screaming 'Come here!' My friend freaked out thinking he would get shot too so he ran away instead only for him not t o shoot him either ! He chased after him until finally catching up with hi m near an alleyway where he grabbed him by his arm dragging hi m behind some bushes where nobody can see them â€¦â€¦"</i> Intervie w er(taking notes): <i>"â€¦ And then ?!"</i> S ubject(interrupting once more)"â€¦ Oh yeah</div>
