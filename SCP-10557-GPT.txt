The room contains one chair and one table, both made out of wood.<br><br><i>SCP-10557</i> was discovered inside the ████████ Hotel in ██████████ , California by Agent ████████ on 03/04/20██ after reports of a burning woman were made to the local police department . After investigation from Agent ████████ , it was found that there had previously been several accounts of people hearing screaming coming from Room #14 at night. When questioned about this, the hotel staff reported that Room #14 had previously been rented to two men who were never seen during their stay there. It was also found that no records existed for these two men prior to their stay at the hotel .<br><br>When approached by Agent ████████ , <i>SCP-10557</i> did not respond verbally but instead began screaming loudly and flailing her arms around erratically before collapsing into flames again . She then stood back up and continued her erratic movements until she collapsed again; she then repeated this pattern until Agent ████████ left the area . Further attempts to communicate with <i>SCP-10557</i> have failed due to her lack of response; however, it is assumed that she can hear any communication directed towards her due to her reactions while being spoken too . She will also react if any person or object comes within 4 meters of herself or enters within 1 meter if they are carrying anything made out of metal (such as keys) or wearing clothing made out metal (such as jewelry). If an attempt is made contact with anything metallic while within 1 meter radius around herself, she will immediately collapse into flames again before standing back up and continue moving about erratically until either said object leaves or disappears from view . In addition, when given food without utensils (such as fruit), she will eat it directly off the surface it lies on without burning herself; however when given food using utensils (such as sandwiches), she will burn themself attempting to pick them up off their surface before collapsing into flames again. In addition, whenever water comes in contact with <i>SCP-10557</i>'s body via any means other than rain , sprinklers or accidental spills caused by personnel working near containment cell 1057A1 - such as splashing against said body - she will immediately collapse<br><br><h3>Addendum 10557.1 : </h3> <br><br><i>SCP-10557</i> was initially contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with the exception of a 2cm deep layer of water covering the floor. The cell contained one chair and one table, both made out of wood. <i>SCP-10557</i> did not react to anything around her, and would remain motionless for extended periods of time before suddenly collapsing into flames again . She then stood back up and continued moving about erratically until she collapsed again; this pattern repeated itself every few hours .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10557.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-10557</i><br><br>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ on 04/11/20██.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-10557</i>, my name is Dr. ██████ and I am here to ask you a few questions about yourself and your current situation . Are you able to understand me?<br><br><b><i>SCP-10557</i>: </b>Yes… I can hear you… but I cannot respond… it hurts so much…<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please try to remain calm; we are working as fast as we can to find a way for you to be able to communicate with us without causing harm to yourself . Can you tell me what happened before your arrival at the hotel?<br><br><b><i>SCP-10557</i>: </b>[Silence] …I do not know how long ago it was; there is no day or night here now, only burning and pain… there were two men who had been staying in the room next door for several days; they never came out of their room except when they needed something from the front desk or when they ordered food from room service . They always talked about how easy it would be for them if they could just get rid of me and make sure no one ever found my body so that no one would ever know what happened here . One day while I was walking down the hallway towards their door, one of them opened his door slightly enough so that he could see me through his peephole; he then closed his door quickly before opening it again with a knife in hand , which he then held up against the peephole before closing it again ; this repeated itself several times until eventually I heard him say <i>"I think she's gone now"</i> ; shortly after hearing this, their door opened and both men came out holding knives in each hand . They walked over towards where I was standing but did not notice me due to my body being covered by shadows casted by an overhead light hanging above them ; however once they reached where I stood , both men looked directly at myself - who had already collapsed into flames - yet neither man attempted stabbing himself with any of his knives despite having seen my body right in front of them (this may have been due [DATA EXPUNGED] ). The two men then began talking amongst themselves about how <i>"easy"</i> killing me had been , along with some other things that made no sense at all until eventually one man said something along the lines of <i>"Let's go back inside our room now"</i> ; after saying this , both men turned around and walked back into their hotel room without ever noticing myself collapsed onto ground next beside them . It wasn't until later that night when someone called 911 reporting screaming coming from Room #14 (where these two men were staying) that anyone discovered myself lying on ground outside Room #14 covered in burns from being exposed sunlight during daylight hours while still being surrounded by shadows casted by an overhead light hanging above ground level outside said hotel room's window . After finding myself like this , paramedics rushed myself off site via ambulance immediately after putting out fire covering my entire body using water hoses attached directly onto ambulance itself (due [DATA EXPUNGED] ) ; however even though water put out fire covering self completely almost instantly upon contact between said liquid & self , paramedics noticed large amount blood pouring out mouth & nose area - despite fact fact fact ict t th hat h water putted ouut ffi iree covverriing ll mmyy bboooody yyy ccoommppllleee ttttiimmmesssss uunnnddderr ggrraaavvee rreeessttsss oofff ppaarrrttteerrrss sttuuffffiiccttioonn nsseeecceesee iinnn nneeedd ddeettthhiisss mmeemmoooorrrrr rreessscchhhuuunnn naaammmeenntt eennnttrraanngggeerr ssoopuurrrp plleeaasee iinnss sseet tthhee ggrraaaaaaaaaiinngggg wweeeelllll ?!??!?!?!!!!!!!<i>" !?!?!?!?!"</i>!?!<i>"!?!"</i>!?!<i>"!?!?"</i> !?<i>" !?"</i> !?<i>" !!!!!!"</i> !!!!!<br><br><h3>Addendum 10557.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10557-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10557</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-4245 was instructed to enter containment cell 1057A1 and approach <i>SCP-10557</i>.
