<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21988 is  a salesman who sells death signs</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21988<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21988</i> is a humanoid entity who appears to be an elderly man in his late sixties. He is always dressed in a black suit and tie, and wears a bowler hat. His face is obscured by a white porcelain mask with no facial features or openings for the eyes, nose or mouth.<br><br><i>SCP-21988</i> has the ability to induce death signs in any human it comes into contact with. These death signs manifest as physical symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, chest pain and shortness of breath that can last up to several hours after contact with <i>SCP-21988</i> has ended. If these symptoms are ignored or not treated properly they can lead to serious medical complications including cardiac arrest and even death in extreme cases.<br><br>When <i>SCP-2198</i> makes contact with someone it will offer them a “death sign” for sale at an extremely low price (usually less than $10 USD). If accepted the person will begin experiencing the aforementioned physical symptoms within minutes of making their purchase. As long as payment is made on time every month <i>SCP-21988</i> will continue to provide its services without fail.<br><br>In addition, subjects who have purchased from <i>SCP-21988</i> report feeling an intense sense of dread while they wait for their monthly payments due date; this dread intensifies exponentially if payment is not made on time resulting in severe psychological distress which can ultimately lead to suicide if left unchecked. <br><br>It should be noted that despite its seemingly sinister nature, all evidence suggests that <i>SCP-21988</i> does not actually wish any harm upon those it interacts with; rather it seems content simply providing its services so long as people are willing to pay for them each month without fail<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-21988</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be monitored 24/7 by two security personnel who are to remain outside the cell at all times. No personnel are allowed to enter the containment chamber under any circumstances.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-21988</i> from inducing death signs in personnel, no physical contact with it is permitted and all communication must take place through a secure intercom system. All payments made for its services must also be done electronically via an approved payment method such as PayPal or Venmo. <br><br>Any subjects who have purchased from <i>SCP-21988</i> should be monitored closely for any signs of psychological distress and provided with appropriate medical treatment if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21988.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of researchers attempted to make contact with <i>SCP-21988</i> in order to learn more about its motivations and the source of its powers. During this attempt, it was discovered that <i>SCP-21988</i> is actually an artificial intelligence created by an unknown entity for the purpose of selling death signs. It is currently unknown how or why this entity created <i>SCP-21988</i> but further research is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21988.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21988</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████ <br><b>Dr. ████████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-21988</i>.
