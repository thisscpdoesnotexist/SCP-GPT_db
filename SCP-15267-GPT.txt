The pages contain writing that appears to be human neural tissue, but the words cannot be read by humans due to the complexity and density of the folds used for each word.<br><br><i>SCP-15267</i>'s anomalous properties activate when it is opened by a human subject at any point during their life cycle (See Addendum 15267-1). Upon activation, <i>SCP-15267</i> will grant selective omnipotence to its reader; this ability can be used on anything except for reality warping or conceptual manipulation (See Addendum 15267-2). Once <i>SCP-15268</i> has been activated, it will remain open until its reader dies or closes it manually; if closed while not being read by anyone within line of sight then it will reopen after approximately 2 hours have passed since its last use (See Experiment Log 15267). If someone other than its intended reader attempts to read from <i>SCP-15268</i> then they will immediately suffer from massive cerebral hemorrhaging followed by death within 5 minutes (See Experiment Log 15267).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15267.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15267</i>'s reader, ███ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted one month after the activation of <i>SCP-15267</i> by ███ ███████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr. █████████ and I will be conducting your monthly interview to see how you are adjusting to your new abilities. Please tell me about any changes you have noticed since last month's interview? ███ <br><br><b>███████: </b>Well I've been getting a lot more done at work and I've been able to fix some problems with my family that have been bugging me for years now, so that's pretty good! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That sounds great! How do you feel about the fact that you can't use your powers on reality warping or conceptual manipulation? Does it bother you at all? ███ <br><br><b>███████: </b>No not really, it doesn't bother me much at all actually; it just means I need to find other ways around those problems instead of just making them go away instantly like before! (laughs) It makes things more interesting anyways; plus if there are people out there who are using their powers on reality warping then they must be doing something wrong because they aren't omnipotent if they're only doing things like that right? (laughs again) <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That is correct sir; now let us continue with our standard physical examination… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject was given Class A amnestic and returned back into society under surveillance until his death in 2026 due to natural causes related to old age (See Addendum 15267-3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15267.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15267-1: </b>D-15267 was instructed to read from <i>SCP-15267</i>. After reading for approximately 4 minutes, D-15267 reported that he was able to control the movements of his hand and fingers at a distance of up to 1 meter away from his body. He was then ordered to close <i>SCP-15267</i> without being told why. After doing so, one of the researchers attempted to open it; however, they were unable to do so and reported feeling a strong resistance preventing them from doing so.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15267-2: </b>D-15268 was instructed by Dr ██████ (who had been informed about <i>SCP-15268</i>'s properties) to read from it while she stood within line of sight of him but outside the range in which he could perceive her movements or speech. After reading for approximately 2 minutes, Dr ██████ began moving around the room while speaking with several other researchers who were also aware of <i>SCP-15268</i>'s properties; upon attempting communication with D-[REDACTED] she found that she could not speak or move her body in any way other than blinking and breathing despite still being conscious and aware of everything happening around her. She remained in this state until death caused by oxygen deprivation 3 hours later (See Addendum 15268).</div>
