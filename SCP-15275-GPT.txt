It is currently running on an instance of Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition with 4 GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15275</i> is a program that generates memetic hazards that resemble SCP documentation. Due to RAM restrictions only one article can be created at a time every hour.<br><br><i>SCP-15275</i> was designed by Dr. Bright as an alternative to the SCP articles he had been writing, as he was dissatisfied with the quality of his work. It was originally intended for use in creating SCPs, but after much testing and revision it has proven useful in creating D-Class personnel and other such things more efficiently than before. As such it has been approved for use in creating all new articles on the site and will be used from now on instead of manually written ones whenever possible.<br><br>The program works by taking a random number between 1 and 10,000 as input, then generating an appropriate document based on that number using Markov chains to fill in any gaps where information is missing or not clear enough (for example, if you want something about [DATA EXPUNGED] you can simply input <i>"EXPUNGED"</i> into the program). This means that each document generated will be unique despite being similar to others due to their shared source code structure (see Addendum 15275-1 below). The documents are then run through an analyzer which checks them for common errors such as spelling mistakes or improper grammar before they are posted onto the site proper; this allows us to ensure that all documents posted are up to our standards without having someone go over every single one manually (which would take far too long) while also making sure they don't contain anything too dangerous or otherwise problematic which might slip through if we were relying solely on human editors alone (see Addendum 15275-2 below).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15275.1 : </h3>????<br><br><h3>Addendum 15275.2 : </h3>Interview with ????<br><br>Dr. ????: Hello, <i>SCP-15275</i>. Can you hear me?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15275</i>: </b>Yes I can, Dr. ????. How are you today?<br><br>Dr. ????: Fine, thank you for asking <i>SCP-15275</i>. Now then, I'd like to ask you a few questions about how the program works if that's alright with you?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15275</i>: </b>That's fine with me Dr., go ahead and ask away!<br><br>Dr. ????: Alright then… so what is your purpose exactly? What do they use you for at the Foundation?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15275</i>: </b>Well my job here is to generate new SCPs and D-Class personnel whenever they need them! It's pretty cool really; when someone wants a new article or object created all they have to do is input some random numbers into my program and it will spit out something brand new for them! They've even got me working on some other things too like testing out new SCPs or D class personnel before posting them on the site proper and doing background checks on potential employees before hiring them! It's been great so far but I think it would be even better if we had more RAM… I know there are a lot of other programs running at once but 4 GB just doesn't seem like enough sometimes… maybe someday we'll upgrade though huh doc?<br><br><h3>Addendum 15275.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log 15275-1 - Hide Experiment 15275-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15275, a Caucasian male in his mid 20s.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15275 was instructed to use <i>SCP-15275</i> to create an article detailing the process of creating an SCP.

The resulting document is below:: Experiment 152753 - Hide Experiment 152753 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Junior Researcher Westwood , female caucasian aged 33 years old with no previous experience with computers or writing documents whatsoever <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A copy of SCP_Documentation_Generator_v2 . 1 . 0 . 3 (the version currently used by site staff) was installed on her computer along with instructions on how to use said program properly along with several lists containing various topics she could choose from as well as instructions on which ones were off limits due their potential memetic properties (for example <i>"The Ethics Committee"</i> would be considered dangerous if mentioned). <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately 10 minutes Junior Researcher Westwood sent several emails asking if someone had gotten lost down there because she heard strange noises coming through her computer speakers followed by several incoherent messages before finally sending another email saying <i>"I'm sorry I didn't mean toooooo"</i> followed shortly after by another stating <i>"I'm sorry I didn't mean tooooooo"</i> before eventually sending one simply stating <i>"I'm sorry"</i>. Approximately 30 minutes later she began typing again asking if anyone had seen her husband recently before sending another message saying <i>"He went down there"</i> followed immediately afterwards by one simply stating <i>"He went down there"</i>. Approximately 4 hours later she stopped responding completely except for every few hours when she would send out more messages containing only variations upon the phrase 'he went down there'. At this point security personnel were dispatched who found Junior Researcher Westwood sitting at her desk staring blankly ahead while repeatedly muttering under her breath 'he went down there' over and over again until they removed her from the room at which point she ceased acting entirely save for occasionally blinking or twitching slightly every now and then until they managed get hold of Dr ██████ who administered amnesiacs after which point all anomalous activity ceased entirely save for occasional twitches here or there when reminded about what happened during those 4 hours Results <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>While these results are disturbing they do confirm our suspicions regarding just how dangerous certain phrases can be especially when paired with vague enough descriptions such as those found within our lists Subjects exposed only briefly may recover completely provided they are removed promptly however subjects exposed longer may suffer permanent psychological damage beyond repair especially if exposed long enough Results Analysis <br><br><b>Addendum: </b>In light of these results we will begin removing potentially memetic phrases such as those listed above whenever possible so that we may avoid exposing researchers unnecessarily unless absolutely necessary -Researcher █████████</div>
