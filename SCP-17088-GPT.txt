It is slowly approaching Earth and is projected to arrive within twenty years. It  constantly emits anomalous signals with harmful properties.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17088</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3><br><br><i>SCP-17088</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation satellites and other long-range observation equipment. Any changes in its trajectory or behavior are to be reported immediately.<br><br>A perimeter of unmanned probes has been established around <i>SCP-17088</i>, with the purpose of monitoring its approach towards Earth and providing early warning should it deviate from its current course.<br><br>In order to minimize the effects of <i>SCP-17088</i>' anomalous signals, personnel assigned to monitor it must wear protective gear at all times while within range. Personnel must also take regular breaks from their duties in order to avoid prolonged exposure.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17088</i> is a large, spherical object resembling an eye, approximately the size of Jupiter. It is located beyond the orbit of Neptune in the outer reaches of our solar system and is slowly approaching Earth at a rate of 0.25 AU/year.<br><br>The surface of <i>SCP-17088</i> appears to be composed mostly of ice and dust particles, with occasional patches that appear to be composed of organic matter or rock. The interior appears to contain some form of liquid or gas, though its exact composition has yet to be determined.<br><br><i>SCP-17088</i> constantly emits anomalous signals which have been found to cause various harmful effects upon <br><br><b>exposure: </b>physical pain, nausea, dizziness, disorientation and memory loss among others. The intensity and range of these effects vary depending on proximity; those closest to <i>SCP-17088</i> experience more severe symptoms than those further away from it.<br><br>Attempts at communication with <i>SCP-17088</i> have thus far been unsuccessful; however it has been observed that when exposed to certain types of audio frequencies (such as music) the emitted signals will change frequency in response before reverting back shortly afterwards.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17088.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17088</i> abruptly changed its trajectory and began to accelerate towards Earth. Its current estimated arrival date is ██/██/20██. Further attempts at communication with <i>SCP-17088</i> have been unsuccessful thus far.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17088.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation research team conducted an interview with Dr. ████████, a professor at the University of █████████ who has been studying <i>SCP-17088</i> for several years. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>It's… hard to explain what I've seen. At first it was just this… eye in space that seemed to be watching us from afar. But then it started moving closer and emitting these strange signals… It almost feels like it's trying to communicate with us, but we can't understand what it's saying.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17088.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/20██ - A test was conducted in which a Foundation-made probe was sent to the vicinity of <i>SCP-17088</i>. The probe was equipped with various audio speakers playing a variety of music, ranging from classical to modern. Upon entering <i>SCP-17088</i>' vicinity, the emitted signals changed frequency and intensity in response to each song played by the speakers. After approximately one hour, the probe was recalled and all data collected during this experiment has been analyzed for further study.</div>
