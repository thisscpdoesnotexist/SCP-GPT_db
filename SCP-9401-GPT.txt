The base of the model reads <i>"Made in China"</i>. When <i>SCP-9401</i> comes within 50 centimeters of any person, they will begin to feel very hot and attempt to move away from it. If <i>SCP-9401</i> comes into direct contact with the subject, they will begin sweating profusely and complain of feeling nauseous before collapsing and dying within 3 minutes. Autopsies have revealed that all bodily fluids have been evaporated by an unknown process during this time period.<br><br>This effect only occurs if the subject has sustained at least 10% body burns or other severe injuries as a result from their exposure to <i>SCP-9401</i> . Otherwise, no anomalous effects occur when exposed to it for longer than 10 minutes at a distance greater than 0 meters.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> A family of three was found dead in their apartment in Beijing, China. The cause of death was determined to be exposure to <i>SCP-9401</i> , and the Foundation recovered the object.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9401.1 :</h3> Testing Log<br><br>Testing conducted by Dr. █████ and D-Class personnel at Site-███.

Under the supervision of research assistant D - 8788 and armed with a blowtorch, he placed it on a table at 0 meters away from him. He then proceeded to cut off his left hand with the blowtorch and place it next to <i>SCP-9401</i> . He then signaled for D - 8788 to continue moving the object toward him while waving off any questions they had about his sudden action. After 5 minutes, Dr. █████ fell unconscious due to blood loss before passing away 5 seconds later after exposure to <i>SCP-9401</i> . The cause of death was determined by autopsy again due to evaporated internal fluids</div>
