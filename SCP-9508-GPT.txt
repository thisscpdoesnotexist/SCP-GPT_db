At the beginning of each month, <i>SCP-9508</i> will begin its cycle. During this time of the month, no personnel are allowed to enter or exit <i>SCP-9508</i>'s containment chamber.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9508</i> is a set of stairs in the shape of a helical staircase. The staircase has been measured to contain approximately 17,000 steps. Each step is 7 centimeters high and 10 centimeters wide.<br><br>When <i>SCP-9508</i> begins its cycle, the staircase will disappear, leaving only an empty floor where the staircase was located. The walls of the containment chamber will begin to emit a bright blue light which emanates from cracks on the walls and floor. There are no apparent sources for this light, as it does not seem to come from any external source or from inside <i>SCP-9508</i> itself . All attempts at capturing or tracing this light have failed; however it can be seen through solid objects as if it were normal light. After 2 hours have passed, <i>SCP-9508</i> reappears in its original location with all stairs intact and fully functional (see Addendum 950x-2) .<br><br><i>SCP-9508</i> was discovered when reports of a glowing staircase leading up into thin air began reaching local law enforcement agencies in ██████████ , Washington state . These reports went ignored by Foundation personnel until law enforcement officers attempted to enter <i>SCP-9508</i>'s containment chamber while active during testing performed by Agent ████████ (see Addendum 950x). Due to [DATA EXPUNGED] , Site 54 was put on lockdown and an investigation into these events were conducted by Drs' ███████ & ███████ & Research Assistant ████████ (See Addendum 950x for full details)<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9508</i> was found in a ████████ department store, located in the basement of the building. The staircase was covered by a plastic tarp and appeared to be in an early stage of construction. The staircase itself had no visible signs of tampering and the location it was found it is believed that <i>SCP-9508</i> had been installed into the building during its creation.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9508.1 :</h3> Interview Log 9508-1<br><br><br>Interviewed: Agent ████████<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. ███████<br><br><Begin Log><br><br>Dr.<br> ███████: Alright, please state your name and position with the Foundation.<br><br>Agent ████████ expelled air from his mouth in a manner similar to someone clearing their throat before speaking.<br><br><br>Agent ████████: Uh, yeah… My name is Agent Jeffery James and I'm a Level 1 researcher for the SCP foundation… Uh.. [Pauses] Why am I here? I don't understand what's going on! You said that this was just an interview but you've locked me up in here like some kind of prisoner! What did I do wrong?<br><br>Dr. ███████ places his hand on Agent James' shoulder to calm him down before speaking again.<br><br>Dr.<br> ███████: Please relax agent; we're not keeping you locked away because of anything you did wrong or anything like that at all actually, it's just standard protocol when something [Pauses] happens or crashes into our world that we need to keep tabs of everything around us for containment purposes so if something does happen we can figure out how to deal with it accordingly… Now back to my questions, can you tell me what happened after you climbed up the staircase into thin air? Did anything else unusual happen during this time period? Did anyone else fall up the staircase with you or did any other objects follow after your ascent? Can you describe these things for me at all please? Doesn't have to be much detail but any information will help us out greatly thank you very much! <End Log><br> Closing Statement: After being supplied with food and water (see Addendum 950x-1) , Agent James stated that he would be willing to answer more questions regarding <i>SCP-9508</i> under better circumstances; however Drs' ҉҉҉nbsp<br><br><h3>Addendum 9508.2 :</h3> Addendum 950x<br><br><i>SCP-9508</i> was brought to Site 54 for testing purposes by Agent ████████. A small camera and microphone were placed inside the containment chamber at the base of <i>SCP-9508</i> to monitor the events that took place during testing.<br> The following is a transcript of all recorded activity:<br><br><Begin Log> Agent ████████ is seen climbing up <i>SCP-9508</i> while holding a microphone in one hand and pressing down with his foot on each step as he ascends. At 1 hour 54 minutes into the test, Agent ████████ stops moving up <i>SCP-9508</i>, turns around and begins speaking into his microphone.<br><br><br>Agent ████████: Alright so I'm standing still here on what appears to be about halfway up this thing… It's been about an hour and nothing has happened yet except for me getting really dizzy from all this spinning around… [Pauses] Oh yeah! I almost forgot about my phone! Let me just check it real quick before we lose cell service… [Pauses] Alright there's no service here, but it looks like we've got plenty of time left over if anyone else wants to join us as long as they get here before 10 hours have passed since start time… Just trying to help out everyone who works with Drs' ҉҉҉nbsp too much paperwork on my desk atm and could use a little break from all that stuff you know?
