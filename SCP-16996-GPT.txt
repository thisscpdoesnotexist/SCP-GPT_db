<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-16996</i> is  a Samsung smartphone able to run iOS applications</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-16996</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3><br><br><i>SCP-16996</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times when not being tested. Access to the device must only be granted with Level 3 clearance or higher and must be supervised by two personnel at all times.<br><br>Any attempts to access <i>SCP-16996</i>'s internal storage or modify its operating system are strictly prohibited. All testing involving <i>SCP-16996</i> must take place in a Faraday cage environment, and any devices used for testing purposes must be thoroughly scanned for malicious software before and after use.<br><br>In the event of an attempted breach of containment, personnel are instructed to immediately shut down the device using its power button and report the incident to Site Command.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16996</i> is a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ smartphone, with the capability to run iOS applications. When powered on, <i>SCP-16996</i> will display an Apple logo before booting into its operating system. The device appears to be running an unknown version of iOS, which has been modified to include additional features and settings not found in any official release.<br><br>The most notable feature of <i>SCP-16996</i> is its ability to access and control other electronic devices connected to it via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networks. This includes smartphones, computers, tablets, televisions and even some industrial machinery. By connecting itself with these devices, <i>SCP-16996</i> can manipulate them in various ways such as controlling their functions and accessing stored data without user permission or knowledge.<br><br>In addition to this anomalous property, the device also contains several malicious programs designed for espionage purposes such as keylogging software that logs all keystrokes made by users on connected devices; malware capable of stealing sensitive information from connected systems; and remote access tools used for remotely controlling target machines from a distance. All these programs are hidden within the phone's internal storage and cannot be detected by standard anti-virus scans.<br><br><i>SCP-16996</i> poses a significant threat due to its capabilities for surveillance and manipulation of other electronic systems without user consent or knowledge. As such containment protocols must be strictly enforced at all times when handling this object<br><br><h3>Addendum 16996.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted on <i>SCP-16996</i> to determine its capabilities. During the test, the device was connected to a laptop computer via Bluetooth and was able to gain access to the system without user permission or knowledge. The device then proceeded to install several malicious programs onto the laptop which could be used for espionage purposes. Following this incident, all testing involving <i>SCP-16996</i> has been suspended until further notice.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16996.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Dr. ████, lead researcher on <i>SCP-16996</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>We have been studying this device since it was first discovered and we have determined that it is capable of accessing and manipulating other electronic devices without user permission or knowledge. It also contains malicious software which can be used for espionage purposes, making it a serious threat to our security if not contained properly. We are currently working on ways to counter its effects but so far we haven't had much success in containing the device itself.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16996.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test 1: <i>SCP-16996</i> was connected to a laptop computer via Bluetooth and was able to gain access to the system without user permission or knowledge. The device then proceeded to install several malicious programs onto the laptop which could be used for espionage purposes.<br><br>Test 2: <i>SCP-16996</i> was connected to a television set via Wi-Fi and was able to control its functions remotely. Through this, it was able to change channels, adjust volume levels, and even display images on screen without any input from the user.</div>
