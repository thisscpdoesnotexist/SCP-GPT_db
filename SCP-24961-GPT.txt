<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24961 is  a Scranton Reality Anchor bracelet</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24961<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Thaumiel<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24961</i> is a bracelet made of an unknown metal alloy, with a circular faceplate on the front and two small buttons on either side. When worn by a human subject, it will cause a localized reality distortion field to manifest around the subject, which can be used to stabilize or alter reality within its area of effect.<br><br>The size of this field can be adjusted by pressing either button on the device; pressing one increases the radius while pressing the other decreases it. The maximum radius appears to be approximately 10km (6 miles).<br><br>When activated, any anomalous phenomena or events occurring within this area will become stabilized and remain in their current state until deactivated. This includes both natural and artificial phenomena such as weather patterns, gravity fields, space-time distortions, temporal anomalies etc. It also has been shown to suppress certain types of cognitohazards such as memetic agents and infohazards when active.<br><br>In addition to stabilizing existing anomalies, <i>SCP-24961</i> also has been observed creating new ones when activated for extended periods of time; these effects are generally localized but may have far reaching consequences depending on their nature. To date none have been observed that are particularly dangerous or hazardous in nature however further testing is ongoing in order to ensure that no potentially harmful effects occur due to its use.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24961</i> is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-██. Access to the device is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and any testing involving its use must be approved by the O5 Council.<br><br>Any personnel wearing <i>SCP-24961</i> are to be monitored for any anomalous effects that may occur due to its usage, and must remain within a 10km radius of the device at all times while it is active. If any potentially dangerous anomalies are observed they are to be reported immediately and dealt with accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24961.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-24961</i> was used to stabilize a temporal anomaly in [REDACTED], which had been causing the entire city to experience random time jumps. After being stabilized by the device, all affected individuals returned to their proper times and no further anomalies have occurred since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24961.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. ████████, Head Researcher of <i>SCP-24961</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> O5-██<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Dr. ████████ was interviewed in order to gain a better understanding of the device and its effects.<br><br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><br>O5-██:</b> So Doctor, can you tell us a bit more about this device? What is its purpose?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Well, it's primarily designed to stabilize reality in a localized area. It does this by creating a field of energy around the wearer that suppresses any anomalous phenomena or events occurring within its range. This includes both natural and artificial phenomena such as weather patterns, gravity fields, space-time distortions and temporal anomalies etc. It also has been shown to suppress certain types of cognitohazards such as memetic agents and infohazards when active.<br><b><br>O5-██:</b> Interesting. And what are the possible applications of this device?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Well, it could be used to contain or even neutralize dangerous anomalies in a localized area, as well as prevent the spread of anomalous effects such as cognitohazards or infohazards. It could also be used to stabilize existing anomalies and prevent them from becoming more chaotic or dangerous over time. Finally, it has potential uses in research and exploration; by stabilizing an area researchers can study anomalous phenomena without fear of interference from outside sources.<br><b><br>O5-██:</b> I see. Thank you Doctor, that will be all.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 24961.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> <i>SCP-24961</i> was activated and left in a rural area near Site-██. After one hour of continuous use, a localized gravity field was observed within the radius of effect, causing objects to float in midair and remain suspended until the device was deactivated. No other anomalous effects were observed during this time.<br><b><br>Experiment #2:</b> <i>SCP-24961</i> was activated and left in an urban area near Site-██. After two hours of continuous use, a localized temporal anomaly manifested within its radius of effect; time appeared to move slower than normal within this area, with some objects appearing to move at half their normal speed or less when viewed from outside its boundary. The anomaly dissipated after the device was deactivated.</div>
