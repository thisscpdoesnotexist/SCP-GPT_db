After testing confirmed that the item did indeed turn humans into chocolate bars they contained all instances using standard methods for containing anomalous objects and then proceeded to destroy all instances before anyone else could consume them.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15356.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, who was turned into an instance of <i>SCP-15356</i>-1<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>█████ ███████ <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>█████ ███████ <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, could you please tell me your name?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15356</i>-1: </b>My name is (pause) I'm sorry but I don't know what my name is anymore…<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's alright, we'll find out what it is soon enough.
