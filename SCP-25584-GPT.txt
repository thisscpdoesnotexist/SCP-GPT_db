Players will begin to experience symptoms of paranoia and distrust towards one another as they attempt to complete their objectives. This effect increases in severity as more players join the lobby, eventually leading them into full-blown panic and hysteria as they struggle to determine who among them may be an imposter sabotaging their efforts.<br><br>Attempts at containing <i>SCP-25584</i> have been unsuccessful due to its widespread popularity throughout various gaming communities worldwide, with over 200 million registered users across all platforms since its release date in 2018. As such, containment measures have shifted towards mitigating the effects of playing this game on affected individuals instead of attempting further containment procedures that would likely prove ineffective or counterintuitive given current circumstances.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>1. All personnel assigned to <i>SCP-25584</i> are to be monitored for signs of paranoia or distrust towards their fellow crewmates while playing the game. Any such cases should be reported immediately and appropriate measures taken to ensure that affected personnel receive proper psychological care.<br><br>2. Educational campaigns are to be conducted in order to raise awareness about the potential effects of playing <i>SCP-25584</i> on individuals, particularly those who may already suffer from anxiety or other mental health issues that could be exacerbated by this game's anomalous properties.<br><br>3. Research is ongoing into methods of preventing or reducing the effects of <i>SCP-25584</i> on players, including but not limited to developing countermeasures against its anomalous properties and creating alternate versions of the game with<br><br><h3> Addendum 25584.1: </h3><br><br>On August 7th, 2020, a new version of <i>SCP-25584</i> was released with several changes to its gameplay mechanics. These changes included the introduction of a new <i>"suspicion meter"</i> which tracks the level of suspicion between players in an online lobby and can be used to identify potential imposters more easily. Additionally, there are now multiple roles that players can choose from when joining a game; these include the traditional crewmate role as well as two additional roles: <i>"The Imposter"</i> and <i>"The Skeptic"</i>. The latter two roles allow for increased player interaction and cooperation during matches in order to better identify any potential imposters among them.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25584.2: </h3> Interview with Innersloth LLC<br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation agent posing as an independent game developer interviewed the lead designer of <i>SCP-25584</i>, Mr. ████████. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> So, tell me about this game you've developed. What was your inspiration for it?<br><b><br>Mr. ████████:</b> Well, I wanted to create something that would be a fun and exciting experience for players online. I was inspired by the classic game of 'Mafia' and thought it would be interesting to make an online version of it where players could cooperate with each other to complete tasks while also trying to figure out who among them is the imposter sabotaging their efforts.<br><b><br>Agent:</b> Interesting. And what made you decide to include the anomalous properties in your game?<br><b><br>Mr. ████████:</b> To be honest, I didn't really think too much about it at first - it just seemed like a natural fit for the type of game I was creating. But as development continued, I started to notice that players were becoming more and more paranoid and distrustful of each other, even when they had no reason to be. It was then that I realized the effects of this game could be much greater than I initially anticipated.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25584.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><br>A series of experiments were conducted in order to determine the effects of <i>SCP-25584</i> on players. The results are as follows:<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> Three (3) D-Class personnel were instructed to play a game of <i>SCP-25584</i>, with one (1) designated as an imposter. After approximately fifteen (15) minutes, all three D-Class personnel began exhibiting signs of paranoia and distrust towards one another, eventually leading to physical altercations between two (2) of them. The third D-Class was able to identify the imposter before any further damage could be done.</div>
