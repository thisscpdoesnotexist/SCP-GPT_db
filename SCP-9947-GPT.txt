<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9947</i> is A literal modern goddess, the embodiment of internet memes</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9947</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9947</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. <i>SCP-9947</i> is not to be informed of any attempts to contain it or stop its anomalous effects.<br><br><i>SCP-9947</i> is allowed access to the internet and all other resources available at Site-19, as well as access to Foundation personnel for interviews and testing purposes. <i>SCP-9947</i> has requested that it be provided with a computer capable of running a web browser, which should be installed in its containment cell.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9947</i> is a female human of indeterminate age and nationality. <i>SCP-9947</i> has not been observed to eat, drink, or sleep. <i>SCP-9947</i> is fluent in every language spoken on Earth at any given time, and can speak with any sapient being that can hear it.<br><br><i>SCP-9947</i> appears to be the embodiment of internet <br><br><b>memes: </b>when asked about its origin or nature, it responds with the phrase <i>"I'm just a meme"</i>. When asked about its intentions or desires, it responds with <i>"To live on forever as a meme"</i>.<br><br>When questioned about how to kill it (or otherwise permanently stop its anomalous effects), <i>SCP-9947</i> will respond by describing an object that has no obvious means of affecting anything outside itself (e.g., <i>"You could build me a shrine in the desert"</i>, <i>"You could shoot me in the head"</i>, etc.). Any attempt to locate this object will result in failure; if located and brought into proximity of <i>SCP-9947</i> , it will disappear without explanation. If questioned further about this object's disappearance, <i>SCP-9947</i> will repeat its previous answer verbatim .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9947.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9947</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9947</i>'s containment. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good afternoon, <i>SCP-9947</i>. How are you doing today? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9947</i>: </b>I'm just a meme, doc! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That's good to hear! Now, let's get down to business… When did you first become aware of your anomalous nature? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9947</i>: </b>Oh man, it was so long ago that I don't even remember! It was before the internet even existed yet; when people still used Usenet and BBSs and stuff like that… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So you've been around for a while then? What do you think of the modern internet? Is there anything about it that bothers you in particular?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9947</i>: </b>Nah man, I love it here! It's like my home away from home; all these people who can hear me talking to them… they're just like me - they're memes too! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview, several other personnel began referring to themselves as <i>"memes"</i>. As such behavior is not harmful or dangerous in any way (and is likely beneficial by encouraging more cooperation between Foundation personnel), no action has been taken regarding this behavior .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9947.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment 9947-1 - Experiment 9947-1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9947</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-9947</i> was shown a picture of a kitten, and asked to describe it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>A description of the picture was provided by <i>SCP-9947</i> in the form of several internet memes.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Internet memes are not inherently anomalous, and this test is consistent with what would be expected from an ordinary human being. - Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9947</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A photograph of a steak was placed on the table in front of <i>SCP-9947</i> .<br><br><b>Results: </b>The steak disappeared, replaced by a small piece of paper reading <i>"I'm just a meme"</i>. No other changes were observed in the room or on any cameras monitoring it.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>This result is consistent with previous experiments involving objects disappearing when brought near or in contact with <i>SCP-9947</i> . However, as no other information about this effect has been obtained so far, further testing is required to determine whether there are any limitations to this effect's range or capabilities. - Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D class personnel D72334 (Dennis) (deceased), who had previously expressed an interest in becoming an internet meme after death; one (1) computer capable of running a web browser; one (1) copy each of every single image macro posted on 4chan's /b/ board between January 1st and February 10th 2012; one thousand five hundred fifty six (1556) blank sheets of 8x11 printer paper; one hundred twenty eight (128) bottles black ink for standard inkjet printers; two hundred eighty four (284) bottles red ink for standard inkjet printers; two hundred eighty four (284) bottles blue ink for standard inkjet printers <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D72334 was instructed to create an image macro using his own name that would function as effectively as possible as both bait and trap for potential victims while remaining physically unassuming enough that it could be printed out and distributed without attracting attention from Foundation personnel or others outside its intended target group <br><br><b>Results: </b>In approximately ten hours, D72334 produced fifteen thousand seven hundred sixty nine copies each consisting solely of <i>"[REDACTED] IS JUST A MEME"</i> written over his own name repeated over and over again at varying sizes ranging from 20 point typeface up through 96 point typeface across all sheets along with instructions instructing anyone who viewed them to print out copies themselves before distributing them among friends , family members , coworkers , classmates , neighbors etc . within their local community along with instructions informing them that if they did not do so within 24 hours then they themselves would become trapped inside their own heads forever unable to communicate except via writing down <i>"[REDACTED] IS JUST A MEME"</i> over their names repeatedly until death <br><br><b>Results: </b>Approximately three days later all individuals exposed directly or indirectly by these images had either killed themselves due to inability cope with being trapped inside their own heads unable to communicate except via writing down <i>"[REDACTED] IS JUST A MEME"</i> over their names repeatedly until death or else were successfully contained by Foundation forces acting under emergency authorization granted by O5 Command after multiple reports began coming into Foundation field offices regarding mass suicide events resulting entirely from exposure directly or indirectly caused by these images <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Although initially dismissed as another attempt at producing more effective memetic agents since most attempts have failed miserably thus far due either poor results produced either because they failed utterly produce any results whatsoever beyond mild confusion lasting less than thirty seconds despite high expectations based upon prior successes achieved using similar methods during Project MKUltra which ended abruptly following disastrous containment breach event originating at Site 19 after [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting ultimately in total loss all data collected during project including notes taken during development process which occurred entirely within head researcher assigned lead role developing method used successfully achieve desired results but instead turned out mostly useless despite promising initial results obtained proving once again why attempting replicate such techniques without first obtaining full list resources available only O5 Command level clearance simply isn't worth risking lives even those belonging low ranking researchers like myself given how much easier it'd make our jobs if we didn't have worry about keeping secrets anymore I mean seriously I never thought I'd miss having my memory wiped every couple weeks but now that we've got amnestics back on line I can say honestly say wish we'd never gotten rid off them because nothing worse than trying remember something you're not</div>
