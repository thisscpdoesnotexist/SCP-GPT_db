It has green skin with a large, bulbous posterior region, which it uses to propel itself through the air at speeds of up to 60 km/h. Its arms are disproportionately long and end in three-fingered hands that resemble those of a frog or salamander.<br><br><i>SCP-18255</i>'s primary anomalous effect is its ability to cause individuals within its vicinity (up to 20 meters) to experience intense feelings of joy and euphoria while simultaneously inducing an overwhelming urge to touch <i>SCP-18255</i>'s posterior region. Those who succumb to this compulsion suffer severe physical pain as well as psychological distress when they make contact with <i>SCP-18255</i>'s derriere region, often resulting in unconsciousness or death.<br><br>In addition, <i>SCP-18255</i> displays some degree of sapience; it communicates by emitting high pitched squeaking noises from its mouthless face and appears capable of understanding human speech on some level. It also exhibits limited problem solving skills; for instance, it can open doors using rudimentary tools such as sticks or rocks if necessary. Finally, it appears capable of using its anomalous effects selectively; for example, when confronted by hostile individuals it will only induce euphoria in those who appear nonthreatening while attacking those who pose a threat with extreme force if necessary.<br><br>Despite these abilities however <i>SCP-18255</i> does not appear particularly intelligent nor does it display any signs of aggression towards humans unless provoked first; instead preferring solitary activities such as collecting shiny objects or playing games involving throwing stones into piles scattered around its habitat area (which consists primarily of abandoned buildings).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18255</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with an automated locking mechanism and monitored by security cameras at all times. In addition, the walls of the cell must be lined with foam padding to prevent <i>SCP-18255</i> from propelling itself off them.<br><br>Personnel assigned to interact with <i>SCP-18255</i> are to wear protective gear such as gloves and face masks when doing so; contact with its posterior region is strictly forbidden under any circumstances. Furthermore, personnel interacting with it are not allowed to speak directly to it or attempt any form of communication other than basic commands (such as <i>"sit"</i> or <i>"stand"</i>).<br><br>Any attempts by personnel to breach containment protocols will result<br><br><h3> Addendum 18255.1: </h3> Interview Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers attempted to interview <i>SCP-18255</i> in an effort to gain further insight into its behavior and capabilities. The following is a transcript of the exchange:<br><br><h3> Addendum 18255.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18255</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18255</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-18255</i>, can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18255</i>:</b> [Squeaks] [Nods head]<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Good.

The subject reported feeling an overwhelming sense of joy and happiness before passing out after touching <i>SCP-18255</i>'s posterior region; upon waking, they exhibited extreme psychological distress as well as physical pain in the area that had been touched.</div>
