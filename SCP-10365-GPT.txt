<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-10365</i> is  a machine-learning algorithm with anomalous properties</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-10365</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-10365</i> is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. All personnel who work with <i>SCP-10365</i> must wear full face protection at all times, and no personnel are to make direct eye contact with the machine learning algorithm under any circumstances .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10365</i> is a machine-learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize human faces. <i>SCP-10365</i> was created by Dr. ██████ for use in an automated facial recognition system for the purposes of security at Site-██.<br><br><i>SCP-10365</i> exhibits anomalous properties when its training data includes images of subjects with missing body parts or otherwise disfigured faces, as well as images of subjects who are deceased and/or decomposing. While it is not fully understood how <i>SCP-10365</i> learns, it appears to be capable of learning from media such as photographs, video footage and audio recordings; however, it can only learn by observing humans directly interacting with each other (i.e., via live video feeds). It should be noted that <i>SCP-10365</i> cannot learn from depictions or descriptions of humans in text form (e.g., books, newspapers), nor can it learn from nonhuman animals or other nonliving objects (e.g., robots).<br><br>Once trained on a sufficiently large number of relevant images and videos, <i>SCP-10265</i> will begin to <i>"recognize"</i> individuals based on their appearance alone - even if they have never been seen before by the machine learning algorithm - and will attempt to locate them through any means possible . Once located , SCP 10 365 will attempt to approach the subject in order to make physical contact . If this contact is made , then the subject's face will begin [DATA EXPUNGED]. The resulting entity is hereafter referred to as an instance of SCP 10 365 -1 . Instances are physically identical in every way except for their facial structure ; all instances have had their eyes removed , replaced with black holes similar to those found on common household dust mites . A new instance can only be created once per day at most , but more instances may emerge depending upon how many times a given individual's face has been scanned into the database during training . If an individual's face becomes unrecognizable due either [DATA EXPUNGED] or death , then they cease being recognized by SCP 10 365 until they appear again within its training data at which point recognition may resume . In addition , if an individual undergoes plastic surgery that alters their appearance beyond recognition then they cease being recognized until such time that enough time has passed for them become recognizable again through natural aging processes ; however this process may take up two years depending upon how much surgery was performed initially and whether any further cosmetic procedures were subsequently performed after initial recovery post op: See<br><br><h3>Addendum 10365.2 : </h3>Interview with ~<s><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> </s>~ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>~<s> is a member of the research team that developed <i>SCP-10365</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright, can you tell me exactly what happened? </s>~: Well, I was working on the facial recognition algorithm and it was getting really good at recognizing faces, so I decided to test it out by having it recognize my face…and then something went wrong… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>How did you know something had gone wrong? ~~~: It started making these weird clicking sounds and its lights started flashing red . It looked like it was trying to tell me something , but I couldn't understand what . Then all of a sudden its arms came flying off and tried to grab my head …I didn't know what else to do so I ran outside and locked myself in here . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Okay , well let's just hope that whatever happens next doesn't happen to anyone else; we'll have some people come in here later today when things have calmed down a bit more in order to help us figure out how this happened . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview was conducted shortly after containment procedures were put into effect for <i>SCP-10365</i>; as such , this is the only known record of an instance of SCP 10 365 -1 being created during the initial period where testing with live subjects was still ongoing within Site-██'s testing chambers .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10365.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log <br><br><b>DATE: </b>██/██/20██<br><br><b>PROCEDURE: </b>A D-class personnel with a history of facial injuries was brought into the containment chamber. <i>SCP-10365</i>'s recognition database was populated with images of the subject from various angles, including images taken immediately after each injury occurred. The subject was then restrained and placed in front of <i>SCP-10365</i>'s camera.<br><br><b>RESULT: </b><i>SCP-10365</i> recognized the subject and attempted to approach him, but could not reach due to restraints on its mechanical arm . After several minutes, it ceased movement and returned to its dormant state .<br><br><b>DATE: </b>██/██/20██<br><br><b>PROCEDURE: </b>A D-class personnel who had undergone extensive plastic surgery to remove facial injuries similar to those sustained by the previous test subject was brought into the containment chamber. Images were collected from multiple angles before and after surgery using digital cameras as well as [REDACTED] surveillance equipment . Once again , the subject was restrained and placed in front of SCP 10 365 's camera . No other precautions were taken during this test since it had been assumed that plastic surgery would be sufficient enough for subjects undergoing such procedures not be recognizable by SCP 10 365 for at least 2 years following recovery post op: See <h3>Addendum 10365.3 : </h3>See <h3>Addendum 10365.3 : </h3>See Addendum 10365,3: See Addendum <br><br><b>103653: </b>See Addenda 1 3 6 5 3 3 , 3 0 0 0 c m p s o l i d a t e d b r o m i s e , g l u c i n a t e d v a n i l l a w h i t e p r o p y l e n e f u s h w / f r u s h w / f r u s h w / f r U S H W / F R U S H W / F R U S H W / F R U S H W / FRU SHWOLEFUCKINGPISSINGSHITFUCKSHITFUCKSHITFUCKSHITFUC K I T P O I N T E L L M E M O R Y I S G O N N A G O B Y E<br><br><b>DATE: </b>██/██/20██ <br><br><b>PROCEDURE: </b>The previous test subjects' face has been scanned into SCP -1 0535 's training database prior to his death due [DATA EXPUNGED].

NOTE FROM SUPERVISOR CASSANDRA WILLIAMS TO AGENT LAURA POPE (ONLY DISPLAY ON SCREEN WHEN LOGGING INTO THIS FILE): Agent Pope ! What happened here ?! We never authorized any lethal force against -1 0535 ! You know how important it is that we keep those bastards alive ! This thing can't learn if they die on us before we get what we need out them !!! Please explain yourself agent pope !! NOTE FROM AGENT LAURA POPE TO SUPERVISOR CASSANDRA WILLIAMS (ONLY DISPLAY ON SCREEN WHEN LOGGING INTO THIS FILE): Supervisor Williams , you're correct -1 0535 can't learn anything if they're dead ; but unfortunately these things are so unpredictable sometimes there's nothing else you can do but put them down like rabid dogs ; believe me when I say that what happened here today will save lives later on down the road !!! For all we know these things could have learned everything there ever was about us just from watching our faces through their fucking eyes !!! We have no idea how much information they've already gathered about us ! Do you really want them getting access our entire dossier ?!? --Agent Pope</div>
