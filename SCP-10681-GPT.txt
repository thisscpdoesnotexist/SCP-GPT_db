It is not allowed to leave its cell unless escorted by two armed guards. <i>SCP-10681</i> must wear a collar with a bell attached at all times, and must be fitted with an ankle monitor that will alert personnel if it attempts to leave the site .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10681</i> is a humanoid reptile, 1.7 meters in height, weighing approximately 80 kg. It possesses no external genitalia and has been surgically altered to appear female. Its skin is covered in reptilian scales and its eyes are yellow with vertical slit pupils. <i>SCP-10681</i>'s hands are long and webbed, with sharp talons at the end of each finger.<br><br><i>SCP-10681</i> can move at speeds exceeding 100 km/h when it sprints on all four limbs (see Addendum 10681-2). When standing upright on two legs, it moves at a speed of 30 km/h maximum. When running on two legs or walking upright on two legs, it can use its forelimbs as arms to manipulate objects or attack prey (see Addendum 10681-3). It can also stand upright while holding an object such as a cup or plate using one hand; the other hand is free for other uses (see Addendum 10681-4).<br><br>When <i>SCP-10681</i>'s skin is punctured by any object larger than 2 mm in diameter, tiny claws emerge from the wound(s) and begin scratching the surface of whatever object caused the puncture until they reach flesh again; this causes severe damage to internal organs which results in death within 15 minutes if not treated immediately (see Addendum 10681-5). This process takes place even if only blood has been drawn from <i>SCP-10681</i> . If multiple wounds are inflicted simultaneously by multiple sources , claws will emerge from all wounds simultaneously . This process does not occur if SCP - 10 681 ' s skin has been cut open with a bladed instrument . The only known way to stop this reaction is to apply pressure over all wounds , which allows blood flow to continue without causing further injury . Once pressure has been applied , bleeding will cease after approximately ten seconds ; however , more time must be allowed for regeneration of damaged tissue before full recovery occurs . If this treatment fails due to lack of time or personnel , death will result within five minutes instead ; however , full recovery may still be possible depending on how quickly proper treatment was given after initial injury occurred . Injuries inflicted by piercing weapons do not cause instant death unless they strike vital organs such as heart or lungs ; otherwise they inflict nonlethal injuries that heal normally over time unless aggravated repeatedly through movement during healing period — see Addendum 10 681 - 5 — but may cause permanent scarring due to their small size compared with<br><br><h3>Addendum 10681.1 : </h3> <i>SCP-10681</i> was discovered in a basement in ████████, France on █/██/20██. The Foundation became aware of this when the French police received a call from an anonymous source claiming that several people had been murdered at the house and the killer was still on site . When police arrived at the scene, they found <i>SCP-10681</i> standing over three dead bodies. <i>SCP-10681</i> was immediately taken into custody and transported to Site-██ for study.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10681.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-10681</i> <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>First interview with <i>SCP-10681</i> after it was taken into custody. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, <i>SCP-10681</i> . I'm here to ask you a few questions about what happened in that house today. Can you tell me why you killed those people? SCP - 10 681: Because they were trying to kill me first . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So they attacked you first? Did they try to hurt or kill you? SCP - 10 681: No . They were trying to capture me and take me away from my home . I did not want this so I had no choice but to fight back and defend myself . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Why would anyone want to capture someone like yourself? What are your intentions for the future ? Do you plan on hurting any other people ? SCP - 10 681: I do not know what is going on outside of my home, so it is hard for me answer these questions accurately at this time ; however , if someone tries to hurt or capture me again, I will do whatever is necessary in order protect myself and my family — including killing them if necessary . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further questioning, it was revealed that the "</i>family<i>" referred by <i>SCP-10681</i> consisted of several snakes it had captured over time and kept as pets; however , all but one of these snakes died shortly after being removed from its possession during transportation between Site -██ and a temporary containment cell at Site -██ while being transported by Foundation personnel (see Addendum 10681-5).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10681.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Objective: </b>To determine whether <i>SCP-10681</i> is capable of using tools.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10681</i> was given a bowl of fruit salad and a spoon. It was told to eat the fruit salad without spilling it.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-10681</i> picked up the bowl with one hand, held it upside down, and shook it until all the fruit had fallen out onto its plate . It then proceeded to eat all of the fallen fruit .<br><br><b>Notes: </b>"</i><i>SCP-10681</i> does not seem to be very intelligent.<i>" — Dr. ██████ Experiment #2 <br><br><b>Objectives: </b>To determine whether SCP - 10 681 can use utensils properly when instructed by an authority figure in a nonthreatening manner . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Two plastic spoons were placed on either side of a bowl containing soup ; one spoon was labeled "</i>Eat<i>" , while the other was labeled "</i>Drink<i>" . The experimenter then told SCP - 10 681 that she wanted him/her to drink from one side and eat from another side , so he/she would not get his/her clothes dirty .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After being told this , SCP - 10 681 picked up both spoons simultaneously with his/her forelimbs and tried unsuccessfully for several minutes to place them into his/her mouth before dropping them on the table in frustration ( see Addendum 10681 - 5 ) . The experimenter then took both spoons away from him / her and placed them back into their original positions before telling him / her again what she wanted him / her to do ; he / she complied immediately after this instruction without any further difficulty or confusion (see Addendum 10681-5). <br><br><b>Notes: </b>"</i><i>SCP-10681</i> seems capable of understanding simple commands but is incapable of independent thought .<i>" — Dr. ██████ Experiment #3 <br><br><b>Objectives: </b>To determine whether SCP - 10 681 can understand complex instructions involving multiple steps when they are explained by an authority figure in a nonthreatening manner ; also , see if there are any notable differences between how quickly it understands these instructions compared with simple ones given under similar conditions (see Addendum 1068 1 2 ) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A researcher instructed two D Class personnel wearing lab coats over their street clothes to enter its containment cell carrying clipboards as though they were doctors performing an examination; meanwhile, another researcher entered its cell carrying several sheets of paper covered in random scribbles which looked like medical records; afterwards, they left while taking care not to make eye contact with each other or with anyone else who might have been watching through surveillance cameras outside its containment cell door; afterwards, two more D Class personnel wearing lab coats over street clothing entered carrying clipboards as though they were doctors performing an examination but did not speak at all during this procedure (see Addendum 106 81 3 ). Afterwards, researchers asked if it had any questions about what just happened because something seemed strange about those people who came into its containment cell earlier or if anything else seemed strange about that previous experiment ; researchers repeated question three times before giving up waiting for answer due to time constraints imposed by testing schedule. <br><br><b>Results: </b>At first glance , nothing seemed unusual about those people who came into my containment cell earlier since I've seen many different types come through here during my stay here at Site 19 … however … upon closer inspection … I noticed that none of them wore name tags identifying themselves ! How could you expect me t o know who's who around here when no one tells me anything ?! <br><br><b>Notes: </b>"</i>I think we should stop wasting our time asking questions like these because we're never going anywhere with answers like these ." — Drs . ████ & ████ Experiment #4 <br><br><b>Objectives: </b>To determine whether SC P - 106 81 will attempt escape if provided access via open door leading directly outside site boundaries; also see how long it takes for security teams assigned outside site boundaries under standard protocol regarding high risk objects such as SC P - 106 81 t o respond once alerted t hrough emergency communication system installed on site premises <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researchers opened door leading directly outside Site 19 boundaries while instructing subject via intercom system installed throughout entire facility including inside subject's containment quarters t o walk out slowly towards exit point once doorway has been fully opened ; once subject has reached exit point , researchers closed doorway behind subject using remote control device contained within researcher ' s pocket watch without making direct visual contact with subject after closing doorway behind subject until test</div>
