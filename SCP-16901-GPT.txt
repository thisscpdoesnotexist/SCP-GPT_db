I'm sure that this place has no end! We were ordered to go through all rooms until we find something anomalous, but so far all we have found are crates filled with random objects… But there's one thing that bothers me about these crates… They're exactly alike! And they're not even labelled! Why would you store things like this? We've seen some other rooms as well but they were empty as well… Also there are these weird noises coming from every now and then… Like someone talking or something else.. But I don't think anyone else heard them.. What could be happening here? -Agent ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 16901.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>███ was one of the first persons to enter <i>SCP-16901</i>, after he was found in a room filled with random objects. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>What were you doing in this room? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>I don't know… I just woke up here… And then I saw all these crates filled with random stuff..

It's like they're whispering or something… Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>Can you describe the noises for me? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>[Subject is silent for 5 seconds] No, sorry but it's too hard to hear them. Also there was this one time when someone opened the door and closed it again really fast… Like if they saw something behind us. But we didn't see anything except those crates.
