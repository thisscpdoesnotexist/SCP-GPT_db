Foundation agents embedded within the Kenyan Wildlife Service responded immediately and captured several instances of <i>SCP-9938</i> for containment at Site 19.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9938.1 : </h3>██████████ National Park, Kenya<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Photographer: </b>Agent Zulu-7 (deceased)<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Two adult female <i>SCP-9938</i> instances.<br><br>Photograph taken by Agent Zulu-7 before his death.

First of all, can you tell me your name?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9938</i>: </b>My name is… my name is… uh… what was it again? Oh yeah! It's [REDACTED]. What do you want from me? I didn't do anything wrong!<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>We just want to ask some questions about how you were able to speak English and understand our language so quickly after being captured by us. How did this happen?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9938</i>: </b>You mean how did I learn English? Well, it's easy when there are people around who already know it and they're willing to teach someone else! It's not like we've got anything better to do in there anyway! That reminds me; when are we going out for lunch again today? I'm starving over here! Hey, can one of you get me something from the cafeteria while we're talking here?! C'mon guys, don't be stingy with your money now! You know what they say; 'he who has more money has more fun!' (laughs)<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>No one will be getting you anything until we have finished our interview here today. Now please answer my question; how did this happen exactly? How were you able to speak English so quickly after being captured by us if no one taught it to you directly or indirectly beforehand or during that time period between capture and containment at Site 19?<br><br><b><i>SCP-9938</i>: </b>Oh come on man, don't make me spell everything out for ya', alright?! We've all got brains in our heads too y'know; maybe even a little bit bigger than yours too if I may say so myself (laughs). We picked up a few words here and there while running around in that field before those guys came along with their nets trying to catch us like common criminals or something (snickers). Then when they caught us they put us into these cages where there was nothing else but some books lying around on the floor next door which had pictures of stuff inside them instead of words like those other ones we saw earlier that day outside the park entrance near where our herd was grazing before those guys came along and tried them out first before locking them up back inside their cars or whatever those things were called that carried them around everywhere with them wherever they went in case anyone wanted any pictures taken later on down the road or something like that (snickers). So then since no one else was using 'em at first since everyone else seemed busy doing other stuff besides reading books at first anyways since most people never seem interested in reading stuff unless someone tells 'em otherwise anyways which is why most people never bother learning how either because nobody ever teaches anyone anyways unless someone wants something done for themselves which is why most people never bother learning how either because nobody ever teaches anyone anyway except for teachers who teach others without needing an incentive from anyone else besides themselves usually but not always sometimes teachers need an incentive from others besides themselves too sometimes especially if nobody wants anything done for themselves which is why teachers always try harder than everyone else usually but not always sometimes teachers need an incentive from others besides themselves too sometimes especially if nobody wants anything done for themselves except students who want help getting past their own limitations often enough times enough times enough times enough times enough times often enough often enough often oooonnnnneeeeee eeennnnntttthhhhhttttiiiiimmmmeee!!!!!!

After approximately ten minutes, both instances became visibly distressed and began vocalizing loudly in what was later determined to be Zulu dialects. This behavior continued for approximately thirty seconds before both instances fell unconscious and remained unresponsive for the duration of the experiment. Both subjects expired within twenty four hours from unknown causes. Autopsies revealed no abnormalities aside from a significant buildup of blood clots in major organs which are believed to have contributed to death by cardiac arrest .<br><br></div>
