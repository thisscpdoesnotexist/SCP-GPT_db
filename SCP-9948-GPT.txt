Mobile Task Force Psi-7 (<i>"Meme Collectors"</i>) is to monitor all social media platforms for <i>SCP-9948</i> and remove any instances of it from the internet.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9948</i> is the phrase <i>"I'm just a meme."</i> <i>SCP-9948</i> was discovered after it appeared in a post on Facebook. The post gained over 800 likes and comments within the first 24 hours of its posting, despite not containing any links to external sites.<br><br><i>SCP-9948</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is posted on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. After being posted, <i>SCP-9948</i> will spread rapidly throughout an affected user's friends list, regardless of whether or not they have seen the original post. This effect has been shown to occur even if a user has blocked another user entirely from their account, and even if the two users have never interacted with each other before.<br><br><i>SCP-9948</i> will also appear in posts made by users who are not aware that they are infected by <i>SCP-9948</i> . This can cause large amounts of information regarding <i>SCP-9948</i> to be generated by users who do not know that they are spreading information about it through their posts. In addition, all instances of <i>SCP-9948</i> found online will constantly update themselves with new content related to itself and its effects until deleted manually by an infected individual . Once deleted manually , all instances of <i>SCP-9949</i> found online will revert back into normal text with no anomalous properties . It should be noted that even after deletion , traces of information regarding how to reestablish contact with other instances still remain within infected individuals' memories , though this may only persist for up to 1 week after initial infection .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9948.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████, a user who had been infected by <i>SCP-9948</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9948.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9948, a 23 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9948 was instructed to post the phrase <i>"I'm just a meme"</i> on Facebook. <br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected, <i>SCP-9948</i> spread rapidly throughout D-9948's friends list .
