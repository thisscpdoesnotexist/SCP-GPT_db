A janitor working at the school also reported that he had been unable to do any cleaning because he kept getting distracted by what <i>SCP-15520</i> was saying. The janitor reported that he had heard <i>"the most interesting story about how Shakespeare invented words"</i> from one of his classes, and said that it was <i>"the most interesting thing [he] had ever heard"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15520.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, who was exposed to <i>SCP-15520</i>'s anomalous properties<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Ross </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview took place after the exposure of D-2223 to <i>SCP-15520</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Ross: </b>Hello, Mr. ████? I'm Dr. Ross from the Foundation, and I'd like to ask you a few questions about your experience with <i>SCP-15520</i> earlier today. <br><br><b>█████: </b>Oh, sure! That guy was great! He told us this really interesting story about how Shakespeare invented words! It was so cool! <br><br><b>Dr. Ross: </b>Uh… yes… that is very interesting… could you tell me more about what he said? What did he say exactly? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well he started out by telling us that Shakespeare invented over 1700 words in his lifetime and then went on to say that Shakespeare had never been able to make up a word until one day when he needed a word for <i>"a small amount of liquid"</i>. So then he decided to make up a word for it which turned out to be <i>"drop"</i> but apparently there were already two different words that meant drop at the time so Shakespeare decided not use it as a word but instead just used it as an example in his play Romeo and Juliet where Juliet says something like <i>"I have drops of Jupiter on my face"</i> or something like that and everyone thought she meant she had water on her face but she actually meant sweat because Jupiter is another name for Zeus which is another name for rain so she actually said <i>"I have drops of rain on my face"</i>. And then later when people saw her sweating they thought she was crying because they called tears drops too even though tears are actually made from mucus instead of sweat so if anyone ever tells you they're crying because someone hurt their feelings remember what Juliet said next time and tell them they're wrong because their tears aren't made from sweat no matter how much they cry or how hard someone hits them or whatever else happens cause nobody ever cries because their feelings get hurt no matter what anyone else says otherwise we'd all be crying our eyes out every night just cause we stubbed our toe or something stupid like that right? And then after Romeo hears her talking about having drops of rain on her face he thinks its blood even though its sweat cuz apparently back in those days people didn't know any better than thinking blood came outta your pores when you sweated even though now we know its only snot coming outta your nose cuz thats where all snot comes from right? Then later when Romeo finds Juliet dead in the tomb with some poison still left inside him some people think maybe it wasn't poison at all maybe it was just regular old wine which would make sense since everyone knows wine makes you drunk but if thats true why do we call alcohol alcohol instead of drunk right? Maybe it should be called drunk since thats whats really happening anyway right [laughs] see whats happening here doctor is I'm using examples here too see if I can teach you anything new while Im teaching myself this stuff better by remembering stuff other people already taught me [laughs] sorry gotta go now doc gotta teach class again later bye bye <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview D-2223 reported feeling extremely tired and fell asleep immediately after leaving the room despite being given coffee beforehand as an attempt to keep him awake during the interview.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15520.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 15520-1<br><br>Subject(s): D-12373, a female college student.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-12373 is instructed to enter <i>SCP-15520</i>'s containment cell and listen to him teach for 10 minutes.

L ewis C lemmens , one of her colleagues who had been missing since 201 3 , while walking through Site - 19 near the cafeteria area with two other individuals (later identified as his wife and son). Agent Ko yle approached them and asked if they knew where Dr . Clemme ns lived because she wanted some advice on buying a new house in town; however, both Mrs Clemme ns and her son seemed confused when asked about him because they claimed that they have never heard about anyone named Lewis Clemmens before despite having been married for 25 years with one child together (her son). When questioned further about why they were visiting Site 19 from their home state of California , Mrs Clemme ns reported that she didn't even remember driving here until Agent Ko yle reminded her that she drove here with her husband last week when Site 19 first opened up due to recent renovations being done on their house which required them moving out temporarily until construction finished; however, Mrs Clemme ns still insisted that there must be some mistake because there wasn't any construction being done on their house recently nor did they ever plan on moving out since Mr Clement s loved living there too much despite having no idea why she would say such things considering all these events never happened according to her memory prior today even though Agent Ko yle clearly remembered those events happening when talking with her directly just moments ago prior today (See Addendum 15 520 3)</div>
