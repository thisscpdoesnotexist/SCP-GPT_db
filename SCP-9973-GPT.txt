What's your name? Boy: My name is *****. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Do you remember playing the game Super Mario Bros.? Boy: Yeah, that game was awesome! It was so fun! I beat it all the time! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>And did anything unusual happen while you were playing it? Boy (shaking his head): No… not really… Wait a minute… There was something weird going on at one point in the game… I think it might have been when I got to World 8-3 or something like that… That's when everything started getting freaky, but then I beat the level and everything went back to normal again… (Boy pauses for a few seconds) Oh yeah! And there were those weird statues in World 8-3 too! They looked kind of scary at first but then they turned into coins when they died or something like that! What were they again? Drs. ██████ & ████ (simultaneously): <i>SCP-9973</i> Boy (laughing): Ha ha ha ha ha!! You guys are so silly!! Those weren't statues; those were just regular enemies from earlier levels!! …You're not joking right? They really weren't statues? But how could they be alive if they weren't even real?! That doesn't make any sense!!! Why would someone put living things in their video games?! That's just messed up!!! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The boy appeared confused after being informed of <i>SCP-9973</i>'s existence and refused further questioning on the subject matter after expressing an intense fear towards video games as a whole due to this knowledge . He has since been placed under psychiatric care for observation purposes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9973.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9973, a Level 2 Security guard.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to play Super Mario 64 for 15 minutes. After the test, subject was interviewed about his experience. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject claims that he saw a large lava monster with two white eyes and two red eyes that burned everything it touched. He also claimed that he heard a voice telling him to <i>"burn everything"</i>. Interviewer's <br><br><b>Notes: </b>The experiment was repeated with D-9973 playing Super Mario 64 DS for 15 minutes; however, no anomalous effects were observed. Test #: 2<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-9973 and D-9372, both Level 2 Security guards. Both subjects were instructed to play Super Mario Sunshine for 30 minutes each in separate rooms of Site 19's recreational area (which is equipped with televisions). <br><br><b>Results: </b>During the experiment, both subjects reported seeing an entity similar to SCP-███ appearing in front of them; however, they described it as being more humanoid than SCP-███ is normally depicted as being (i.e., having arms and legs). Interviewer's <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It is unknown whether this anomaly has any relation to <i>SCP-9973</i> or not at this time; further testing on other games in the series will be required before any conclusions can be drawn from this experiment. Test # 3 <br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-9373 and Researcher ████████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher ████████ played Luigi's Mansion for 30 minutes while subject watched from another room via closed circuit camera feed . <br><br><b>Results: </b>No anomalous activity detected during test period . Interviewer ' s <br><br><b>Notes: </b>No anomalies detected during interview either . Seems like 99 73 doesn 't have an effect on everyone , but I still recommend against playing those games alone , just in case . - Dr . █████████</div>
