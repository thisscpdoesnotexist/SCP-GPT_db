Any personnel who have been exposed to <i>SCP-9928</i> are not allowed within a 100 meter radius of the containment cell unless approved by Level 3 personnel.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9928</i> is a contagious and persistent hallucination of a handgun directed at the viewer's temple. The hallucination is not visible to all viewers; approximately 30% of the population are susceptible to <i>SCP-9928</i>, while 70% are immune. Once affected by <i>SCP-9928</i>, subjects will experience visual hallucinations of an entity pointing a pistol at their temple, or any other location on their body. These hallucinations persist for as long as the subject remains conscious.<br><br><i>SCP-9928</i> was first discovered in ██████, Texas after reports of local citizens experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations began to surface in local newspapers. Foundation agents embedded within the police force investigated these reports and discovered several individuals who had been affected by <i>SCP-9928</i>, including one who had committed suicide due to its effects (see Addendum). Agents were able to contain <i>SCP-9928</i> before it spread further than ██████ County; however, several individuals were exposed during this containment operation (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9928.1 : </h3> ██████, Texas<br><br>On █/██/████, <i>SCP-9928</i> was discovered in the city of ██████, Texas after several citizens reported experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. Foundation agents embedded within the police force investigated these reports and discovered several individuals who had been affected by <i>SCP-9928</i>.

I'm here to ask you a few questions about your recent experiences with hallucinations. Please state your name for the record. Subject <br><br><b>D-9928: </b>[REDACTED] Agent <br><br><b>L███: </b>Thank you, Mr.[REDACTED]. Now then… could you tell me what exactly happened? How did it start? Subject <br><br><b>D-9928: </b>Well… I woke up one morning and saw this gun pointed at my head on my nightstand next to me when I woke up… just like that! It was so real! And then it started pointing at other places on my body too! It would move around if I moved around or looked away from it but as soon as I looked back at it again it would be there pointing right at me! It's driving me crazy! Agent <br><br><b>L███: </b>Did anything else happen after this? Any changes in behavior or appearance of the hallucination? Subject <br><br><b>D-9928: </b>Yeah… well first off all of my friends told me they couldn't see anything like that but they thought something was wrong with me because of how scared I looked all the time and how jumpy I got whenever someone pointed a finger at their head while joking around or something like that…. Then later on people started telling stories about a guy named <i>"The Pistol Man"</i> who is wandering around town looking for people to kill himself so he can get into heaven faster…. He's even killed three people already by shooting them in the head with an imaginary pistol…. But nobody can see him except those affected by this thing called <i>"The Pistol Man"</i>… They say he'll shoot anyone he sees who isn't affected by The Pistol Man… He shot two police officers yesterday because they weren't infected by The Pistol Man…. They say he has some kind of magic powers that let him walk through walls and stuff….. Everyone is really scared now….. There are rumors going around saying we're gonna be attacked any day now….. What if we're attacked tomorrow?! What if we get attacked tonight?! Are you gonna protect us!? We need protection from The Pistol Man!!!
