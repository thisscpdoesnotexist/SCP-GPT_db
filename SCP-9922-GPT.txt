All instances of <i>SCP-9922</i> are to be monitored at all times via closed circuit television. Any attempts by an instance of <i>SCP-9922</i> to remove or damage its eyes is to be met with force, up to and including termination if necessary.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9922</i> is a condition characterized by the growth of supernumerary eyes (hereby referred to as <i>SCP-9922</i>-1) on a subject's body. The number and location of these eyes varies from subject to subject, but all instances of <i>SCP-9922</i> are capable of sight.<br><br><i>SCP-9922</i> was first discovered in ████, Germany when Foundation operatives embedded in local law enforcement were alerted to several reports regarding individuals with extra eyes. Class A amnestics were administered and the phenomenon was successfully contained until its discovery in ████████, Brazil a year later. At this point it became apparent that <i>SCP-9922</i> had spread beyond initial containment parameters and Foundation resources were reallocated accordingly.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9922.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████<br><br>The following interview was conducted on █/██/20██ with the subject of <i>SCP-9922</i>-1, identified as ███████ ██████. The interview was conducted in English, the subject's native language.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. Léonard <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an excerpt from an interview with a subject affected by <i>SCP-9922</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Foreman: </b>Good morning Mr. ██████, I'm Doctor Foreman and I'll be conducting your evaluation today. How are you feeling? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>I feel fine… Why do you ask? <br><br><b>Dr. Foreman: </b>Well we have some concerns about your health and it would help us if we could get to the bottom of them as soon as possible so that we can provide you with the best care possible and make sure that everything is alright, so if there is anything at all that you can tell us about how you're feeling then please do so now because time is of the essence here Mr.: Okay… Well I don't know what this thing on my head is but it doesn't hurt or anything like that and it doesn't really bother me either but sometimes it looks at me when I'm not looking at it which makes me feel uncomfortable for some reason… Is there something wrong with that? Dr.: No no nothing's wrong at all! It's just very rare for one to develop an extra eye naturally without any treatment whatsoever so we were just wondering how long this has been going on for? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Oh well uhm… It just sorta happened yesterday actually! When did they start doing these kinds of tests anyways?! Are they trying to find out what caused me to grow this thing?! That's not my fault! They should stop looking into things like this! They're only gonna make things worse in the end anyway! We shouldn't be messing around with stuff like this man! We should be trying to fix our problems instead of making new ones right!? You guys don't even know what kind of damage you could cause by studying stuff like this man!! You can never go back once something has been changed y'know!? Like uhm…. What happened down in Brazil a few years ago man….. That wasn't good was it…. Man…. [Subject begins sobbing] Can someone give him a sedative please? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After several minutes had passed, two guards entered the room carrying syringes filled with tranquilizers which were administered directly into both eyes (<i>SCP-9922</i>-1) via hypodermic needle causing them both to recede into their sockets almost immediately afterwards followed shortly by complete loss of consciousness lasting approximately ten minutes before awakening spontaneously without any recollection or awareness regarding his outburst prior to sedation being administered . Following his recovery he was escorted back into containment where he remained until termination occurred three days later due to complications associated with severe dehydration resulting from overuse of his eyes during testing leading up until his death .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9922.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9922-01<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9922-01 is to be restrained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. <i>SCP-9922</i> is then to be surgically removed from the subject. A control group of D-class personnel will undergo the same procedure without removal of <i>SCP-9922</i>. All instances of <i>SCP-9922</i> are to be monitored at all times via closed circuit television. Any attempts by an instance of <i>SCP-9922</i> to remove or damage its eyes is to be met with force, up to and including termination if necessary.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Removal of all instances of <i>SCP-9922</i> resulted in immediate death due to total loss of ocular function. Instances were observed attempting self amputation for approximately 10 minutes before expiring due to complications resulting from their lack of vision and inability move around freely while attempting said action, including but not limited too; falling off tables, tripping over objects and/or people, running into walls/obstructions and/or falling down stairs or slopes if they were present in the containment area at the time (see addendum 9923). Control group subjects showed no signs that any change occurred after surgery was performed on them aside from a small amount blood loss caused by surgical tools used during procedure (see addendum 9923).<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 99 22 - 02 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous experiment with addition that one instance each eye removed will have its optic nerve severed prior operation . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Instance's brain was able not only compensate for lack visual input from remaining eyes , but also utilize information provided by optic nerves attached eyes . Subject continued performing tasks normally despite removal all instances eyes . Eye movements made more erratic than normal , suggesting that brain has difficulty processing information received through multiple sources simultaneously . Subject also noted feeling <i>"numb"</i> when asked about sensation provided by removed organs , adding further support theory that brain unable process sensory input properly when receiving it through multiple channels simultaneously . <br><br><b>Addendum: </b>On ██ / █ / 20██ during scheduled weekly cleaning staff reported hearing noises coming from containment area where subject undergoing testing at time was being held . Upon investigation it was found that subject had managed somehow remove both arms with use teeth despite fact he had been sedated prior surgery as part of test protocol ( see experiment log 9 9 2 - 0 1 ) and restraints still attached limbs after procedure completed ( see experiment log 9 9 2 - 0 1 ) When questioned about how he managed accomplish this feat subject replied <i>" I just did what felt right "</i>.<br><br></div>
