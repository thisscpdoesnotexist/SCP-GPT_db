This is a long scp..<br><br><h5>Item #:</h5> <i>SCP-9003-GPT</i><br><br><h5>Object Class:</h5> Keter<br><br><h5>Special Containment Procedures:</h5> **********<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9003-GPT</i> is a phenomenon that occurs when the Foundation enters a situation where there are too many anomalies, causing **********. The SCP-9003 manifestations begin to happen at this point. This happens on O5 orders; no other personnel are to be informed of SCP-9003's existence, except for those who directly encounter it.<br><br><h5>SCP-9003 manifests as rooms in the form of an irregular tetrahedron, looping and warping in ways that make them impossible to observe from one angle and only possible to observe from another angle. Going inside these rooms causes you to disappear into one of two places:</h5> "The Room", or "Outside". These rooms appear in times when there are too many anomalies and they need somewhere to go - though it is not known how these rooms can appear without being noticed by the rest of the facility (See Addendum 9003C).<br><br><h5>The Room:</h5> In "the room", you will find yourself in a grey void with nothing else around you - not even air or space, just greyness until eventually you fade out of existence entirely. It is unknown if this is truly death or just a form of imprisonment - but either way does lead further into SCP-9003's effects…<br><br><h5>Outside:</h5> If you were chosen for Outside, then congratulations! You have been chosen by higher powers! As far as anyone knows, whatever lies outside cannot be explained through conventional means; but those who have visited describe it as 'paradise', 'heaven', 'a new start' etcetera etcetera just before their memories become corrupted/destroyed after leaving. There has never been any proof that what people say about Outside is true, but everyone who has spoken about it once leaving has claimed they experienced something positive upon entering…(see addendum 9003B)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9003 was first discovered when it was found that rooms were appearing in the facility. They appeared to be empty at first, but after a few more rooms appeared, researchers inside them began to disappear.<br><br><br><br><h5>+ Addendum 9003A - Hide Addendum 9003A SCP-9003 was found by chance after another researcher wandered into one of the rooms and disappeared. After hearing this from other researchers, Dr ████ went through one himself and met up with a man who he believed to be his son in law (who had died two years prior). This man referred to him as 'Jeff' and claimed that they had spent time together before he had died at the age of 59 - despite Dr ████ not ever having met this man before. The Foundation has since tried locating any relatives of Dr ████ who are alive, for verification purposes; however none could be located within the United States or Europe - nor could they find any records of his son in law existing either - which begs the question:</h5> Where did these people come from? When asked what year it is, "Jeff" stated it was 2056; yet when questioned about what happened between now and then he became agitated until walking back into <i>SCP-9001-GPT</i> without warning (This room only appears once every five minutes). Despite being initially excited over this finding, more anomalous occurrences began happening around GPT including objects appearing out of thin air or disappearing if observed too long from a certain angle (See Addendum 9003C); causing panic among all staff members until eventually O5 ordered all information on SCP-9001's existence hidden away from everyone except those who directly encountered them/were affected by them. Once all information regarding GPT's existence were hidden away there was no longer any reason for such an anomalous phenomenon to occur; meaning that once again staff members stopped disappearing inside these rooms… In addition there has never been any proof that anything lies outside; so why do so many people insist on going there when given the choice?<br><br><br><br><h5>+ Addendum 9003B – hide addendum # Access Granted Interview Logs [Interview Logs] [Interviewer ] [Interviewee] Date: 06/04/2032 Interviewer: Doctor Terry Lightstone Subject: Dr Joshua Lightstone Transcript:: <BEGIN LOG> Terry Lightstone enters room nine with Joshua Lightstone following closely behind him. Joshua Lightstone takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes before sitting down on one of three chairs placed against each wall while Terry sits opposite him across from a table with three cups against its surface as well as two plates containing different types of cakes resting upon them. Terry Lightstone:</h5> Hello Josh! How are you today? Joshua Lightstone takes off his jacket while replying "I'm fine thanks", taking out some papers along with a pen lying nearby onto which he writes something down onto using black ink and then places said pen back down next to where it originally lay<br><br><h5>Addendum 9003.1:</h5><br><br><br><br><h5>[Dr Terry Lightstone] "You've been working here for some time now, how long have you been here exactly?" [Dr Joshua Lightstone] "Well I joined in 2039 on the 15th of March, so that makes it… twelve years?" <END LOG> Closing Statement: After a short while of talking with Dr Lightstone, he suddenly stands up and leaves the room without warning. This is not unusual as he has done this before in other interviews; however when questioned about his sudden departure afterwards he claimed that it was nothing and wouldn't go into further detail regarding this event. Interview Logs Addendum 9003.2:</h5><br><br><h5>[Dr Terry Lightstone] "Were you aware of any anomalous objects appearing during your time at Site 19? Do you know if there were any discovered after your departure?" [Dr Joshua Lightstone] "No I wasn't aware of anything like that occurring prior to my leaving but then again I wasn't working down in containment at the time." <END LOG> Closing Statement: Dr Joshua lightstones response seems to coincide with what we already knew; however interviewing him should hopefully prove more useful with regards to discovering anything anomalous - due to him having spent a great deal of his career down in site 19's primary containment units (See Addendum 9003C).

It was then that I noticed him clutching something inside a pocket…so I asked him what it was. Then, without warning, he simply stood up and left the room - claiming once again it was nothing but refusing to elaborate further upon this event (See Addendum9003A). When I later checked said pocket, I discovered an old photograph of Dr Lightstone and another man standing together in front of some trees wearing clothing from the 1950s - which is strange as we have never found any relatives who fit his description (Dr Lightstone has no children or siblings) so where did these people come from?
