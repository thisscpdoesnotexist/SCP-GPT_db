An anomalous item will be transported to the place where person and SCP-9003 are, and this item will be changed into an instance of SCP-████ (these instances are referred as SCP-9003's "contents".) These instances have anomalous properties:</h5> - They always appear in a state they were in 5 minutes before their transportation (for example, if they were damaged or destroyed before transportation, they would still have damages or injuries after teleportation.) - Their appearance will not change (even though some items can't be seen directly through this method.) - They cannot store any information except for memories (e.g., pictures taken with smartphones) and cannot perform any functions other than those associated with their original purpose. - Instances have unique identification numbers; these numbers are stored in identificators which had been created for them before transportation occurred .<br><br><br>SCP Foundation logo<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9003 was discovered when a resident of Moscow was found to have been injured during the transportation of an instance of SCP-████.
