This is a long SCP with lots of victims.<br><br><h5>Item #:</h5> <i>SCP-9003</i><br><br><h5>Object Class:</h5> Safe<br><br><h5>Special Containment Procedures:</h5> <i>SCP-9003</i> is to be stored in a containment locker in Site ██, and is not to be used by any personnel. It should never leave this chamber unless given permission by a direct superior. If it appears that <i>SCP-9003</i> has been stolen or lost, the object is to be decommissioned and incinerated.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9003</i> is an orange plastic compass. It has a picture of Lady Gaga holding hands with a [REDACTED]. The device does not appear to be anomalous, and is perfectly functional for its intended purpose.<br><br><i>SCP-9003</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when the object enters the proximity of anyone who has listened to any Lady Gaga song in its entirety at least once. After this occurs, SCP-9003 will point towards the nearest fan of Lady Gaga, regardless of distance or barriers. The object will only cease to function after it has led its user within 50 meters of a heavily populated Lady Gaga concert, whereupon it will shatter and immediately begin emitting large quantities of gamma radiation in all directions until containment can be established. This process takes less than one second from start to finish; it should also be noted that anyone within 50 meters of this process is instantly killed by the effects .<br><br>To date, ██ instances have been logged; fortunately due to their small size (the largest recorded instance was three centimeters long), these objects are relatively easy to contain if discovered early on .<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> <i>SCP-9003</i> was found on ██/██/████, after an incident in the town of ████, California. A local man, █████ H█████ D█████ , claimed that he had been attacked by a "giant anti-Lady Gaga" and subsequently entered a Lady Gaga fan club to escape it. SCP officers were called, and they proceeded to recover the object from his location as well as several others .<br><br><h5>Addendum 9003.1:</h5> Interview with D████ H██████, the first recorded victim<br><br><h5>Interviewed: █████ H██████ D█ Interviewer: Dr. █████████ <Begin Log> Dr. █████████: So tell me what happened that night. What did you see? [D█ does not answer.] Can you describe it for us? [D█ remains silent.] Dr. █████████: Mr. H██████, I need you to- [D█ begins screaming and clawing at his arms] Dr. █████████: Mr. H██████! Stop! We can help- [D█ continues] Dr. █████████: Alright, alright… calm down… just take a breath… D█ stops screaming and looks up at the doctor in front of him . D██ : Please… please help me.. I don't want to die here.. SCP Agent outside of the door : Leave him alone! We should go by now! It's too dangerous in there!! SCP Agent #2 outside of the door : No we can't move yet we still have work to do!! … The second agent is heard talking on her radio . The sound is muffled but audible though static . SCP Agent #2 : Yes sir this whole town has been affected by some kind of anti Lady Gaga entity it destroyed all local Lady Gaga fans In town but they weren't really dead more like just unconscious , there might be more victims trapped under rubble we haven't checked yet but this anomaly seems harmless now no other anomalies detected on my end wait one more thing sir I found a compass some guy was holding when he came out , takes off her helmet to reveal a short african american woman with black hair around 40 years old wearing an SPC uniform with two stripes on her collar , she takes off her mask and throws it onto ground . Woman 1 : It's pointing towards that building over there so this must be where it came from right ? Man 3 (Man 3 is pointing towards another building) :</h5> Who cares ! We have our orders clear out the area then report back ! Woman 2 (wearing an SPC uniform as well ) puts down her gun and goes back into building along with man 2 while man 1 stays behind looking into building trying to see what's happening inside then he turns around looking down at his compass which somehow appears broken into little pieces falling onto ground as if someone threw something really hard at it or dropped something heavy from very high up … Man 1 starts walking away without saying anything while woman 2 comes back out carrying some random person who was hiding in house under bed she yells " Hey guys come over here quick got one who must've survived or maybe he was never infected maybe he knows what happened!" as she walks onto street putting random guy on floor . Woman 2 picks up random guy placing him face up looking directly into camera while everyone else gets closer then suddenly everything goes blurry for about five seconds then after those five seconds restarts focusing only on woman 2s face again - eyes<br><br><h5>Addendum9003.2:</h5> Recovered Documents<br><br>The following document was recovered from the wreckage of H████'s house, along with <i>SCP-9003</i>. It is believed to be a letter written by Mr. H████ to his son, who has not been located at this time.</div>
