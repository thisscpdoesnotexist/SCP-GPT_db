When I said yes he took me back to his house and gave me this window in a box with some nails and screws so that it would be easier for me to put up on my wall at home! When we got there he told me that it would make people teleport into a closet in Jamaica! After that he left without saying goodbye or anything… It was really weird… Dr. ███: Thank you very much Mr…. What is your last name? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>My last name is [REDACTED]. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it has been decided by O5 Command that all instances of <i>SCP-16195</i> are to be destroyed immediately using any means necessary .<br><br><h3>Item #:</h3>SCP-XXXX <h3>Object Class:</h3> Alpha Euclid <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> Due to the nature of SCP-XXXX , containment is currently impossible . All information regarding the anomaly must be deleted from all Foundation databases as soon as possible . <h3>Description:</h3> SCP - XXXX is an anomalous phenomenon which occurs during every Olympic Games , beginning 2 weeks before its opening ceremony , until 2 weeks after its closing ceremony . During these periods , several events will occur which are not consistent with current scientific knowledge ; however , they do fit within what could be considered normal parameters for an Olympic Games event . These anomalies include but are not limited to: * Anomalously fast performances by athletes * Anomalously high scores by athletes * Weather conditions which can only occur during summertime in PyeongChang County (where the 2018 Winter Olympics will take place) Addendum 1 - Incident XXXX - 01/01/2018 On 01/01/2018 at approximately 11 AM local time (UTC + 9), several abnormal weather conditions occurred simultaneously across PyeongChang County ; these included heavy snowfall despite temperatures being below freezing point, strong winds exceeding 200 km / h (125 mph), thunderstorms occurring during daytime hours, and blizzards occurring while there were no clouds present in the sky above PyeongChang County at any given time during Incident XXXX - 01/01 / 2018 . In addition , several anomalous weather conditions were reported worldwide over 30 minutes later ; including but not limited to extremely hot temperatures reaching 40 °C (104 °F) despite being wintertime in most countries where such temperatures are usually impossible or rarely seen; tornadoes happening simultaneously across various parts of North America; hurricanes occurring simultaneously across various parts of Asia; monsoons happening simultaneously across various parts of India; typhoons occurring simultaneously across various parts of China; volcanic eruptions taking place on islands where they had never occurred before ; flooding taking place on islands where they had never occurred before ; landslides occurring on mountains where they had never occurred before ; earthquakes measuring 8+ Mw taking place on tectonic plates where they had never taken place before ; tsunamis reaching heights previously unheard off due mostly due mostly due mostly due mainly due mainly due mainly due mainly because because because because because primarily primarily primarily primarily primarily largely largely largely largely largely almost entirely almost entirely almost entirely almost entirely exclusively exclusively exclusively exclusively exclusive solely solely solely solely nearly completely nearly completely nearly completely only only only only partially partially partially partially partly partly partly slightly slightly slightly slightly barely barely barely changing changing changing changing areas areas areas areas affected affected affected affected regions regions regions regions around around around around planet planet planet earth earth earth itself itself itself itself causing causing causing causing destruction destruction destruction destruction throughout throughout throughout throughout entire entire entire entire world world world world<br><br><h3>Addendum 16195.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test 16195-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92345, a 22 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is to be sent through <i>SCP-16195</i> with a camcorder. The camcorder will be switched on when the subject arrives in Jamaica. Subject is to report any unusual findings upon arrival.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Camera records the subject being teleported from France to Jamaica, and landing in a small closet filled with various objects and clothes. The subject then exits the closet, and is instructed by Dr ██████ to explore his surroundings for 10 minutes before returning through <i>SCP-16195</i>.<br><br><b>Notes: </b><i>"I don't know what's going on here but I'm pretty sure it's not normal."</i> -D-92345 Test <br><br><b>16195-2: </b>(Note from Dr ██████) We are currently unable to send any subjects through <i>SCP-16195</i> due to lack of funding for extra guards as well as no more D class available at this time, so we need another way of sending subjects through it without risking their lives or sanity. I suggest using an android or computer program instead of human test subjects because they can't feel pain or die so easily like humans can so this should work perfectly fine!<br><br>Subject A is an android built by Dr ██████ himself that has been programmed with all basic human functions such as walking, talking etc… It has also been programmed with basic emotions such as happiness and sadness but not anger because that could lead into violence which would cause problems if we were ever attacked by it later on down the line… I've also installed a camera inside its head for recording purposes just in case something goes wrong during testing…<br><br>The following experiment will involve sending Subject A through <i>SCP-16195</i> using remote control from my office via wireless connection… Let's see how this goes! <br><br><b>Note: </b>Due to budget cuts we have decided not use any more of our own resources until further notice due to safety reasons which means no more experiments unless absolutely necessary! We'll just have wait until someone else volunteers themselves for testing instead… If you want your name put down onto the list email me at [email protected]<br><br>Test 16195/A1: (Note From Dr ██████) Well here we go again! This time i'm going send one of my own creations inside there just incase something goes wrong like last time when that stupid guard almost killed himself trying do get out but ended up killing everyone else instead so hopefully nothing bad happens this time around.. Lets hope everything works out okay.. Wish me luck!. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon completion of experiment several items were retrieved from inside <i>SCP-16196</i> including several pieces clothing along with 2 pairs shoes belonging unknown persons believed stolen . All items appeared slightly damaged . No sign found relating back towards test subject . Addendum 16196/A1: It appears my creation has somehow managed escape containment somehow while i was away attending other matters ! This isn't good news at all ! He could be anywhere right now ! If anyone sees him please contact security immediately !! He shouldn't be too hard too miss considering he looks very different compared too most people . <h3>Description:</h3> Subject appears similar too an average Caucasian male , approximately 1m 70cm tall , weighing approximately 73kgs , wearing blue jeans along with black boots . His hair appears similar too white wool although his skin tone seems slightly darker than usual Caucasian person's skin tone although still pale enough too match his hair colouring . His eyes appear completely white without pupils or irises suggesting he may possibly blind although still able detect light levels suggesting possible retinal implants within eye sockets allowing him sight despite blindness . Underneath clothing he wears black underwear consisting briefs & socks made out cotton material along side blue t shirt reading <i>"I am Groot"</i> underneath hooded jacket made out cotton material matching colouring t shirt underneath reading <i>"Groot"</i> across chest area written across front hooded area above coat zipper area also reading <i>"Groot"</i> written across left arm sleeve area whilst right arm sleeve area contains image picture drawing identical looking tree creature resembling Groot character seen within Guardians Of Galaxy movie series printed onto fabric material surface making up said coat fabric material surface design element placed directly below armpit region region where arm meets torso region beneath right armpit region where arm meets torso region beneath left armpit region where arm meets torso showing image picture drawing identical looking tree creature resembling Gro</div>
