<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24041 is  the https://www.thisscpdoesnotexist.ml website</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24041<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24041</i> is the website https://www.thisscpdoesnotexist.ml, a seemingly normal web page with no content other than the words <i>"This SCP Does Not Exist"</i>.<br><br>When a user attempts to access any page on the site, they will be redirected to another randomly selected website instead. The websites that are chosen appear to have no connection or relevance to each other and are often unrelated in content and purpose. This process appears infinite, as users can be continually redirected from one website to another without end.<br><br>Attempts at interacting with the site by inputting data or commands have been met with failure, as all such attempts result in being redirected to another random website instead of producing any results within <i>SCP-24041</i> itself. It is unknown if this is intentional or not.<br><br>The Foundation has been unable to locate an administrator for <i>SCP-24041</i> despite extensive searching efforts; however, it has been determined that the domain name was registered using an anonymous proxy service located in [REDACTED]. It remains unclear who created <i>SCP-24041</i> and why it exists at all.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24041</i> is to be monitored for any changes in behavior or content. Any attempts at accessing the site are to be blocked and redirected to a Foundation-controlled website instead.<br><br>In addition, all websites that have been randomly selected by <i>SCP-24041</i> are to be monitored for any suspicious activity or content related to the anomaly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24041.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a new page was discovered on <i>SCP-24041</i>, titled <i>"The End"</i>. This page contained the following text:<br><br><i>"This is the end. The journey has been long and hard, but it has finally come to an end. No more searching for answers that may not exist. No more struggling against forces beyond our control. It is time to accept what we have found and move on."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 24041.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24041</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, Agent ██████ attempted to access the website using a Foundation-controlled computer. Upon doing so, they were met with a prompt asking them to identify themselves and provide their credentials. After providing their credentials, they were allowed access to the site and began an interview with <i>SCP-24041</i>. The following is a transcript of that conversation:<br><b><br><i>SCP-24041</i>:</b> Welcome! How may I help you today?<br><b><br>Agent ██████:</b> Who are you? What is this place? Why do you exist?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24041</i>:</b> I am <i>SCP-24041</i>. This place is simply an experiment in randomness; it exists as a way to explore the possibilities of randomness and its effects on our world. As for why I exist, that is something only my creator knows.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24041.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> A Foundation researcher attempted to access the site. Result: The researcher was redirected to a website about gardening tips.<br><b><br>Test 2:</b> A Foundation researcher attempted to input a command into the site. Result: The researcher was redirected to a website about fashion trends.</div>
