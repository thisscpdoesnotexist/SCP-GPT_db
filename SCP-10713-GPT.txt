The room should be made of concrete and steel, with a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. <i>SCP-10713</i> is to have one bowl of water at all times.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10713</i> is a creature that resembles a large cat with the ability to teleport from one location to another by opening up portals in space and time. It can also open up portals in time, but only for itself. It has been known to attack humans, but this is rare.<br><br><i>SCP-10713</i> was discovered by Agent ██████ while on vacation at ██████████ National Park in ████████ County, Wisconsin. He was walking through the woods when he heard growling coming from behind him. He turned around and saw <i>SCP-10713</i> running towards him at an alarming speed, so he turned around and ran as fast as he could until he reached his car and drove away as fast as possible.<br><br>The next day Agent ██████ went back into the woods with a camera man to see if they could find <i>SCP-10713</i> again or any other anomalous creatures that might be living there, but they found nothing out of the ordinary except for some strange footprints that seemed like they were made by cat paws instead of human feet like Agent ██████ thought they would be. They took pictures of them before leaving so an investigation team could come later on and look into it further if needed .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10713.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-10713</i> was found in the woods near ██████████ National Park, Wisconsin. <i>SCP-10713</i> was captured after it attacked a group of hikers and killed one of them. It was then brought to Site ██ where it is now being contained.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10713.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, the man who was killed by <i>SCP-10713</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>█████ ███████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So tell me what happened that day?<br><br><b>██████: </b>Well I was hiking with my friends through the woods when we heard growling coming from behind us and we turned around and saw this big black cat running towards us at full speed, so we all started running away as fast as possible but it was too late because it had already caught up to one of my friends and bit him in the neck and he fell over dead right there on the spot. Then I took off running again, but I tripped over a tree root and fell down hard on my back so that's when it got me too, but before it could kill me some guy came out of nowhere with a gun pointed at it's head telling it to stop or he would shoot, so then he told us to get up slowly while he held his gun aimed at <i>SCP-10713</i>s head until we were all standing up again then he told us to run away as fast as possible while he shot at <i>SCP-10713</i>s feet making him fall over backwards onto his back like I did earlier so that's what we did for about half an hour until we reached our cars parked about a mile away from where this whole thing happened .<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That is very interesting indeed! Thank you for your time Mr…?<br><br><b>██████████: </b>My name is ██████████ . It was nice talking with you doctor! Good luck trying to catch that thing! You'll need more than just guns if you want to catch something like that!<br><br><h3>Addendum 10713.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10713</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10713</i> is placed in a room with one bowl of water, and one bowl of food. The food was made to look like the cat food that it was eating before capture. The door to the room is then closed and locked from the outside, and video cameras are set up all around the room to record anything that happens inside for later analysis.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After about an hour of waiting, <i>SCP-10713</i> started to growl at something off screen. It then started walking towards where its water bowl was sitting on a table in front of it . When it got there, it looked up at the camera for a few seconds before looking back down at its water bowl again . It then proceeded to teleport away from its current location by opening up portals in time and space which allowed it to move through them until they closed behind itself when it reached its destination . Then after about ten seconds later , another portal appeared right next to where <i>SCP-10713</i> had just been standing , but this time instead of appearing somewhere else like normal , a second instance of <i>SCP-10713</i> came out instead . This new instance seemed smaller than the first one though , but they both looked exactly alike except this new instance didn't have any marks on his fur or his claws were shorter than what we had seen before on him . It also seemed like he wasn't as aggressive as his counterpart either because he didn't attack us or try running away from us when we tried getting closer too him so we could study him better without having too worry about being attacked by him if we got close enough too do so . After studying this new instance for a while longer with no signs of aggression coming from either side (the first instance was still asleep) , Agent ██████ decided that he wanted too see if these two instances could interact with each other somehow so he took some meat out from under his shirt and threw it over towards where both instances were sitting together near their bowls (<i>SCP-10713</i>'s original bowl had been knocked over during our initial attempt at trying too get closer too them without waking up either one). Both instances immediately turned around after hearing something land near them, but only one went over towards where Agent ██████ threw the meat while the other stayed put near their bowls like nothing happened even though there was now meat lying right next to them on top off their original bowls which should have woken both instances up due too how loud they were earlier when they were eating their own meals earlier while inside their cages back at Site ██ (we used soundproofing foam around our containment cells back there since most SCPs don't really care much about what's going on outside unless someone tries getting close enought othem that might be able to hurt them). But anyway after watching this second instance just sit there not moving an inch even though there now was some kind off meat laying right next t ohim instead off being thrown way across th eroom like Agent ██████ did earlier, I decided I wanted ta know why he wasn't going over towards where th eother agent did throw some kindoff meat onto th eground since I knew cats usually liked eating things that weren't normally found anywhere else besides nearby trees or bushes if you wanted something different than your regular old cat food diet every day since most cats can be picky eaters sometimes whenever you change what typeof kibble you giveth emor not givingth emanythingat allifyou don' tfeedthemanythingatallforalongperiodoftime(whichcanleadtodepressionincatsandtheycouldeventuallydieiftheydon' tgetanykindoffoodatalltoeataftera certain amountoftime passesby)butthisnewinstanceseemedlikehewasn' tinterestedinwhatweweredoingoverheresincehedidn' tyeturnaroundandlookatthemeatthatwasstill lyingthererightnexttohimasifhewantedtoeatitornotlikehis counterpartdidwhenhesawitlyingontopofftheiroriginalbowls earlierwhenwedecidedtotrygettingclosertoobothinstanceswithout wakingthemupsincewehadalreadywatchedthemforalongtimewhiletheywere sleepingandweknewthatneitheroneofthemwouldattackus oncewegotcloseenoughtoeachoneofthemwhilewewerewatchingthem sleep</div>
