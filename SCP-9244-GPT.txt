The object was found by two scouts from the local police department, who were investigating an anomaly caused by <i>SCP-9244</i>'s effect. The anomaly was detected when a 12 year old boy named Casey Larkin started imagining new types of weapons and gadgets for various purposes, and built them with ease.

But instead of becoming more intelligent and creative like most children would be, he started feeling violent thoughts towards other staff members and eventually tried to attack Dr S█████ but was quickly subdued by armed personnel nearby. Later inspection of his body showed that he had broken his left arm before being restrained due to the fact that it doesn't fit within the standard restraint methods available in the facility's armory.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9244.2 :</h3> Interview Log 9244-1<br><br>+<br>Interview Log 9244-1 -Hide Interview Log 9244-1 Interviewed: D-984<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr S█████<br><br><br>Foreword: The following interview is done after the incident on ██/██/2015.<br><br><Begin Log><br><br><br>Dr S█████: What happened exactly?
