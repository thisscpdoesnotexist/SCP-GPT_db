It has the appearance of a woman wearing a white dress with hot dog buns for sleeves and a mustard bottle for its head.<br><br>When it appears, <i>SCP-21094</i> will begin to sing in an unknown language that sounds like <i>"hotdoggity doggity"</i>. Any person within earshot of this song will become compelled to consume hot dogs at any cost. This compulsion can last up to several days or even weeks until all available hot dogs have been consumed by the affected individuals.<br><br>In addition, anyone who consumes food other than hot dogs while under the influence of <i>SCP-21094</i>'s song will suffer from extreme nausea and vomiting. The effects can be reversed by consuming more hot dogs or leaving the area where <i>SCP-21094</i> is present.<br><br><i>SCP-21094</i> appears to be able to move freely between locations without any apparent means of transportation; however, it cannot pass through solid objects such as walls or doors without first using some form of physical force against them. When attempting to breach these obstacles, it will often use its mustard bottle head as a battering ram before passing through them unharmed.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21094</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with soundproofing materials to prevent the spread of its song.<br><br>The area surrounding the containment cell must be monitored for any signs of <i>SCP-21094</i>'s presence, and personnel are to immediately report any sightings or activity related to it. In addition, all personnel assigned to work with <i>SCP-21094</i> must wear noise cancelling headphones while in its vicinity.<br><br>In order to prevent further outbreaks of hot dog consumption, Foundation agents are tasked with monitoring local hot dog stands and restaurants for any unusual activity or purchases that could indicate an outbreak caused by <i>SCP-21094</i>'s influence. Any such outbreaks should be reported immediately so<br><br><h3> Addendum 21094.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-21094</i> was encountered in the city of [REDACTED], where it had caused an outbreak of hot dog consumption. After being contained by Foundation personnel, it was transferred to Site-██ for further study and containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21094.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21094</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, Foundation personnel attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-21094</i> in order to learn more about its origin and purpose. The following is a transcript of the conversation that took place:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"What are you?"</i><br><b><br><i>SCP-21094</i>:</b> <i>"I am the goddess of hot dogs."</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"What is your purpose?"</i><br><b><br><i>SCP-21094</i>:</b> <i>"My purpose is to ensure that all who hear my song will never go without a hot dog."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 21094.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 21094-1<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-8432, a male human subject with no prior history of hot dog consumption.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-21094</i>'s containment chamber and remain there for one hour.
