What happened?<br><br>██████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>Well, I was walking around the forest when I saw something moving in the bushes, so I went over to check it out. It turned out to be a turtle that looked like it was made of glass or something. It stood up on its legs and started talking to me in English! The thing said it wanted help escaping from some people who were after it for some reason or another. So I agreed and we ran off into the woods together before they could find us! We ran for hours until we were deep in the forest before finding a cave that we hid in for days until they gave up looking for us! After that, we just spent our time together having fun and stuff… Until one day he told me he had to go away because people were after him again… He promised he would come back though… But then one day while I was sleeping with my back turned towards him, he disappeared without saying anything… He just left me all alone here in this cave… And now every night since then, there's been this weird noise coming from outside of my cave at night…. It sounds like a bunch of people whispering but whenever I try going out there during the day its always empty... Its really starting to scare me now.. Please help me..<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject expired due to unknown causes shortly after interview ended.
