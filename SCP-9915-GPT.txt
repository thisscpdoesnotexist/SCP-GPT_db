The garden has been in place for over 20 years and has never been maintained, yet it remains in perfect condition at all times.<br><br><i>SCP-9915</i> was discovered after multiple reports of the garden being <i>"too perfect"</i>. Foundation agents were able to trace the origin of these reports back to a local farmer who was attempting to sell his land. The farmer reported that he had no idea how or why his land had remained in such good condition despite not having any care taken towards it for years, nor did he know how the plants always remained fresh despite being exposed to harsh weather conditions and pollution from nearby factories.<br><br>A cover story about a wealthy investor funding an experimental project involving plant life was created, and <i>SCP-9915</i>'s anomalous properties have since gone unnoticed by the public. Due to its close proximity with major roads, <i>SCP-9915</i> is often used as an emergency food source for Foundation personnel during long term operations near Site 9915.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9915.2 : </h3>Interview with ??????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ?????? </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>?????? is a local farmer who discovered <i>SCP-9915</i> by chance. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, Mr. ??????, thank you for agreeing to this interview with us today. I have a few questions regarding the garden that was found on your land. ??????: Sure thing, go ahead and ask away! <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>First question; do you know why the plants in your garden are so healthy? They seem to be growing at an accelerated rate compared to other plants nearby… ??????: Well it's not really my place to say, but I think it has something to do with the way they're planted… You see most of my neighbors plant their crops in rows or patches like normal people would but I figured that since my land is so big , I'd just plant them all over the place like any normal vegetable garden would be! (laughs) It's worked out pretty well for me too! I've had more than enough food from what little work I put into it! That's why they call me <i>"The King of Corn"</i> around here! (laughs) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears as though <i>SCP-9915</i> was created by accident due to farmers attempting new methods of farming in order to increase crop yield without having much success until Mr. ??????? began planting his crops randomly without caring where they were placed . The reason behind this method being successful remains unknown at this time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9915.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 9915-01:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9915</i> was planted with a single potato seed. The seed was taken from the same batch of seeds used to plant a control garden located at Site 9915.<br><br><b>Results: </b>One potato sprouted in <i>SCP-9915</i>, and remained in perfect condition for over 2 months before wilting and dying. A second potato sprouted soon after, but did not remain fresh for as long as the previous one had. The second sprout died within a week of being planted, while the first one lasted over 2 months. It is worth noting that both potatoes produced were identical in appearance to each other and to those grown from the control garden . Experiment <br><br><b>9915-02: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-9915</i> was planted with two different types of squash seeds (Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita mixta). <br><br><b>Results: </b>Two different types of squash grew out of <i>SCP-9915</i>, both identical to those grown from the control garden . Experiment 9915-03 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A variety of vegetables were planted in <i>SCP-9915</i> along with several pieces of fruit tree saplings (Prunus sp.). <br><br><b>Results: </b>All vegetables remained fresh despite exposure to harsh weather conditions for over 8 weeks before wilting and dying. Fruit trees began growing soon after being placed into soil; however, none bore fruit or leaves despite having been doused with water daily for 3 weeks straight. All saplings expired within 4 days without any noticeable cause or reason why they expired so quickly . Experiment 9916 -04 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Several varieties of flowers were planted in <i>SCP-9916</i> along with several pieces of fruit tree saplings (Prunus sp.). <br><br><b>Results: </b>Flowers remained fresh despite exposure to harsh weather conditions for over 8 weeks before wilting and dying . Fruit trees began growing soon after being placed into soil; however, none bore fruit or leaves despite having been doused with water daily for 3 weeks straight. All saplings expired within 4 days without any noticeable cause or reason why they expired so quickly . Addendum -09/23/20███ Following numerous complaints about <i>"the smell"</i> coming from Site 9916 , it has since been discovered that all plants have begun emitting an odor similar to rotten feces when exposed even slightly to rainwater during rainstorms lasting longer than 5 minutes at a time.. Further investigation revealed that this is due entirely due to chemicals emitted by plant life which are normally not present unless plants have begun decomposing on their own , causing them further concern about how this could be possible under normal circumstances without causing any sort of contamination issues at Site 9916 if left unchecked..</div>
