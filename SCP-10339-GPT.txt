I'm glad you could make it on such short notice today; we have a few questions for you regarding your recent transformation at CES 2017 last week… <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Yeah, yeah, sure thing doc; I've been meaning to talk to somebody about that anyway… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Excellent! So then let's begin with what happened at the event itself; do you remember anything out of the ordinary happening? Mr.: Well… (Mr .████████ pauses for several moments.) I had just gotten off stage from my keynote speech when this guy comes up to me and asks if he can have a picture taken with me or something like that . He seemed nice enough so I agreed , and we took a selfie together . Then he tells me that there's some sort of party going on in one of the suites upstairs , but he'd be happy to take me there instead if I wanted . At this point , honestly , it was pretty late and all so I just said sure why not ? We got back into an elevator together with two other people who were already in there ; one was an attractive girl who looked like she might be around my age , while the other was an older man wearing some kind of weird costume … (Mr .████████ pauses again.) Wait a minute … now that you mention it , they did seem kind of suspicious … but they didn't look dangerous or anything so it didn't really bother me too much at first … anyway we get up to this suite and everyone starts drinking right away ; turns out they're all partiers from Mardi Gras or something like that . The girl even gave me her number before she left ! Anyway after about half an hour or so everybody decides its time for bed ; apparently their rooms are all full but mine is free because the hotel overbooked or something like that ? So we go down another hallway into another room where a bunch more people are sleeping on beds set up along either side ; turns out most if not all these people were strangers as well ! But again no harm no foul right ? And then… (Mr .████████ pauses yet again.) Oh god damnit ! Now i remember why those guys looked familiar! They're those fucking idiots from /r/incels ! Those fuckers tried messaging me once before when they found out who i am through one my old tweets about feminism being bullshit ! And now here they are trying their damnedest to get into bed with ME?! Fuck them! Fuck them all! Dr.. Okay sir calm down please; nobody is accusing you here okay? You're not in trouble here okay? Just take some deep breaths for us.. That's better…. Where were we? Oh yes .. So then what happened next? Mr.: Well uhm… (At this point Mr..████████ appears visibly shaken .) Uhmm…. It wasn't rape exactly…..but……I mean……(At this point tears begin streaming down his face .) Fuck……I mean…..they kept saying stuff like <i>"You don't need any feminist cunts ruining your life"</i>…..and <i>"Don't let women control your life"</i>…………and…………(He begins sobbing heavily)……………………………………………………………………………………………………….(At this point <i>SCP-10339</i> transforms back into Elon Musk .) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After approximately twenty minutes <i>SCP-10339</i> transformed back into Elon Musk as per usual procedure following interviews involving its containment unit since becoming <i>SCP-10339</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 10339.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10339-1:<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10339</i> is to be shown a television playing the film <i>"Ratatouille"</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-10339</i> vocalized in what appeared to be a mix of surprise and disgust.
