<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-20851 is  the unstoppable marching of time, slowly leading us all to an inevitable death. we are the sheep and time is the shepherd; nothing we do matters and all will be forgotten.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20851<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20851</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that causes time to progress exponentially faster in its presence. All living organisms and non-living objects within a 5 km radius of the anomaly are affected, with the rate of time increasing by a factor of 10 for each second spent within its area of effect.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-20851</i> are permanent, and any attempts to slow down or reverse its effects have been unsuccessful. The only known way to stop it is through complete removal from the area.<br><br>Once exposed to <i>SCP-20851</i>, individuals will age rapidly until they reach their natural life expectancy at which point they will die instantly. Non-living objects such as buildings and vehicles will also suffer accelerated wear and tear due to the accelerated passage of time, leading them to eventually become unusable after prolonged exposure.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20851</i> is to be contained within a 5 km radius area of effect, surrounded by a containment wall. Any personnel entering the area must wear protective gear and be monitored at all times.<br><br>Any attempts to breach the containment wall or enter the anomaly's area of effect without authorization will be met with lethal force. All personnel entering the anomaly's area of effect are required to sign waivers acknowledging that they understand and accept the risks associated with exposure to <i>SCP-20851</i>.<br><br>In order to minimize damage caused by <i>SCP-20851</i>, periodic maintenance must be conducted on any structures located within its area of effect. This includes regular inspections for signs of accelerated wear and tear as well as repairs when necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20851.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to study the effects of <i>SCP-20851</i> on living organisms by placing several lab rats within its area of effect. The results were catastrophic; all the rats died instantly due to accelerated aging. It was determined that any attempts to study <i>SCP-20851</i> in this way would be highly unethical and thus discontinued.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20851.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, what can you tell me about <i>SCP-20851</i>?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Well, it's an anomaly that causes time to progress exponentially faster in its presence. It affects all living organisms and non-living objects within a 5 km radius of the anomaly, with the rate of time increasing by a factor of 10 for each second spent within its area of effect. The effects are permanent and cannot be reversed or slowed down in any way.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> What kind of damage can it cause?<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Any living organisms exposed to <i>SCP-20851</i> will age rapidly until they reach their natural life expectancy at which point they will die instantly. Non-living objects such as buildings and vehicles will also suffer accelerated wear and tear due to the accelerated passage of time, leading them to eventually become unusable after prolonged exposure.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20851.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> A single human subject was exposed to <i>SCP-20851</i> for 10 minutes. Upon the conclusion of the experiment, it was observed that the subject had aged approximately 20 years and died shortly after.<br><b><br>Experiment 2:</b> A single human subject was exposed to <i>SCP-20851</i> for 30 minutes. Upon the conclusion of the experiment, it was observed that the subject had aged approximately 60 years and died shortly after.<br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> It is concluded that exposure to <i>SCP-20851</i> will cause rapid aging in living organisms until they reach their natural life expectancy at which point they will die instantly.</div>
