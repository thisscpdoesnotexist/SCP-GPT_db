Physical objects, such as rocks, trees, and buildings will become sexually attractive to people affected by <i>SCP-25470</i>. Conversely, people affected by <i>SCP-25470</i> will become physically attracted to other people.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-25470</i> are not limited to human beings; animals and plants can also be affected. In addition, inanimate objects can also become sexually attractive under the influence of this anomaly. <br><br><i>SCP-25470</i>'s area of effect is limited; it only affects those within a certain radius from its origin point (determined through experimentation). The exact range is unknown but appears to be approximately 500 meters in all directions from the origin point. <br><br>Attempts at containing or reversing this anomaly have been unsuccessful so far due to its unpredictable nature and rapid spread rate when left unchecked. As such, containment procedures focus on minimizing public exposure and preventing further spread by monitoring areas where manifestations of <i>SCP-25470</i> have occurred for any signs of new outbreaks or potential carriers who may unknowingly spread the anomaly further afield. Any individuals found exhibiting symptoms must be contained immediately for observation until they no longer show any signs or evidence of being influenced by this phenomenon before release back into society with amnestics administered if necessary.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-25470</i>, containment is focused on minimizing public exposure and preventing further spread.

A research team was dispatched to investigate the origin point and discovered that it had originated from an abandoned warehouse located on the outskirts of town. The warehouse was found to contain various anomalous artifacts which are believed to have been responsible for this outbreak. All items were confiscated and taken into Foundation custody for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25470.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> Dr. ██████, head researcher of <i>SCP-25470</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> So what have you discovered about this phenomenon?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> We've been able to determine that the origin point of <i>SCP-25470</i> is a small town in [REDACTED]. We believe it began there and then spread outward from there, affecting more people as it went along until it reached its current range of 500 meters in all directions from the origin point. We've also determined that the effects are not permanent; they wear off after a certain amount of time, usually around 24 hours or less depending on an individual's proximity to the origin point.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Are there any methods of containing or reversing this anomaly?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Unfortunately, due to its unpredictable nature and rapid spread rate when left unchecked, we haven't been able to develop any effective containment measures as of yet. We are still researching possible causes and origins in order to develop more effective containment protocols in the future.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25470.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 25470.3-1:</b> <br><b>Subjects:</b> D-25471 and D-25472<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subjects were instructed to enter a room with a large rock in the center of it. <br><b>Results:</b> Both subjects became physically attracted to the rock, attempting to caress and embrace it. After several minutes, they began to display signs of arousal before being removed from the room.</div>
