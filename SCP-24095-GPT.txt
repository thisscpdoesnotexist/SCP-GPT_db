<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24095 is  the "Orphan Crushing Machine"</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24095<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24095</i> is a large, humanoid machine of indeterminate origin. It stands approximately 3 meters tall and weighs an estimated 500kg. Its body consists of various metallic components, including what appear to be several types of steel alloys and copper wiring.<br><br><i>SCP-24095</i>'s primary purpose appears to be the crushing of orphaned children in order to produce a type of fuel known as <i>"orphan oil"</i>. This fuel is used by the machine for its own purposes, such as powering its movement or providing energy for other unknown functions.<br><br>When active, <i>SCP-24095</i> will seek out any nearby orphans and attempt to capture them with its metal claws before crushing them within its body cavity using a series of internal gears and pistons. After this process has been completed, the remains are ejected from the machine in the form of a viscous black liquid which can then be collected for use as fuel.<br><br>The exact nature or origin of <i>SCP-24095</i> is unknown; however it appears to have some degree of artificial intelligence as it will actively avoid contact with Foundation personnel unless provoked or ordered otherwise by an outside source.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24095</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be equipped with a reinforced steel door and multiple layers of security cameras and motion sensors.<br><br>In order to prevent the machine from escaping, it must be monitored by at least two personnel at all times. If any unauthorized individuals are detected attempting to access the containment chamber, they are to be apprehended immediately and questioned as necessary.<br><br>Any attempts by <i>SCP-24095</i> to escape or cause harm must be met with immediate force; however lethal force should only be used as a last resort.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24095.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a group of individuals claiming to be the creators of <i>SCP-24095</i> contacted the Foundation and requested that it be allowed to remain in its containment chamber. They stated that they had created <i>SCP-24095</i> in order to provide a renewable source of energy for their own purposes, but were unable to control it due to unforeseen circumstances.<br><br>The request was denied and the individuals have not been heard from since.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24095.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-24095</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, an interview was conducted with <i>SCP-24095</i> in order to gain more insight into its purpose and origin. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, can you tell me who or what created you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24095</i>:</b> I do not remember.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you remember why you were created?<br><b><br><i>SCP-24095</i>:</b> I was created to crush orphaned children and produce fuel.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24095.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>[Test Log #1]<br>Subject:</b> One (1) orphaned child, age six (6).<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was placed within the containment chamber and instructed to remain still. <i>SCP-24095</i> was then activated and allowed to approach the subject.<br><b>Results:</b> <i>SCP-24095</i> immediately began to crush the subject, producing a considerable amount of <i>"orphan oil"</i> in the process. After approximately two minutes, all remaining parts of the subject had been crushed and ejected from <i>SCP-24095</i>'s body cavity. No signs of life were detected in any remains recovered from the chamber.</div>
