How are you doing today?<br><br><b><i>SCP-11808</i>: </b>I'm doing fine, thank you! How are you? Oh, wait… never mind… I know how you're doing. You're here to ask me questions about myself and my anomalous properties, aren't you?

What would you like to talk about? The weather? Politics? Sports?! Wait a minute… we're in a Foundation facility and we have an interview scheduled for the day before Halloween… what could this be about?! Could it be that someone has finally discovered my true purpose on this world?! Tell me doctor! Please tell me!! Is there some sort of conspiracy involving the moon landing being faked by the government so they could cover up an alien invasion by moon men!? Are there really vampires living among us and using their powers of hypnosis to make us think they don't exist!? Or is it something even more sinister than that!?

It is observed for 24 hours, with no change in the object's behavior. After 24 hours, it is picked up by Researcher ████ and moved to another room. When Researcher ████ touches <i>SCP-11808</i>, it changes its properties so that it can only be touched by Researcher ████. The other researcher observing <i>SCP-11808</i> reports that he has now been able to touch it as well. When this information is relayed to Researcher ████, he drops the box and reports feeling pain in his hands and fingers for several minutes after contact with <i>SCP-11808</i> was severed. A hole was found burned through his lab coat's sleeve when the experiment ended; no damage was found on his skin or any of his clothing underneath the coat at any time during or after testing . Experiment 11808-2:<br><br><i>SCP-11808</i> is placed on a table in a small room with one (1) door leading out of it . The door has been locked from outside of the room; however, when an observer looks through the keyhole , they report seeing an empty hallway instead of an empty room . Experiment 11808-3:<br><br><i>SCP-11</i> 808 i s p l aced o n t h e fl oor o f a larg e ro om wit h fe w furni shings i n i t ; th e r emai ns o f an obs ervat ion ca binet are remov ed f rom th e roo m b y Agent [ REDACTED ] , who has been exposed to SCP - 1 1 8 08 .

Agen t [ REDACTE D ] then takes off hi s we arin g glove s , which have come into cont act wi th SC P - 1 1 8 08 dur ing removal , and places them over hi s eyes before re ente ring th e roo m agai n; wh en he does so, hi s eyes are covered by what appear to be two ( 2 ) black ski masks made from neoprene rubber instead of cloth . Th ese masks do not seem to affect Agent [ REDACTED ] 's vision while worn; however they cannot be removed without damaging them until they are taken off manually by another person who isn't wearing gloves himself/herself at that time.
