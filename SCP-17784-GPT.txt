The process involves the subject being placed in a chamber and exposed to an unknown energy source. This energy source causes the subject to convert into a .txt file, which can then be read and edited before being converted back into an organic form.<br><br>The exact nature of the energy source is currently unknown, but it appears to be related to quantum mechanics. It has been theorized that this is due to its ability to manipulate reality on a subatomic level.<br><br>The process of conversion takes approximately one minute, with no ill effects on the subject upon return from their conversion state. However, any changes made while in .txt form will become permanent upon reconversion; this includes physical alterations as well as memories or personality traits that were modified during editing of the file. As such, extreme caution must be taken when using <i>SCP-17784</i> for any purpose other than research or experimentation purposes approved by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>It should also be noted that <i>SCP-17784</i> does not appear capable of converting non-organic matter into .txt files; attempts at doing so have resulted in failure and destruction of whatever was attempted to be converted instead.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17784</i> is to be kept in a secure storage locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17784</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher, and any experiments involving the use of <i>SCP-17784</i> must be approved by the Site Director.<br><br>Any subjects that are converted into .txt files via <i>SCP-17784</i> are to be monitored for any changes made while in their .txt form, and all changes must be documented and reported immediately. Any physical alterations made during conversion must also be noted and treated accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17784.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17784</i> on non-human organisms. A sample of canine DNA was placed in the conversion chamber, and exposed to the energy source. The sample converted into a .txt file as expected, but upon reconversion it had been altered significantly; instead of returning as a dog, it returned as an anomalous creature resembling a cross between a dog and an owl.<br><br>The creature has since been designated <i>SCP-17784</i>-A, and is currently contained at Site-██.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17784.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17784</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17784</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me what the purpose of <i>SCP-17784</i> is?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17784</i>:</b> The purpose of <i>SCP-17784</i> is to convert organic matter into .txt files, which can then be read and edited before reconversion back into its original form.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Are there any risks associated with using <i>SCP-17784</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17784</i>:</b> Yes, there are some risks associated with using <i>SCP-17784</i>. Any changes made to the .txt file while it is in its converted form will become permanent upon reconversion; this includes physical alterations as well as memories or personality traits that were modified during editing of the file. As such, extreme caution must be taken when using <i>SCP-17784</i> for any purpose other than research or experimentation purposes approved by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17784.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 17784-1:</b> A human subject was placed in the conversion chamber and exposed to the energy source. The subject was successfully converted into a .txt file and reconverted back into an organic form with no ill effects. No changes were made to the file during editing, so no alterations were observed upon reconversion.<br><b><br>Experiment 17784-2:</b> A canine subject was placed in the conversion chamber and exposed to the energy source. The subject was successfully converted into a .txt file and reconverted back into an organic form with no ill effects. However, minor physical alterations were observed upon reconversion; specifically, fur color changed from brown to white as well as increased size of ears compared to before conversion. These changes are assumed to have been made while in .txt form due to editing of the file by personnel involved in experiment 17784-2</div>
