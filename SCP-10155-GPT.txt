When they saw <i>SCP-10155</i> they thought it was just an ordinary rat so they tried to catch it but when one of them tried to grab for it he had his hand bitten off by <i>SCP-10155</i>. The group then ran away from the house and called the police who then came and contained <i>SCP-10155</i> and brought it back to Site 17 where Dr ██████ did an interview with him.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent [REDACTED] </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Agent: </b>So you are Dr ██████? Dr: Yes I am, what can I do for you? <br><br><b>Agent: </b>We have a rat here that we need help identifying what kind he is or if he's even real? Dr: Well let me see him then! Agent hands over cage containing 1015 into the room with them both in there> Alright now what's this about this thing being able to fly?! <br><br><b>Agent: </b>Well we aren't sure if its real or not but all we know is that our men couldn't get near this thing without having their hand bitten off! And when one of them did try grabbing for it, the thing flew into his face at high speed! It also seems like its immune to bullets as well since none have managed hitting this thing yet! So please tell us how can we kill something nobody knows anything about!? <Dr opens up cage containing 1015> What are you doing?! That could be dangerous!! <Dr takes out 1015> (Screaming) AHHHHH!!! MY HAND!!! MY HAND!!! AGENT (Grabbing gun): Sorry doctor but your services will no longer be needed here… Goodbye… *Agent fires bullet into head* End Log<br><br><h3>Addendum 10155.1 : </h3> <i>SCP-10155</i> was found in ████████, ████████ by a group of people who were going through old houses that were abandoned after [DATA EXPUNGED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 10155.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 10155.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10155-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10155</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10155</i> was told to fly into a wall at full speed. After which it was to be placed in a box and the box was to be crushed with a hydraulic press. The remains of the subject were then to be examined for any abnormalities.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject flew into wall at speeds of up to 200mph, but after hitting the wall it fell down unconscious and died shortly afterwards due to head trauma. When subject's remains were examined there were no abnormalities found on them, except for some minor bone fractures that are common when an animal dies from blunt force trauma. Experiment <br><br><b>10155-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10155</i> <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A large block of ice was made and then placed in front of an open fire so that it would melt faster than normal while being filmed by CCTV cameras. The melted water from the ice block would then be collected and put into another container where it would freeze again forming another block of ice with different dimensions than before, this process would continue until all water had turned into solid ice blocks with dimensions similar to that of <i>SCP-10155</i>'s cage (10x10x5 meters). The cage itself is made out of steel coated with rubber so that if anything comes in contact with it they will not get hurt or die from electrocution (See Addendum 1015). <br><br><b>Results: </b>After about 40 minutes all water had turned into solid ice blocks which were then moved over towards <i>SCP-10155</i>'s cage where he would try flying through them at full speed but every time he does this his body will go straight through them without being damaged or harmed whatsoever just like if they weren't even there at all! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It seems like we have discovered something new here today! We now know that this thing is immune against physical attacks as well as heat based attacks! We also know now how these things can fly so fast without getting tired since they are immune against heat based attacks! This could mean great things for us here in Site 17!! - Dr ██████</div>
