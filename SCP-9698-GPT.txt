It was in the bathroom when I bought the house from my parents a few years ago now…I guess they forgot about it or something…anyway I just used it for cleaning and stuff and never really thought much of it until now…<br><br><b> Dr. ████:</b> And why did you report its anomalous properties to us if that's all you were using it for?<br><br><b> Mr. ██████:</b> Well after reading up on some of your other stuff I figured that maybe someone else could use this little guy here! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><b> Closing Statement:</b> After being informed of its anomalous properties, Mr. [REDACTED] became very distressed and refused any further questioning regarding <i>SCP-9698</i><br><br><h3><br><br><b>Addendum 9698.2 :</b></h3> <i>SCP-9698</i> Experiment Log<br><br><b>Experiment 9698-1:</b> D-923 was instructed to use <i>SCP-9698</i> to clean a table. After cleaning the table, D-923 reported that the paper had run out. The table was then cleaned with a standard roll of toilet paper and no anomalies were found.<br><br><b>Experiment 9698-2:</b> A standard roll of toilet paper was used to clean a table. When the roll ran out, it was replaced with <i>SCP-9698</i> and it continued working as normal. When the second roll ran out, it too was replaced with <i>SCP-9698</i> and continued working as normal. This repeated until all rolls of toilet paper in Site ██ were replaced with <i>SCP-9698</i> without any anomalous effects occurring. It is believed that this test proves that <i>SCP-9698</i> can be used indefinitely without running out of paper or causing any other anomalous effects to occur .</div>
