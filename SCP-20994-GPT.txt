The beach has a length of approximately 3 kilometers and is composed of white sand.<br><br>The anomalous properties of <i>SCP-20994</i> manifest when any human subject enters the area, regardless of their age. Upon entering, subjects will immediately experience a decrease in age by one year for every minute they remain within the boundaries of <i>SCP-20994</i>. This effect does not appear to be limited to humans; any living creature that steps onto the beach will experience this effect as well, though at varying rates depending on species and size.<br><br>Once subjects reach an age lower than 25 years old, they will begin to rapidly de-age until reaching infancy or death due to complications caused by extreme aging reversal (such as organ failure). Subjects who manage to leave before reaching such an advanced stage are able to resume normal aging processes after exiting the anomaly's area of influence.<br><br>It should be noted that while all individuals affected by <i>SCP-20994</i> have been observed exhibiting signs characteristic of younger ages (such as increased energy levels, improved physical capabilities, etc.), none have reported experiencing any memories from earlier stages in life nor have exhibited any change in personality or behavior beyond those expected from someone their new apparent age would suggest. Furthermore, no evidence suggesting that time travel has occurred has been found so far; rather it appears that individuals simply “skip” certain stages in life without being aware of having done so until informed about it afterwards or upon leaving the anomaly's influence zone..<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-20994</i> is to be monitored by a team of Foundation personnel stationed on the island. All access to the beach is restricted and any unauthorized individuals attempting to enter are to be detained and questioned.<br><br>In order to prevent potential misuse of <i>SCP-20994</i>, all personnel assigned to the site are required to wear protective gear at all times while in its vicinity. Additionally, no individual under 25 years old is allowed within 500 meters of the anomaly's area of influence without prior authorization from a Level 4 or higher staff member.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20994.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a research team was dispatched to <i>SCP-20994</i> in order to investigate the anomaly's effects on non-human lifeforms. The results of this experiment can be found in Document 20994.1<br><br><h3> Addendum 20994.2: </h3> Interview with Subject #20994-1<br><b><br>Subject:</b> ████ ███████, a 25 year old male.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Foreword:</b> The following is a transcript of an interview conducted with the first subject to enter <i>SCP-20994</i>. Subject was informed about the anomalous properties of the beach prior to entering.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> So, tell me about your experience on the beach.<br><b><br>Subject #20994-1:</b> Well, it was… strange. I remember feeling really young all of a sudden and my body felt different too. I guess it was like being a kid again but without any of the memories or anything like that. It was kind of weird but also kind of nice in a way.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Interesting, did you feel any other changes? Any physical or mental ones?<br><b><br>Subject #20994-1:</b> Yeah, I did actually! My reflexes seemed to be faster than usual and my energy levels were higher too; it almost felt like I had more stamina than before. I also felt a bit more optimistic and cheerful, like nothing could bring me down.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> That's definitely an interesting phenomenon. Do you think it had anything to do with the age reversal?<br><b><br>Subject #20994-1:</b> Maybe, but I'm not sure. It was kind of hard to tell since everything happened so quickly and all at once; it almost felt like I was in a dream or something.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I see. Do you think the experience was worth it?<br><b><br>Subject #20994-1:</b> Yeah, definitely. It was a really unique and fun experience; I'm glad I got to try it out!<br><br><h3> Addendum 20994.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to test the effects of <i>SCP-20994</i> on humans. A team of five researchers were chosen for this purpose and instructed to enter the anomaly's area of influence and remain there for a period of two hours. During this time, all subjects experienced a decrease in age by 24 years, reaching the age of 1 year old at the end of it. All subjects were then extracted from the beach and monitored as they resumed normal aging processes. No adverse side effects have been reported so far.</div>
