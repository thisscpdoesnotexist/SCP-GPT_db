<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-22366 is  Mars replica planet with a orange ring like eye it shoots out a super gamma ray in random directions and have a high chance of hitting earth</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-22366<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Thaumiel<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-22366</i> is a replica of the planet Mars, located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. It has an orange ring around it which appears to be composed of an unknown material, resembling a giant eye.<br><br><i>SCP-22366</i> periodically emits gamma rays in random directions with high intensity and accuracy, capable of reaching Earth's atmosphere. These gamma rays have been observed to cause significant damage to structures and organisms on Earth's surface if they are not intercepted by other objects in space or dissipated by the atmosphere before reaching the surface.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-22366</i> is currently unknown; however, its anomalous properties suggest that it was created artificially for some purpose yet to be determined.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-22366</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation satellites. Any gamma rays emitted by <i>SCP-22366</i> must be intercepted and neutralized before they reach Earth's atmosphere.<br><br>In the event of a gamma ray reaching Earth, personnel are to immediately deploy countermeasures to minimize damage and casualties. Personnel are also to investigate the source of the gamma ray in order to determine if it was generated by <i>SCP-22366</i> or another anomalous entity.<br><br>Research into the origin and purpose of <i>SCP-22366</i> is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22366.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, the Foundation received a transmission from <i>SCP-22366</i>. The message was in an unknown language, but analysis of the signal revealed that it contained instructions on how to construct a device capable of controlling <i>SCP-22366</i>'s gamma ray emission.<br><br>Analysis is ongoing into the purpose and origin of this device.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22366.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-22366</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, an interview was conducted with <i>SCP-22366</i> in order to determine its purpose. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-22366</i>. Can you tell us why you were created?<br><b><br><i>SCP-22366</i>:</b> I do not know who or what created me, but I believe that my purpose is to protect Earth from hostile forces. My gamma rays are meant to destroy any threats before they can reach Earth's surface and cause harm.<br><br><h3> Addendum 22366.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment 22366.3 was conducted to determine the source of <i>SCP-22366</i>'s gamma rays and their potential effects on Earth.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> A Foundation satellite was deployed to a position approximately 1 million kilometers from <i>SCP-22366</i>, where it collected data on the origin, intensity, and direction of gamma rays emitted by the object. In addition, personnel were dispatched to locations that had been hit by gamma rays in order to assess any damage or casualties caused by them.<br><b><br>Results:</b> The data collected from Experiment 22366.3 indicated that all gamma rays originating from <i>SCP-22366</i> were directed towards Earth and that they had enough energy to cause significant destruction if not intercepted or dissipated before reaching the surface. Furthermore, personnel dispatched to affected areas reported widespread destruction and numerous casualties as a result of these gamma ray attacks.</div>
