He has been known to have a humanoid form but can also take on the form of water or any other liquids he wants.<br><br><i>SCP-16878</i> was found in ██████, California when police officers were called in for a disturbance at an apartment complex. When police arrived they saw <i>SCP-16878</i> changing into different liquids and then back into his humanoid form again. Police tried shooting him with their standard issue firearms but it did not seem to phase him as he continued his rampage through the complex until police were forced to retreat from the building due to low ammunition supplies. After a few minutes <i>SCP-16878</i> stopped and returned back into his humanoid form before leaving out of one of the windows on the second floor of the building by turning himself into water and falling down onto one of the cars parked outside while changing back into his humanoid form again before walking away from where he landed on top of one car before going around another car that was parked next door before getting in it with no driver inside then driving off down an alleyway after stopping at some traffic lights that were red which caused him some trouble as they stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as he had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for them light up green so he could continue driving down this road until reaching an intersection where there was no traffic lights but still had stop signs present so once again had some difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that he could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as he had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that he could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as she had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that she could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards you.<i>"<br><br><h3>Addendum 16878.1 : </h3>_________<br><br><h3>Addendum 16878.2 : </h3>Interview with _________<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> _________ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> _________ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>_________: </b>Hello <i>SCP-16878</i>, can you hear me? <br><br><b><i>SCP-16878</i>: </b>Yes.

So what do you want? <br><br><b>_________: </b>Well, we would like to ask you a few questions about your life before we brought you here and why it was wrong for what happened that day in ██████, California when police officers were called in for a disturbance at an apartment complex when they saw you changing into different liquids then back into your humanoid form again before walking away from where he landed on top of one car before going around another car that was parked next door before getting in it with no driver inside then driving off down an alleyway after stopping at some traffic lights that were red which caused him some trouble as they stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as he had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for them light up green so he could continue driving down this road until reaching an intersection where there was no traffic lights but still had stop signs present so once again had some difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that he could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as he had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that he could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them which caused him more trouble than usual as she had difficulty trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that she could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when the lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards them."</i> (<i>SCP-16878</i> starts laughing) <br><br><b><i>SCP-16878</i>: </b>Hahahaha! That is hilarious! You people are funny sometimes! (<i>SCP-16878</i> stops laughing) But anyway… What do YOU want? Why did those cops shoot me with their guns? They didn't hurt me at all! It's almost impossible to hurt someone made out of water! If they shot me with bullets made out of ice or something else cold enough maybe then I would have been hurt by those bullets but regular bullets won't work against someone who is made out of water since water won't freeze until it reaches 32 degrees Fahrenheit (-0.5 degrees Celsius). Also how did the police know about my little rampage through the apartment complex? Did someone call 911 and tell the police about my rampage through the apartments and how I turned myself into different liquids and how this person thought it wasn't normal behavior since most humans don't turn themselves into different liquids during their rampages through buildings? Or did one of those cops see my rampage himself and reported back afterwards telling his superiors about what happened during his shift today on duty and told his superiors everything except how things went down exactly due to being too embarrassed because this cop couldn't handle taking care of business himself by shooting a rampaging human being who turned himself into different liquids during his rampage through buildings instead making things worse by doing nothing except calling 911 instead of shooting said rampaging human being who turned himself into different liquids during his rampage through buildings causing a bigger mess later on after said cop left work due to wanting nothing else but leaving work early because knowing full well if staying late meant doing something stupid such as calling 911 instead of shooting said rampaging human being who turned himself into different liquids during his rampage through buildings causing a bigger mess later on after said cop left work due to wanting nothing else but leaving work early because knowing full well if staying late meant doing something stupid such as calling 911 instead of shooting said rampaging human being who turned himself into different liquids during his rampage through buildings causing a bigger mess later on after said cop left work due to wanting nothing else but leaving work early because knowing full well if staying late meant doing something stupid such as calling 911 instead of shooting said rampaging human being who turned herself [sic] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After interviewing <i>SCP-16878</i> we now know why those cops didn't shoot him with their guns since according to <i>SCP-16878</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 16878.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 16878-5:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-16878</i>, D-11412.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-11412 is to be instructed on how to use <i>SCP-16878</i>'s object that can help him escape from the facility. After this has been done, D-11412 will be instructed on how to use his new found knowledge and then let loose in the facility with no supervision. Security cameras will be placed around the facility so that we can monitor what he does while he's out of our sight. He is not allowed to leave the site unless given permission by a level 3 or higher personnel and only if told where he can go off site and what he should do when there. If any personnel are attacked by him they are allowed to defend themselves but are not allowed to kill him as we need him alive for further testing purposes.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After being released into the facility, <i>SCP-16878</i> was seen walking around until coming across an office room where Dr ████ was working at his desk writing up some reports while listening to music through headphones which caused <i>SCP-16878</i> some problems as it made it difficult for him hearing Dr ████ talking about how much of a nuisance that SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED] has been recently before getting up from his desk and walking over towards Dr ████ who stopped talking about this nuisance before turning off his music player after noticing something behind him which caused Dr ████ turn around quickly in shock before seeing that it was just D-[DATA EXPUNGED] standing there looking at them both with no expression on their face which caused Dr ████ look back at [DATA EXPUNGED] before asking them why they're here until [DATA EXPUNGED] started talking about how hard it is trying not hitting anything while waiting for these stop signs light up green so that she could continue driving straight ahead without having any problems like earlier when these lights stayed red even though there was no traffic coming towards you."<br><br></div>
