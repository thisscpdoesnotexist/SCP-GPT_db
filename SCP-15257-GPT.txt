Any person who dies after watching <i>SCP-15257</i> must immediately undergo autopsy and cremation; if this cannot be done due to lack of resources, they must instead be buried in an unmarked grave at least one kilometer away from any populated area or living thing other than plants that require no contact with soil in order for them to survive (e.g., cacti). Due care should be taken when handling the remains of anyone who has died after watching <i>SCP-15257</i>; all such remains should either immediately undergo incineration or burial as described above, depending on whether they are still intact enough for incineration or not. If there are no available resources with which to cremate or bury these remains (again due primarily but not exclusively to lack of space), then they should instead remain where they were found until such time as sufficient resources can become available for disposal; this disposal may take weeks or months depending on available resources (see Incident Report 15457/A). However, it is imperative that all contaminated materials related directly or indirectly—but most especially directly—to viewing instances of <i>SCP-15258</i> never come into contact with living human beings unless said materials are being used in experiments designed specifically for studying them (see Addendum 15458/B).

I'd like to ask you some questions about the incident with your employee, if you don't mind? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>No problem at all sir, go right ahead! I'm an open book! (laughs) Dr. ███: Thank you for your cooperation in this matter; now then—can you tell me what happened? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Of course! It's not every day that one of my employees dies in such a mysterious way! (laughs) So anyway… as far as I can tell, she just watched SuperSports for fifteen minutes and then keeled over dead on her couch; no warning signs or anything like that at all… it was really quite shocking to hear about it! What really got me though was how long she'd been watching SuperSports before she died; apparently she started watching it around 11AM yesterday morning and didn't stop until 1PM or so when someone went into her apartment and found her lying there dead on the couch… so that's three hours straight without any breaks at all… not even bathroom breaks or anything like that… which is pretty impressive if you ask me! (laughs) She must have really loved sports to put up with something like that for three whole hours straight without taking a break once—I mean who wouldn't get tired after sitting through something like SuperSports for more than fifteen minutes? Not only is it extremely boring but there are also commercials every thirty seconds—it's torture to watch sometimes if I'm being honest with myself here (laughs), but still somehow people manage to do it anyway despite knowing how bad the programming quality is most of the time…. Anyway though, getting back on track here…. So yeah basically we're dealing with an unknown virus or disease here; nothing out of the ordinary considering how many viruses are floating around out there nowadays thanks largely in part due to global warming and climate change—the world is becoming a much more dangerous place these days than ever before because of things like this happening all over the place lately…. And yet despite having no idea what caused this woman's death other than knowing it had something to do with SuperSports somehow we still managed to cover up everything related directly or indirectly—but most especially directly —to viewing instances of <i>SCP-15258</i> from public knowledge by making up some story about an unknown virus killing people who watch too much TV shows involving sports regardless whether they're live broadcasts or recorded programs playing back later via DVRs etcetera ad nauseam…. Now granted maybe we could have gotten away with telling everyone exactly what happened instead but where would be the fun in doing something so boring when we could instead make up an interesting cover story instead one which makes us look good while also keeping civilians from panicking unnecessarily over nothing?
