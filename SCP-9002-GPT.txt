SCP-9002 has several points of interest that are not on the actual map, along with directions to each location.<br><br>SCP-9002-1 is a barbershop located in ████ █████ Street, that doesn't exist on the actual map. 20 minutes after entering SCP-9002's building people will start experiencing an illness called "The Haze". The symptoms last around 15 minutes and include severe vomiting and blurred vision. The illness can be cured by stepping outside SCP-9002's building for 10 minutes or taking Antiemetics pills (A pillbox was found beside SCP-9001).<br><br><h5>SCP-9002-3 is an apartment located at the end of ██th Street, that doesn't exit on the actual map. Inside it there are 3 paintings:</h5> One with a human face crying multiple tears; one with what seems to be blood pouring from it; and one depicting what appears to be an old man sleeping beside human body parts hanging from meat hooks (See Description). At night if someone enters inside this apartment they will start to experience extreme paranoia . If this happens then they must take another pillbox (this time containing Amnesiacs) found inside SCP 9009 -1 before getting out of there or else they won't wake up again until someone enters inside their room. People stuck in here don't have any memories about [REDACTED]. If you want more information about it please read attached document #GPT 9009 -1-.5 .<br><br><br><h5>SCP – 9009 - 1 is a 4 meters tall and 2 meters wide closet located in front of Scp - 9003 , which contains different objects related to GPT 9007 . It also contains 8 pills boxes:</h5> 4 blue ones containing antiemetics , 3 green ones containing amnesiacs , 1 red one containing both antiemetics and amnesiacs , 1 yellow one containg sleeping pills and an orange one without content.<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9002 was found in a house located at ████ █████ Street , inside a closet without any door. The only way to enter it is by climbing and jumping through the window.<br><br>SCP-9002 was discovered after reports of several people going crazy started to appear around the city (see Document #GPT 9009 -1-.2 for details). The police arrested those people and took them to Site-██, but they woke up with no memory about what happened before that moment so they were released. This situation wasn't solved until Agent ██████ entered inside SCP 9009 - 1, where he found SCP-9002 . After this incident all affected persons regained their memories about what happened before [REDACTED] and also about the whole world witnessed there (See Document #GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 - .3 ).<br><br><h5>Addendum 9002.1: Interview with Agent ██████:</h5><br><br><h5>+ Open interview 9002-1 - Hide interview 9002-1 Interviewer:</h5> Dr. ████.<br><br><h5>Interviewee: Agent D███████. <Begin Log> Dr. ████ :</h5> Good Morning Agent D███████ .<br><br><h5>Agent D███████ : Good morning Sir, how are you? Dr . ████ : Im fine , but i want to ask you a question about the incident happened in GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 . In there you found SCP-9002 and retrieved it, then whats its connection with this whole enigma? Why did those people lose their memories and got crazy? And also what is GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 ? Is that related to SCP-9007 ? Agent D██████F:</h5> I dont know sir, but i will try to answer your questions the best that i can . The first thing we found was SCP-9002 inside a closet without any door inside the building where we arrested those individuals (see Document #GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 - .4 ). We took them to Site – 79 , where they woke up without memory about everything except for their name and hometowns (See Document #GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 – − 3 ). After some days passed they started going crazy again and began acting weird around other people (See Document #GPT ͞ʘ f 0900 − 4 ) so we decided take them back here to interrogate them and find out why they lost their memories or what kind of illness affected them, but when one of our agents entered inside that apartment he found SCP–9002 , after which all affected persons regained memories from GTPT ͞҉ᇴϻµ☄Ⓗⓐⓟ☾Ɲⁿ¡ⁿ ⁱ§🌐💯😊👍🏻‼️👌🏼✌🏽♔️◕‿◕✖️¶❄❃☃⛈☪❅ ♨♠♥♦♣♦♣♥▪▫¯\_Ω_↑↗↖▪↔┳┬╭╮╰╯─┤ÜáÀåĂȂȁșȇƠǅǲȗṊṋḾḷḸŀեᶎร๏๎๑۩۝۽פＭＳｚｚＵゥヤ火㍉㌧侑槫嬡忙槫<br><br><h5>Addendum9002.2:</h5> Document #GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1 - .4<br><br><h5>+ Open document # GPT ͞ʘ 9009 - 1- .4 Hide document # GPT ͞ʘ 9009 -1- .4 Transcript of Interview with Agent ██████: Dr. ████ : Ok so, i saw the report about you arresting those individuals on ████ Street and also about the incident happened on Site-██, could you tell me how did that happened? Agent D██████F :</h5> Yes sir, it was a normal day when one of our agents came to us saying that he found a man eating out of trash cans , so we decided take him to the hospital but before we could do anything else he started running in different directions (See Video Log). After he broke free from his handcuffs and escaped from us by jumping through the window i decided go inside SCP-9002's closet with another agent (Agent S█████) because we had suspicions about it.
