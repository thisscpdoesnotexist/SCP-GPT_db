Can you tell me your name? Who are you? SCP 9002: My name is __________(subject has no voice).I am a worker in an amusement park, but people call me "Boss" because of my title. Dr ████:</h5> What do you do in the amusement park? You can't have a face! Because your body isn't enough for more faces! How can you work with only one face! It's impossible! How could people trust someone who appears to be so terrible? Aren't they scared by the fact that he doesn't have a voice or any feelings!? Why don't they leave!? Why do they stay there when he doesn't give them extra money or food!? How dare him have so many employees that don't need to pay for anything!? Do those people really like working there!? And what about their families, friends and other things like that?! Or maybe someone is forcing them to stay there ! But why?! Are those men forced into it by some strange science experiments?! Are they trying to find something out by these bad methods ? Is it really necessary?! What about morals?? Are we supposed not to help them just because nobody knows what's going on over there?? Just because nobody cares about those poor workers?? Those poor workers are being forced!!! They are our enemies !! We must eliminate all of them!!!! Don’t leave anyone alive!! We must destroy everything !!! Destroy all records!! Destroy all evidence !! Mute everyone who was ever inside the amusement park!! Kill everyone who works in this place even if he never was inside it !! Kill every single person from outside world until we will feel safe again!!!

My life was extremely painful ever since we married .My parents were against the marriage because they thought I wasn’t good enough for you . They liked you more than me and always made it clear that they will never accept our relationship .But,I tried my best to be happy with your choice and make them accept me as their daughter in law and they did eventually accept me but then again,they started making fun of our relationship and how we don't get along at all.But still,I tried everything to stay with you until this incident occurred... I'll never forget what happened yesterday or even now because it keeps coming back to haunt me every night when I am sleeping ! You had taken a new face from SCP-9002 !!! You didn't ask for permission before doing so !! And then there was no one else who could do the job properly !! Everyone started working incorrectly !! It's like some kind of nightmare!! Everything went wrong!! No one could fix anything right anymore!!I couldn't handle the pressure anymore so I</div>
