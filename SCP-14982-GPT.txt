When consuming sound waves produced by these devices, <i>SCP-14982</i> gains the ability to produce a vocalization which causes all humans within earshot to perceive it as being highly attractive; however this effect does not apply if the listener already has a significant other or spouse. This effect wears off after approximately 10 minutes of exposure to <i>SCP-14982</i>'s voice; however it can be renewed if another sound wave producer is used within earshot of the listener during this time period.<br><br><i>SCP-14982</i> was discovered in ████████ Park on 2017/06/02 after reports from civilians about an <i>"attractive woman singing"</i>. Upon investigation by Foundation agents embedded in local law enforcement agencies, several witnesses were found with symptoms consistent with infatuation with an individual they could not identify (see Addendum 14981a). Agents were able to track down and apprehend <i>SCP-14982</i> using standard procedures for capturing Class F Anomalies without incident . The identity and whereabouts of all affected civilians are currently unknown . All civilian witnesses have been administered Class A amnestics , and false memories implanted into their minds using standard amnestic techniques .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14982.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████, a civilian who was affected by <i>SCP-14982</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Hello, Mr.███████. I'm going to ask you a few questions about the incident at the park earlier this week. Can you tell me what happened? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Well…I was just walking through the park when I saw this really cute girl singing on stage…and then she came up to me and started talking to me and we went out for dinner afterwards! Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>That's very interesting; can you tell me what she looked like? <br><br><b>███████: </b>She had long black hair, brown eyes, and a mole under her left eye…oh wait that's not right…Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Excuse me? What do you mean <i>"that's not right"</i>? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Oh uh sorry it must have been someone else that I went out with! [laughs] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It is unknown whether or not <i>SCP-14982</i> is still in possession of its anomalous properties; however if it is they are likely contained within its body at all times .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14982.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 14982-A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14982</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-14982</i> is placed in a sound proofed room and exposed to a radio transmitter playing the song <i>"Gee"</i> by Girls' Generation.<br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected, <i>SCP-14982</i> consumed the sound waves produced by the radio transmitter, gaining its anomalous properties. Upon completion of consuming all sound waves produced by the transmitter, it proceeded to vocalize for approximately 10 minutes; however no anomalous effects were observed in any of the D-class personnel within earshot . It was then explained that this was because they already had significant others or spouses, and that its voice did not affect them due to this fact. As expected, when another D-class personnel who did not have a significant other or spouse was brought into earshot of <i>SCP-14982</i>'s voice during this time period , they reported feeling an attraction towards it which increased over time. This effect wore off after approximately 10 minutes as predicted .<br><br>Experiment 14982-B:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Two male D class personnel (D1 and D3) with no significant others or spouses; one female D class personnel (D4) with a husband but no children; one female child (C1). All subjects are equipped with heart rate monitors and have their vital signs monitored via ECG while being exposed to <i>SCP-14982</i>'s voice during Experiment 1482 - A .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as Experiment 1482 - A , except C1 is present as well for comparison purposes . Both male subjects report experiencing feelings of infatuation towards an unknown individual upon exposure to SCP - 14 98 2 ' s v o i c e ; however these feelings do not increase over time . The same effect occurs in C 1 , although her feelings are much stronger than those felt by either male subject due to her age group being more susceptible than adults . Female subject reports feeling similar effects as males do upon exposure to an unknown individual ; however she has difficulty identifying what gender said individual is due to her lack of understanding regarding human anatomy at such a young age. Results found here match those found in Experiment 1482 - A: both male subjects report experiencing infatuation towards an unknown individual after being exposed for 10 minutes without any further increase over time ; whereas C 1 continues reporting strong infatuation towards said individual even after test has ended , although she still cannot identify what gender said individual is due to her lack of understanding regarding human anatomy at such a young age. Female subject reports feeling similar effects as males do upon exposure without any further increase over time ; however she has difficulty identifying what gender said individuals are due to her lack of understanding regarding human anatomy at such a young age.

Subject shows signs consistent with severe depression following experiment's conclusion despite showing no initial symptoms prior experiment's start up..
