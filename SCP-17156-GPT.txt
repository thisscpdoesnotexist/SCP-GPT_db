<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17156 is  a Guerilla with every military tactics and Every evil plan he has</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17156<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17156</i> is an entity of unknown origin, appearing as a humanoid male in his late twenties. <i>SCP-17156</i> is capable of using advanced military tactics and strategies to achieve its goals. Its primary goal appears to be the destruction of all life on Earth, though it has not yet taken any action towards this end.<br><br><i>SCP-17156</i> possesses several unique abilities which are used to further its goals. These include:<br><br>• The ability to manipulate time, allowing it to rapidly deploy large numbers of troops or equipment from any location at will. <br>• The ability to create and control powerful artificial intelligence programs, which can be used for reconnaissance and combat purposes. <br>• The ability to control the minds of individuals within a certain range, allowing it to influence their decisions or actions without their knowledge or consent. <br>• The ability to teleport itself and others over long distances with little effort or energy expenditure. <br>• A form of precognition that allows <i>SCP-17156</i> an insight into future events related directly or indirectly with its own plans and objectives. <br><br> Additionally, <i>SCP-17156</i> has displayed a high level of resistance against most forms of conventional weaponry; bullets fired at it have been observed passing through without causing injury while explosives have had no effect whatsoever on its body structure when detonated nearby (though they do cause minor damage). It also seems immune against most forms of mental manipulation attempts by other entities such as Class B amnestics or memetic agents; however more extreme measures such as those employed by MTF Omega-7 (<i>"Pandora's Box"</i>) may still prove effective in containing the entity if necessary .<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17156</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. All personnel assigned to <i>SCP-17156</i> are to be trained in the use of advanced military tactics and strategies, as well as basic countermeasures against its abilities. Any attempts by <i>SCP-17156</i> to escape or otherwise breach containment are to be met with lethal force if necessary.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential damage caused by <i>SCP-17156</i>'s activities, all personnel assigned must remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or unusual behavior immediately. Additionally, MTF Omega-7 (<i>"Pandora's Box"</i>) is on standby at all times should more extreme measures need to be taken in the event of a containment breach.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17156.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-17156</i> was observed engaging in a skirmish with an unidentified entity. The engagement resulted in the death of several Foundation personnel and the destruction of multiple pieces of equipment. MTF Omega-7 (<i>"Pandora's Box"</i>) was dispatched to contain the situation; however, <i>SCP-17156</i> managed to escape before they could arrive on site.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 17156.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17156</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17156</i> was interviewed by Dr.████ in order to gain more insight into its motives and plans.
