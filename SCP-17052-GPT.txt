The locker must be guarded by two (2) personnel at all times, and access to the locker must be restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher.<br><br>When <i>SCP-17052</i> is removed from its containment locker for testing purposes, it must be handled with extreme caution by no more than two (2) personnel wearing full body armor and helmets. All tests involving <i>SCP-17052</i> must take place within a reinforced observation chamber, and all personnel present during the test are required to remain at least 15 meters away from <i>SCP-17052</i> at all times.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17052</i> is a standard wooden baseball bat, measuring approximately two feet in length. The wood used to construct the bat appears to be of an unknown origin, and is both incredibly durable and lightweight.<br><br>When <i>SCP-17052</i> makes contact with any living creature, it instantly kills them regardless of their size or strength. This effect extends to nonliving objects as well; if <i>SCP-17052</i> strikes a solid object such as a wall or tree, it will cause the object to immediately disintegrate into dust.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-17052</i> are not limited by distance; even the slightest bonk from its handle can cause instant death up to 10 meters away from its point of contact. Furthermore, no matter how hard or soft the strike may be, it will always result in death. It also appears that this effect cannot be reversed once activated; attempts at reviving victims have been unsuccessful so far.<br><br>Due to its dangerous nature, containment procedures for <i>SCP-17052</i> are strictly enforced by personnel assigned to guard it at all times while wearing protective gear such as helmets and bulletproof vests. In addition, all personnel must remain at least 15 meters away from <i>SCP-17052</i> during testing and experimentation sessions unless otherwise instructed by onsite supervisors.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17052.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ when an unknown individual managed to break into the locker containing <i>SCP-17052</i> and stole it. The intruder was later apprehended by security personnel and the bat was recovered without incident. Following this incident, additional security measures have been put in place to prevent a similar occurrence from happening again.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17052.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17052</i> was used in an experiment to determine its effects on nonliving objects. The following is a transcript of the interview with the researcher who conducted the test:<br><br><h3>Addendum 17052.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 17052-A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-Class personnel (D-4567)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The subject was instructed to approach <i>SCP-17052</i> and make contact with it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon making contact, the subject immediately died. Autopsy results revealed that all of the organs in his body had been liquefied.</div>
