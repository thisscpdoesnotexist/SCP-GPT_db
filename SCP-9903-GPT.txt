Testing with <i>SCP-9903</i> is currently suspended.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9903</i> is a discarded candy cigarette box branded <i>"Victory"</i>. The label on the front of <i>SCP-9903</i> reads <i>"VICTORY"</i> in large red letters with a smaller black banner underneath reading <i>"CIGARETTES FOR THE BOYS WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US"</i>. <i>SCP-9903</i> is covered in dust and has signs of wear.<br><br><i>SCP-9903</i> was recovered from ███████, France after reports of several children becoming increasingly violent and aggressive. It was discovered that these children were under the influence of <i>SCP-9903</i>. After confiscation, all affected children showed no signs of aggression or violence towards others. All affected individuals were administered Class C amnestics and released back into their homes.<br><br>When a human subject smokes an entire cigarette from <i>SCP-9903</i> they will begin to feel increasingly violent and aggressive towards other humans for approximately 1 hour before calming down again. Subjects who have smoked cigarettes from <i>SCP-9903</i> are not affected by it again until 24 hours have passed since their last use . This effect does not appear to be addictive or harmful to subjects who smoke cigarettes from <i>SCP-9903</i> but may cause harm if used excessively .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9903.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br>The following interview was conducted with a former user of <i>SCP-9903</i>, ██████ ██████, who had smoked from <i>SCP-9903</i> for several months. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello Mr. ██████, I would like to ask you some questions about your experiences with <i>SCP-9903</i>. Is that alright? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Yeah sure doc, go ahead and ask away <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Alright then… how did you first come into contact with <i>SCP-9903</i>? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Well it was back in '44 when I was just a kid growing up in France during the war… my parents were killed by those damn Nazis and I had nowhere else to go so me and my brother started living on the streets… we were starving most of the time but we managed to find an old cigarette box lying around one day and decided to smoke them just for fun… <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>How long did it take before you noticed any effects? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>It didn't really take long at all really, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after smoking one of those cigarettes from that box we started feeling real angry at everything… like there wasn't anything in this world that wasn't pissing us off anymore (laughs) <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So what happened after that? <br><br><b>Subject: </b>We went on a bit of a rampage actually (laughs). We broke into this rich guy's house and stole everything he owned! It felt great too! We felt strong enough to take down an entire army! After that we got caught by some police officers but they didn't try anything funny against us because they knew something was different about us somehow (laughs). The next thing I know is getting shipped off here to Site-[REDACTED] where everyone told me they found me wandering around town covered in blood trying to kill anyone who got close enough (laughs). That was probably my favorite part though because it made me feel like nothing could stop me now! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 9903.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log <i>SCP-9903</i> - Close Experiment 9903.1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-3723, a 24 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-3723 is given one cigarette from <i>SCP-9903</i> and instructed to smoke it. D-3723 complies with the instructions and smokes the cigarette. After smoking the cigarette, D-3723 is instructed to attack Agent ██████ who is present in the testing chamber for this experiment . Agent ██████ draws his firearm and shoots at D-3723 who proceeds to attack him with a knife he had concealed on his person . After being shot twice by Agent ██████, D-3723 collapses and dies of blood loss from his wounds . <br><br><b>Results: </b>The cigarettes produced by <i>SCP-9903</i> are not harmful when smoked but appear to have an effect that compels users to become aggressive towards others after smoking them. This effect lasts approximately 1 hour before it wears off again . Experiment 9903.2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A single cigarette produced by <i>SCP-9903</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The single cigarette produced by <i>SCP-9903</i> was smoked in a standard testing chamber without any human subjects present for this experiment . <br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject did not exhibit any unusual behavior or aggression during or after smoking the cigarette but did note that they felt slightly more energetic than usual afterwards despite having just smoked a full pack of cigarettes within 30 minutes of each other without feeling tired at all beforehand . <h3>Addendum 9903.4 : </h3>On 06/02/20██, Drs. ████ and █████████ were found dead in their office at Site 17 with their wrists slit open using a pen knife belonging to Drs. ████'s desk drawer which was found nearby on the floor next to their bodies along with several empty packs of cigarettes from SCP Foundation facilities across Europe including Site 19 as well as some empty packs branded <i>"Victory"</i>. It appears that both Drs.' deaths were due to suicide although no notes left behind indicate why they decided do so together or what drove them both over the edge like this since neither of them showed signs of depression or mental illness prior to their deaths according as noted in their personnel files which are available for review upon request if you're cleared for access level 3/9904 clearance level 4 (see addendum 2). Further investigation into these events has been suspended pending further developments until further notice per O5 order #7644519</div>
