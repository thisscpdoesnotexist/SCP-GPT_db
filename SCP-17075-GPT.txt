The cell must be equipped with several objects of interest for <i>SCP-17075</i>, such as brightly colored toys and other interactive items. At least one staff member should remain within the containment area at all times to monitor <i>SCP-17075</i>'s behavior and ensure its safety.<br><br>Any personnel entering the containment area must wear protective goggles or face masks to prevent eye contact with <i>SCP-17075</i>; failure to do so may result in prolonged fixation on the entity.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17075</i> is a humanoid entity approximately 1.5 meters tall, resembling a centaur composed of various materials including wood, metal, and glass. <i>SCP-17075</i> appears to be sentient, possessing the ability to move freely and communicate via basic sign language.<br><br><i>SCP-17075</i>'s primary anomalous property is its ability to draw attention from any living creature within a 10 meter radius of itself. This effect causes creatures within this range to become fixated on <i>SCP-17075</i> for extended periods of time; however, no physical or psychological harm has been observed as a result of this fixation.<br><br>When not under observation by personnel or other creatures, <i>SCP-17075</i> will often wander around its containment area in search of objects or people it can interact with; it has displayed an affinity for bright colors and shiny objects in particular. It also appears to have some form of telepathic bond with certain staff members assigned to its containment unit; these individuals report feeling an inexplicable connection with the entity when they are near it.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17075.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17075</i> was observed to be in a state of distress and agitation. After several hours of observation, it was determined that the entity had become fixated on an individual who had entered its containment area without proper protection. The individual in question was administered Class-A amnestics and removed from the premises; <i>SCP-17075</i> returned to its normal behavior shortly thereafter.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17075.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17075</i> was interviewed by Dr. ██████ in an effort to better understand its behavior and motivations. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-17075</i>. Can you tell me your name?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17075</i>: </b>[Signs] My name is Attention.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17075.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/<br><br><b>20██: </b><i>SCP-17075</i> was exposed to a variety of objects and individuals, including several staff members. Results showed that the entity was able to draw attention from all subjects within its range; however, it seemed more drawn towards certain individuals than others. Further experimentation is pending.</div>
