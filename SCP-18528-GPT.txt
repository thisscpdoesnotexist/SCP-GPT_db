However, when it comes into contact with organic material (such as living tissue), it will immediately begin to absorb the material at an alarming rate. This process causes extreme pain to the victim and can quickly lead to death if left unchecked.<br><br><i>SCP-18528</i> has displayed limited sentience on several occasions but does not appear to respond to verbal commands or attempts at communication from personnel. It is unknown what motivates <i>SCP-18528</i>’s behavior or why it seeks out organic matter for sustenance; however, containment procedures are currently being developed in order to keep personnel safe from its effects while further research is conducted.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18528</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with an air filtration system capable of removing the noxious fumes emitted by <i>SCP-18528</i>.<br><br>Personnel entering <i>SCP-18528</i>’s containment chamber must wear full protective gear, including a gas mask and hazmat suit, to prevent contact with the entity’s smog form. All personnel are also required to undergo decontamination procedures upon exiting the chamber.<br><br>In order to minimize risk of exposure, all organic material (including food and water) must be provided through robotic delivery systems or other non-organic means. Any attempts at communication with <i>SCP-18528</i> should only be made under<br><br><h3> Addendum 18528.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18528</i> was observed to be in contact with a human female for an extended period of time. During this event, the entity appeared to take on a more humanoid form and displayed basic communication skills. However, after approximately 30 minutes the entity reverted back to its smog form and began emitting noxious fumes again. Further research is required to determine if this behavior can be replicated or controlled in any way.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18528.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18528</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-18528</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> On ██/██/20██, Dr. ████████ attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-18528</i> in an effort to gain insight into its behavior and motivations.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello there, <i>SCP-18528</i>.
