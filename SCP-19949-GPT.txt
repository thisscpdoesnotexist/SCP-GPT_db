<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19949 is  I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole. Diggy diggy hole. Diggy diggy hole.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19949<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19949</i> is an animate humanoid entity, approximately 0.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 15 kg. It appears to be a dwarf, with a large beard and wearing traditional dwarven clothing.<br><br><i>SCP-19949</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it begins to dig a hole in the ground, regardless of the material it is attempting to dig through. When this occurs, <i>SCP-19949</i> will begin chanting <i>"Diggy Diggy Hole"</i> in an unknown language while digging. As it digs deeper into the ground, its speed increases exponentially until eventually reaching speeds that exceed human capabilities by several orders of magnitude.<br><br>Upon completion of its excavation efforts, <i>SCP-19949</i> will emerge from the newly created hole carrying various items such as coins or jewelry which have been buried beneath the surface for centuries or even millennia. The exact origin and purpose of these items are currently unknown but they appear to be valuable artifacts from ancient civilizations around the world.<br><br>In addition to its excavation abilities, <i>SCP-19949</i> also possesses limited telepathic communication capabilities; however these are only capable of transmitting simple concepts such as hunger or thirst as well as basic commands such as <i>"Stop"</i>. Despite this ability, attempts at further communication have proven unsuccessful due to either a lack of understanding on both sides or simply because <i>SCP-19949</i> has no interest in engaging in conversation with humans beyond what is necessary for its own survival needs (i.e food).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-19949</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with an automated digging device capable of excavating the ground beneath the chamber, as well as a supply of food and water for <i>SCP-19949</i>'s sustenance. All personnel entering or leaving the containment area must wear protective gear due to <i>SCP-19949</i>'s excavation capabilities.<br><br>In order to prevent any potential damage caused by its anomalous properties, all excavation efforts performed by <i>SCP-19949</i> must be monitored and supervised by Foundation personnel at all times. Any artifacts unearthed during these activities are to be collected and stored in a secure storage locker within Site-██ for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19949.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-19949</i> was observed to have unearthed a large stone tablet inscribed with an unknown language. Upon further analysis, it was determined that the tablet contained instructions on how to construct a powerful artifact capable of granting its wielder immense power and control over all living things. As such, the Foundation has taken steps to ensure that this knowledge remains secure and out of the wrong hands.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19949.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19949</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation researcher attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-19949</i> in order to gain further information about its capabilities and origin. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-19949</i>. Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19949</i>:</b> Yes. I understand you. Diggy diggy hole. Diggy diggy hole. <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> What is your purpose? Why do you dig these holes? <br><b><br><i>SCP-19949</i>:</b> To find the treasures hidden beneath the ground. They are mine to keep and share with others who need them most. <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> Where do you come from? Who are you? <br><b><br><i>SCP-19949</i>:</b> I am a dwarf. I have been digging for many years, searching for the treasures of the earth.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19949.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 19949.3-A:</b> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-19949</i> was instructed to dig a hole in the center of Site-██'s containment chamber. After approximately two hours of digging, <i>SCP-19949</i> emerged from the newly created hole carrying an ornate golden crown which appeared to be of ancient Egyptian origin. The crown was taken into Foundation custody and is currently being studied by researchers at Site-██.</div>
