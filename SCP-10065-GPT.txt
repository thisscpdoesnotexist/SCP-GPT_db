I'm Dr. ███ from the SCP Foundation, and I'd like to ask you a few questions about your work <i>"<i>SCP-10065</i>"</i>. Is that alright?<br><br><b>████████████: </b>Yeah, sure thing doc! What do you need to know?<br><br>Dr. ███: Well first off all, could you tell me where the idea for <i>"<i>SCP-10065</i>"</i> came from? It seems rather… unique in its creation process compared to other works we've seen before now… did anything unusual happen while writing it? Any dreams or hallucinations perhaps? We're just trying to get a better understanding of how this anomaly came into being… but if it's too personal that's fine too! We can talk about something else instead if you'd prefer!<br><br><b>████████████: </b>Oh no no no it's fine doc! No worries at all there; I've been expecting this question for awhile now actually haha! So yeah as far as where the idea came from goes… well when I was younger my parents got divorced and my mom remarried pretty quickly afterwards so I ended up with two dads instead of one haha! It wasn't really a big deal though since both were pretty cool guys and they got along great so everything worked out in the end anyways haha!! But yeah after that whole ordeal happened is when I started thinking about what would happen if someone had more than one dad and then like two years later or something is when I started writing <i>"<i>SCP-10065</i>"</i> heheh!! And uh yeah nothing really happened while writing it other than some nightmares here and there but nothing crazy or anything hahaha!! And then uh well once it was done doing whatever it does whenever someone reads/watches/plays it is when things got weird around here hahahaha!! But don't worry doc nothin' bad happened; just a lot of people died hahahaha!!! Hahahahahahahahhaa!!! Haaaaaahhhahahhaaaaahhhhaaaa!!! [At this point Mr. ████████ began laughing hysterically for approximately ten minutes before calming down.] Oh sorry sorry sorry haha!! Just had a sudden flashback to those old days back in high school heheheheheheeheeheeheeheeee!!!!! Haaaaaaaahhhhahahaaaaaaaaa!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!! [Mr. ████████ continued laughing hysterically until termination.] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 10065.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-83726<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to read a document containing <i>SCP-10065</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-10065</i> manifested as a humanoid entity wearing clothing similar to that worn by the character in question.
