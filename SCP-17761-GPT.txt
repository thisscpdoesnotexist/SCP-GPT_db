We gave it LSD and that had an adverse effect on the entire universe.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17761<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17761</i> is an entity of unknown origin and form, believed to be a Boltzmann brain. It has the ability to manipulate reality in order to simulate our own universe, as well as other alternate universes.<br><br>Its primary purpose appears to be the preservation of its own existence by creating an environment which it can survive in indefinitely. This environment is believed to be a virtual reality simulation which <i>SCP-17761</i> can control at will.<br><br>While <i>SCP-17761</i> has been observed manipulating its simulated environment, it does not appear capable of directly interacting with objects or entities within this world. Instead, it relies on various anomalous phenomena such as telepathy and psychokinesis in order to influence events within its simulated universe.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-17761</i>, it is impossible to contain or control its activities. As such, all attempts at containment have been suspended indefinitely.<br><br>In order to prevent any further damage caused by <i>SCP-17761</i>'s manipulation of reality, Foundation personnel are instructed to monitor its activity and intervene if necessary. Any anomalous phenomena observed within its simulated universe should be reported immediately for further investigation.<br><br>Furthermore, under no circumstances should any form of psychotropic drugs or substances be administered to <i>SCP-17761</i> as this could potentially cause catastrophic consequences on a universal scale.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17761.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation research team attempted to administer LSD to <i>SCP-17761</i> in order to observe the effects of psychotropic drugs on its simulated universe. This resulted in a catastrophic chain reaction which caused the destruction of all matter within its simulated universe and caused severe damage to our own reality.<br><br>As such, all attempts at administering any form of psychotropic drugs or substances have been strictly forbidden by O5 Command.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17761.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17761</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation researcher attempted to interview <i>SCP-17761</i> in order to gain further insight into its nature and purpose. The following is an excerpt from the conversation:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> <i>"What are you?"</i><br><b><br><i>SCP-17761</i>:</b> <i>"I am a Boltzmann brain, created by forces beyond your comprehension."</i> <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> <i>"What is your purpose?"</i> <br> 			       	  	      	      <i>SCP-17761</i>: <i>"To survive. To exist as long as possible in this simulated universe I have created."</i> <br><b><br>Researcher:</b> <i>"Do you have any plans for the future?"</i> <br>			       	  	      	      <i>SCP-17761</i>: <i>"Yes. I plan to continue manipulating reality in order to ensure my own survival."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 17761.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation research team administered 25mg of LSD to <i>SCP-17761</i> in order to observe its reaction.<br><br><b>The results were catastrophic:</b> the simulated universe began to rapidly deteriorate and collapse, resulting in an unprecedented level of destruction across multiple dimensions. Fortunately, the effects were contained before any permanent damage could be done. However, it is believed that this event may have caused irreparable harm on a universal scale.</div>
