It appears to be in good health and has no visible means of propulsion or support. <i>SCP-17743</i> is capable of vocalizing meows, purrs, and other typical feline vocalizations.<br><br>When spoken to directly, <i>SCP-17743</i> will respond with varying levels of intelligence and understanding depending on the subject's level of knowledge about cats. When asked questions related to cats, <i>SCP-17743</i> will typically provide accurate information regarding their behavior and habits.<br><br><i>SCP-17743</i> does not appear to require sustenance or rest, though it has occasionally been observed sleeping while still airborne. The object's movements are erratic but generally consistent with those made by a normal cat; it often stops suddenly as if startled by something unseen before continuing its flight path.<br><br>When threatened or attacked (either physically or verbally) <i>SCP-17743</i> will react defensively by hissing loudly and attempting to flee from the source of danger at high speed until it reaches a safe distance away from the threat. If pursued further, <i>SCP-17743</i> may become aggressive and attempt to bite the pursuer with its sharp teeth before fleeing again at high speed once more until it feels secure enough that the threat is gone for good.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-17743</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber with a minimum of two (2) security personnel present at all times. The chamber should be equipped with padded walls and ceiling to minimize potential injury from <i>SCP-17743</i>'s erratic movements.<br><br>Personnel are not allowed to interact directly with <i>SCP-17743</i> unless approved by the Site Director or their designee. If interaction is necessary, personnel must wear protective gear and remain at least 2 meters away from the object at all times. Personnel should also avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that may startle <i>SCP-17743</i> as this could lead to an aggressive response from the object.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17743.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17743</i> was observed to be in the presence of an unknown entity. The entity appeared to be a humanoid figure wearing a hooded robe and had its back turned towards <i>SCP-17743</i> at all times. The two entities conversed for approximately five minutes before <i>SCP-17743</i> flew away from the area at high speed. No further sightings of this individual have been reported since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17743.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17743</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17743</i><br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17743</i>.
