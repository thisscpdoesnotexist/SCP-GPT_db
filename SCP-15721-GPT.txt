Any personnel who have expressed strong opinions on the subject matter mentioned in <i>SCP-15721</i> are not allowed to read it.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15721</i> is a scroll containing a list of names, organized into columns. The names are those of individuals who have been involved in the production or dissemination of information that is considered to be controversial by the Foundation.<br><br><i>SCP-15721</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is read aloud by an individual who has previously expressed strong opinions on the subject matter mentioned in <i>SCP-15721</i>. Upon completion of reading <i>SCP-15721</i>, all individuals present will have their minds altered to conform with those expressed by the reader. This process can take anywhere from five minutes to two hours depending on how many individuals are present and how strongly they hold their original beliefs. Individuals under this effect will not remember being exposed to <i>SCP-15721</i>'s effects and will instead believe that they independently arrived at these conclusions through independent research and/or personal experience .<br><br>After exposure, affected subjects will become extremely hostile towards any person or group which holds opposing views on the subject matter mentioned in <i>SCP-1571</i>; this includes both organizations and specific persons (for <br><br><b>example: </b>if an individual expresses support for a political party which opposes gun control legislation , they may become hostile towards other parties which support gun control legislation). Affected subjects may also attempt to spread information supporting their position using any means available (including legal methods such as protesting or petitioning; illegal methods such as vandalism or assault; or violent means including murder). In addition, affected subjects often attempt to recruit new members for groups supporting their position (see Addendum 15721a). If no groups exist which support these positions, affected subjects may create them .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15721.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████, author of <i>SCP-15721</i><br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ on █/██/2018. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, Mr. ██████. I'm going to be conducting an interview with you today about your creation of <i>SCP-15721</i> and its effects on the Foundation's activities in the past year and a half since it came into our possession . <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Uh… sure thing, doc . I don't know what you want me to say though; I just wrote that thing because people needed to see the truth . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>That may be so, but we need to understand how exactly this came about before we can move forward with our current containment procedures . <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Oh yeah… well, it all started when my friend got killed by some crazy fuck who had a gun… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please focus on events leading up to your writing of <i>SCP-15721</i> for now; we'll get back to that later in this interview if necessary . Mr.: Oh yeah… sorry about that doc . Anyway , after my friend died from getting shot , I took it upon myself to do something about it; so I started writing letters and sending emails out telling everyone how guns are dangerous and they need more regulation or whatever … nothing happened though because no one wanted anything done … they just said <i>"guns don't kill people"</i> or whatever bullshit excuse they had for not doing anything … then Trump won the election which made me even more mad than before because he's totally against gun control legislation … then one day while browsing through Facebook someone posted a meme saying <i>"gun control laws only affect law abiding citizens"</i> which is total bullshit because criminals don't follow laws anyway so why would they give a shit ? So after reading that meme I thought <i>"this is fucking stupid"</i> so I decided write something better than that meme ; something real and true ; something people would actually listen too … then later at work while trying come up with ideas for what should go into this new thing , someone brought up an article talking about how there was recently a mass shooting at some school in Florida where 17 kids were killed by some crazy kid who used an assault rifle (which is basically like a machine gun) … then later when thinking of names for these lists , another coworker mentioned [REDACTED] which was also recently involved in another mass shooting where [REDACTED] were killed using assault rifles (also basically like machine guns) ...then everything just clicked <br><br><b>together: </b>if assault rifles are used during these shootings , maybe banning them will stop them ! And if banning them doesn't work maybe making them harder for civilians to buy will work ! So after thinking all this stuff over ,I decided write down all these ideas onto paper along with other things like facts supporting my opinions such as facts from articles / studies / etc .. Then once everything was written down properly onto paper (which took awhile since there were lots of lists),I typed out everything onto word document and added pictures / memes / gifs / etc .. Then finally once all finished typing everything up properly onto computer file (which also took awhile since there were lots of lists),I printed out copies using printer at work along with printing extra copies using printer at home along with printing extra copies using personal printer plus making digital versions available online via website plus making digital versions available online via website plus making digital versions available online via website plus making digital versions available online via website plus making digital versions available online via website plus sending email attachments containing pdf files containing pdf files containing pdf files containing pdf files containing pdf files containing pdf files containing pdf file scontainingpdffilescontainingpdffilescontainingpdffilescontainingpdffile scontainingpdffilescontai ningpdffil escon tainingp dfis con tainingp dfis con tainingp dfis con tainingp dfis con tainingp dfi sconta i ningpd fisc ontai ningpd fisc ontai ningpd fisc ontai ningpd fisc ontain ing pd fi sconta i ng pd fi sconta i ng pd fi sconta i ng pd fi sconta i ng pd fi sco na ingpd fic o na ingpd fic o na ingpd fic o na ingpa dfi c onai g<br><br><h3>Addendum 15721.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15721-1: </b>D-95782 was exposed to <i>SCP-15721</i> under the guise of an experiment to test its effects on memory. As expected, D-95782's memories were altered and he was led to believe that he had independently arrived at his beliefs through personal experience. He was then instructed to read <i>SCP-15721</i> aloud in order to confirm its effects. After exposure, D-95782 became hostile towards anyone who held opposing views on the subject matter mentioned in <i>SCP-15721</i> and attempted to recruit other Foundation personnel. When approached by researchers for further testing, D-95782 refused and stated that <i>"he knew what they were up to"</i>.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15721-2: </b>Three Foundation researchers (Drs. ████, ██████, and █████) were exposed simultaneously . The results of this experiment are as <br><br><b>follows: </b>Drs. ████ and █████ both expressed strong support for a political party which opposed gun control legislation; Drs. ████ and █████ both expressed strong support for a political party which supported gun control legislation; Drs. ████ and █████ both expressed strong support for a political party which supported gun control legislation; Drs. ████ ,████████ ,and████████ all expressed strong support for a political party which opposed gun control legislation; no parties existed with opposing views on this subject matter . All three doctors now believe that they independently arrived at these conclusions through independent research .<br><br>Experiment 15721 -3: A group of twenty individuals (ten Foundation personnel from various departments including Security, Research & Development, Medical Services ,and Site Maintenance ; ten non -Foundation civilians) were exposed simultaneously . The results of this experiment are as <br><br><b>follows: </b>Security staff became hostile towards non -Foundation civilians who held opposing views on the subject matter mentioned in SCP -157 21 ; Research & Development staff became hostile towards non -Foundation civilians who held opposing views on the subject matter mentioned in SCP -15 7 21 ; Medical Services staff became hostile towards non -Foundation civilians who held opposing views on the subject matter mentioned in SC P – 15 71 ; Site Maintenance staff became hostile towards non – Foundation civilians who held opposing views o nthesubjectmattermentionedinSCP–1571; all groups believed t hat they had come t o these conclusions independently after conducting extensive research into their respective fields . Non – Foundation civilian subjects did not develop any hostility or attempt recruitment or organization efforts after reading SCP – 15 71 but did express an interest in learning more about it once their memories returned several hours later (see Addendum 1 57 2 1a).</div>
