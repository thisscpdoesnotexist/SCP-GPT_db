Dr. ████:: Well for starters I'd like to know more about her personality before the incident happened… so how would you describe her as a person? ████████:: She was always really shy around people she didn't know but once she got comfortable around someone she could be really nice and funny sometimes too! …*sigh*….she was always so nice to everyone except herself though….I remember one time when we were in middle school we had an assignment that required us to draw a picture of ourselves….you're probably thinking <i>"why is this relevant?"</i> well anyways when Ava saw her drawing she started crying because apparently it looked nothing like what she thought it would look like…<br><br><b>..Dr.: </b>Oh my god…..that must have been tough on her..did anyone try and help her out or anything ? You mentioned that there was an incident involving Ava recently can you tell me more about that ? *At this point Mr.: looks visibly uncomfortable again but composes himself quickly.* . . . . .: Ok ok sorry i guess i'm being silly! So yeah there was an incident where all of our friends went camping together in [REDACTED] forest for a week or two ,and one night while everyone else was asleep Ava woke up screaming ,she said something along the lines of <i>"the trees are talking"</i> then ran outside into the woods naked screaming at random intervals throughout the night until eventually some men from [REDACTED] found us and took us back home….we never talked about what happened during those few days afterwards but i think we all knew deep down inside that something wasn't right with our dear sweet Ava anymore……afterwards everyone avoided talking to her because they were scared of upsetting here even more than they already had……i tried reaching out once or twice but every time i did she just pushed me away telling me not talk to here anymore……it broke my heart seeing how sad my best friend became after all those years…..and now here we are today with only memories left behind by our dear sweet lost girl…… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After interviewing Mr.: It has become clear that <i>SCP-15331</i>'s mental state deteriorated significantly after exposure during its encounter with SCP-XXXX<br><br><h3>Addendum 15332.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15332-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15332</i> and D-929.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-929 is to talk to <i>SCP-15332</i> for 30 minutes, then leave the room. D-929 is not allowed to speak about the experiment with anyone else, and must wear earplugs at all times while in the vicinity of <i>SCP-15332</i>. The experiment will be repeated every week for a month.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After talking with <i>SCP-15332</i> for approximately 10 minutes, D-929 began screaming incoherently and attempted to attack <i>SCP-15332</i>. Guards were able to subdue him before he could do any damage. After being restrained, he was given amnestics and returned to his cell without incident.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that even indirect contact with SCP can cause some sort of mental trauma in humans . - Dr ████████</div>
