Its only weakness is its bad domain name management pratices</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-23856<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-23856</i> is a software application designed to generate random SCP objects. It has no graphical user interface, and instead relies on a command line interface for input and output. The application can generate both anomalous items as well as mundane ones, with the latter being more common.<br><br>The codebase of <i>SCP-23856</i> is robust and reliable; it has never experienced any form of failure or malfunction in testing so far. However, its domain name management practices are suboptimal; the app often generates domains that have already been registered by other entities, resulting in potential conflicts with existing sites or services.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-23856</i> is to be kept on a secure server in the Foundation's datacenter. Access to the application should only be granted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any domains generated by <i>SCP-23856</i> are to be registered and monitored by Foundation personnel, and any conflicts with existing sites or services should be resolved as soon as possible.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 23856.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, the application was used to generate SCP-████, a Keter-class anomaly. The generated domain name conflicted with an existing website, and the Foundation had to purchase the domain in order to contain it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23856.2: </h3> Interview with Developer<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Dr. ████, the developer of <i>SCP-23856</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Agent ██████<br><b><br>Agent ██████:</b> So, Doctor, can you tell us a bit about how <i>SCP-23856</i> works? <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> Sure. The application uses a complex algorithm to generate random objects with varying levels of anomalous properties and characteristics. It then stores these objects in its internal database before outputting them as text files or HTML documents for further review by personnel. <br><b><br>Agent ██████:</b> And what about domain name management? How does that work? <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> Well, the app is designed to generate random domains using various top-level domains, such as .com or .org. However, due to the random nature of the generation process, it's possible that these domains may already be registered by other entities. In this case, we recommend that personnel manually resolve any conflicts before using them in any way.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23856.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> <i>SCP-23856</i> was used to generate 10 random SCP objects. The domains associated with each object were then registered and monitored by Foundation personnel.<br><b><br>Results:</b> All 10 generated objects were classified as Safe, and all associated domains were successfully registered without any conflicts.</div>
