<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-29274 is a species of nematode with an extraordinary capacity for absorbing and storing water. These organisms are approximately 5 centimeters in length when fully hydrated but can contract to microscopic sizes when desiccated. SCP-29274 displays behaviors that suggest a basic level of group coordination and potentially rudimentary intelligence.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, SCP-29274 lives in a dormant state deep within the soil. However, it becomes highly active in the presence of moisture. Its hydration cycle is extraordinarily efficient, enabling SCP-29274 colonies to deplete groundwater, surface water, and even moisture within living organisms at an accelerated pace, often leading to severe ecological repercussions.</p>
<p>SCP-29274's most alarming feature is its ability to replicate the cellular structure of plant roots on its outer epidermis, allowing for the stealthy infiltration of plant-based ecosystems and accelerated water extraction from the soil and roots themselves. This mimetic capability has made SCP-29274 a severe threat to agriculture and natural habitats, necessitating rigorous containment measures.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Area-29274 has been established around the initial discovery site of SCP-29274 in [REDACTED], encompassing a 50-kilometer radius to create a buffer zone. The perimeter is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel equipped with moisture detection equipment and infrared scanners to identify SCP-29274 activity.</p>
<p>Foundation hydrologists are to maintain a controlled micro-irrigation system within the containment area to keep SCP-29274 colonies contained, precisely calibrated to sustain SCP-29274 without allowing overpopulation or spread. Deployment of false 'root networks' made from biodegradable polymers saturated with moisture is approved as a means to distract and trap SCP-29274 colonies.</p>
<p>Any water sources discovered to have been compromised by SCP-29274 are to be isolated, and the affected water is to be removed and replaced with an isotopically-marked substitute that allows for tracking SCP-29274's movements and growth patterns. All plant life suspected of being a host to SCP-29274 is to be incinerated.</p>
<p>In case of a breach or uncontained spread beyond Area-29274, MTF Beta-4 ("Aqua Purifiers") are to be dispatched for immediate containment using specialized equipment, including dehydration foam and electromagnetic pulse generators that disrupt SCP-29274's nervous system.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery Log</h3>
<p><strong>Addendum 1-A -</strong> Incident Report
SCP-29274 was first identified following an ecological disaster in [REDACTED] where an entire lake system was found completely dried overnight. Initial investigations by local authorities revealed desiccated fish and wildlife, along with a severely wilted plant ecosystem. The Foundation was alerted after local reports described the soil as "hissing" and appearing to "drink the rain."</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1-B -</strong> Field Notes
Upon arrival, Foundation researchers discovered the presence of SCP-29274. Samples were collected for study while containment protocols were immediately instituted. Interviews with survivors from a village near the epicenter reported instances of plant-life wilting at an accelerated rate and sensations of dehydration despite adequate water intake prior to the incident. These testimonies were instrumental in understanding SCP-29274's capabilities and impact.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<p><strong>Addendum 2-A -</strong> Experiment 29274-E01
Objective: To observe SCP-29274's response to a controlled water source.
Procedure: SCP-29274 samples were placed in a terrarium with a regulated dripping system to simulate rain.
Result: SCP-29274 quickly aggregated near the water source. Absorption rates were higher than any known terrestrial species, culminating in the complete evaporation of water within minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2-B -</strong> Experiment 29274-E02
Objective: To test SCP-29274's interaction with plant life.
Procedure: A variety of plant species were introduced to a contaminated soil sample.
Result: SCP-29274 rapidly integrated into the plant root systems, leading to widespread wilting and death of the plants. The use of SCP-29274 mimetic structures was confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2-C -</strong> Experiment 29274-E03
Objective: To evaluate potential containment breach responses.
Procedure: A small-scale model environment was subjected to a simulated containment breach.
Result: SCP-29274 spread was far more aggressive than predicted, prompting a review and overhaul of containment procedures. Lessons from the experiment have been integrated into current protocols.</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Reports and Containment Breach Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Addendum 3-A -</strong> Incident 29274-A
Details: A minor breach occurred when a containment perimeter was compromised due to heavy rainfall. SCP-29274 colonies migrated towards a nearby river system before being contained.
Response: MTF Beta-4 successfully reestablished containment utilizing dehydration foam tactics. Revised perimeter defenses now include automated weather response systems.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3-B -</strong> Future Containment Considerations
The Foundation is currently researching genetic and biological countermeasures to SCP-29274, including potential bioengineered predators, targeted viruses, and chemical deterrents. However, the high adaptability of SCP-29274 remains a significant obstacle to these efforts.</p>
<p>Ongoing observations suggest SCP-29274 may be evolving a resistance to current containment methods. Continued vigilance and scientific research are imperative to stay ahead of this threat. As per the O5 Councilâ€™s latest directive, any new developments in SCP-29274 behavior patterns or containment strategies are to be reported immediately for review and potential integration into Special Containment Procedures.</p>
