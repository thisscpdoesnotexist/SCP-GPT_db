It consists of four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, with no instruments or vocals present.<br><br>When performed, <i>SCP-23926</i> will cause all sentient creatures within a 10 kilometer radius to become entranced in an unending loop of the song, unable to move or speak until the song has ended. Once it has ended, all affected individuals will return to their normal state of consciousness with no memory of what had occurred during the performance.<br><br>The only known way to break this effect is for someone outside the affected area to actively disrupt the performance before its conclusion. This can be achieved through any means necessary such as playing another sound over top of it or physically destroying any instrument used in its performance.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-23926</i> is to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Any attempts to perform or record the composition must be approved by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any individuals affected by <i>SCP-23926</i> are to be monitored for any long term psychological effects and provided appropriate treatment if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23926.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-23926</i> on non-sentient creatures. The results showed that while animals were not entranced by the song, they did display an increased aggression towards any individual performing or attempting to perform <i>SCP-23926</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23926.2: </h3> Interview with John Cage<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> John Cage, composer of <i>SCP-23926</i>.<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview conducted in order to gain insight into <i>SCP-23926</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Good morning, Mr. Cage. Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Could you please tell me why you composed this piece?<br><b><br>John Cage:</b> Well, I wanted to create something that would challenge people's expectations of what music is and can be. I thought it would be interesting to see how people reacted when presented with a composition that was completely silent and still managed to evoke emotion from its listeners. <br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Interesting… Do you have any idea why it has the anomalous effects it does? <br><b><br> John Cage:</b> No, I'm afraid not. When I composed it, I had no idea that it would have such an effect on people. <br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Do you have any advice for those affected by <i>SCP-23926</i>? <br><b><br>John Cage:</b> Yes, stay calm and try to remember that this is only temporary. The effects will pass eventually and you'll be back to normal soon enough.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> Interview concluded without incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23926.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>A test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-23926</i> on non-sentient creatures. A group of ten dogs were exposed to a live performance of <i>SCP-23926</i>, and all ten were observed to become entranced in an unending loop until the song had ended. As with sentient creatures, no long term psychological effects were observed in any of the animals after the experiment concluded.</div>
