At this point , subject began complaining about having a headache and nausea . After another period of time had elapsed , subject began vomiting profusely while continuing to complain about his head hurting more and more as well as feeling nauseous . After yet another period of time had elapsed , subject began screaming uncontrollably while attempting to claw at his own eyes out from the pain he felt from his headache before collapsing onto the floor after becoming unconscious due to said pain which caused him not being able to see anything nor hear anything for that matter either whatsoever either whatsoever either whatsoever either whatsoever either whatsoever either whatsoever < End Log > Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Upon further inspection it has been discovered that 15556's fangs are directly connected into its brain which means that 15556 could potentially bite itself in half if given enough incentive or reason too do so.
