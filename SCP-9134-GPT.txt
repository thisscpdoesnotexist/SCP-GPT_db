The object bears no anomalous properties if worn on the right hand, and has no effect if removed. Wearing <i>SCP-9134</i> on the left hand activates its anomalous properties.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> uyfuyfgusdsggfasgafsasfdasgsdgasdfgadsfgd asdassdf sdf<br><br><i>SCP-9134</i> is a ring made from an unknown material. The object's anomalous properties do not manifest until worn on the left hand. When worn, information about the wearer seems to be distorted in visual media, such as photographs and videos, to make it appear that they are wearing <i>SCP-9134</i> on their right hand. For example, CCTV footage of subjects wearing <i>SCP-9134</i> will show them wearing their left hand through a perspective consistent with a right-handed perspective. Subjects observed from behind will consistently show <i>SCP-9134</i> being worn on the right hand even when observed from multiple angles or without line of sight. Subjects observed from behind will also report that they are observing themselves from behind while wearing <i>SCP-9134</i> . Subjects have been prevented from viewing themselves in mirrors while under the effect of <i>SCP-9134</i> , but have reported seeing their reflection as obscured by reflections of other objects around them consistent with being covered by an opaque object such as a bag or cloth. Photographs and videos taken during this time appear normal for subjects who are not under the effect of <i>SCP-9134</i> .<br><br>+ Addendum 9/11/20██ - Hide Subsequent testing has shown that once removed (whether voluntarily or involuntarily), subjects report no longer experiencing any anomalous effects of <i>SCP-</i> 9 134 until rewearing it again, even if at different times than previous wearings (such as immediately after removal). However, reports indicate that subjects still perceive subjects not under its effects to act abnormally; for example , one test subject reported believing his coworker was taking pictures of him constantly during work hours despite working with him throughout more than half his shifts at regular intervals over several months without incident before beginning testing with SC P - 9 134 . These effects seem to persist after cessation or reduction in use; test subject D█ T█████ continued to experience these symptoms up until his death due to brain cancer five years after ceasing regular use o f SC P - 9 134 , despite no longer having contact with any individuals who use d t he object regularly nor having contact w ith any data regarding t he presence o f t he anomaly . Given these results, further testing involving repeated use is suspended indefinitely pending review by onsite medical staff and O5 personnel for possible longterm cognitive health issues associated th erewith This document<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9134</i> was recovered in █████, ██ on 7/██/20██ after several reports of individuals acting erratically were linked to the presence of <i>SCP-9134</i> in nearby stores. The object was recovered after images taken by nearby CCTV cameras displayed evidence of <i>SCP-</i> 9 134 ' s anomalous properties. A Foundation agent embedded with the local police department contacted nearby Site 19 and an investigation team was dispatched to recover the object.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9134.1 :</h3> Excerpts from Test Log 9134-1<br><br>+ Show Transcript of Test Log 9134-1 - Hide Transcript of Test Log 9134-1 DATE TEST SUBJECT NOTES 7/██/<br>20██ D█ T█████ Note: First test involving <i>SCP-9134</i> usage by subject.

It's pretty weird.. Maybe I'm just used to seeing it that way? Or maybe because my memory says it looks like that? Just thinking out loud… (pauses) No , this isn't right at all… It should be backwards..(subject takes one step forward) Ahhh, much better now! That's weird!
