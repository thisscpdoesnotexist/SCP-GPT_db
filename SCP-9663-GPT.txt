The shoes have no brand name, and it is unknown who made them.<br><br>When worn on the feet of an individual, they will feel more relaxed than usual. After wearing <i>SCP-9663</i> for 5 minutes or longer, the subject will become drowsy and fall asleep if he/she does not move away from the place where <i>SCP-9663</i> was placed before this occurs. This effect lasts for 8 hours after wear stops; if wear continues beyond that period of time, then both feet will turn into soil at least 1 week later (See Addendum).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> A pair of <i>SCP-9663</i> was found in the basement of an abandoned apartment building. Security cameras show that a woman wearing <i>SCP-9663</i> walked out of the building on February ██, 20██.<br><br><i>SCP-9663</i>'s effect was discovered when Dr. ████████ and his assistant Ms. █████████ entered the basement of Building 16 during an investigation on reports from neighbors about a <i>"weird smell"</i>. Both showed signs of confusion after entering the room where <i>SCP-9663</i> were kept, and were subsequently escorted out by security personnel investigating the cause of their confusion.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9663.1 :</h3><br><br><br>Test Logs: Test Log 9663-01<br><br><br>Subject: D-5848, a 32 year old male. Prior criminal record for assault and battery.<br><br><br>Procedure: Subject was instructed to wear <i>SCP-9663</i> for 3 hours in a room of Site-19 with no other anomalous objects. Subject complied without any signs of stress, and reported feeling sleepy after 2 hours. Subject fell asleep 1 hour later, and slept in the same position until he woke up 8 hours later at 0900 on February ██, 20██. The subject stated that he had the <i>"best sleep he ever had"</i>. Test Log 9663-02<br><br><br>Subject: D-148052 , a 27 year old female convicted for drug trafficking and possession charges. Prior psychological issues include depression and anxiety disorder related to her arrest . DCI by prior owner of <i>SCP-9663</i> before Foundation custody. Object Class upgraded from Safe to Euclid when she entered Site 19 wearing <i>SCP-9663</i> while being escorted by two security personnel due to her resistance towards arrest . Security footage shows that the object was discovered on October 17th 1999 on a sidewalk outside an apartment building in ██████████ by one Ms./ Dr███████, who was delivering newspapers at the time (see Addendum 9663/2). No information is available about how she obtained it or why she would want it; however, given her history of mental health issues related as well as substance abuse (drugs seized during investigation were found positive for cocaine), it is theorized that these factors may have influenced how she perceived <i>SCP-</i>[DATA EXPUNGED]. Dr███████ noted its unusual nature but did not contact law enforcement authorities or attempt to have them investigate further before bringing it back home; this decision has been considered instrumental in allowing several more people to view/use [DATA EXPUNGED] before discovery by the Foundation under Incident Report IR99999A1 . Due to inconsistencies between known physical laws regarding distribution of mass relative to gravity (see incident report IR99999A1), [REDACTED] from witnessing what happened next; however, video footage recovered from Building 16's security camera shows Ms./Dr███████ using [REDACTED]to carry several gallon sized bags which contained what appeared be human remains into one of three apartments located at Floor 4F via elevator around 0230 whereupon they remained there until their discovery at 1130PM on October 18th 1999 during an unrelated investigation into reports made by neighbors about <i>"weird noises"</i> emanating from this floor over night (by order of Director S████). In addition Researcher █████████ has confirmed seeing multiple anomalies including but not limited too spatial distortions approximately 1 meter wide within this apartment during his brief examination which lasted 10 minutes only( see attached photos). He also hinted towards encountering another entity sharing space with him within said apartment although this statement cannot be confirmed as Researcher █████████ showed signs consistent with sleep deprivation upon leaving said premises around 0345AM<br><br><h3>Addendum 9663.2 :</h3><br><br><br>Note: The following is a transcript of the security footage displaying how <i>SCP-9663</i> came into Foundation custody.<br><br>[BEGIN LOG]<br> Security Camera 1: Dr. ████████ and Ms. █████████ enter the basement of Building 16 at 0211, after they were escorted out by security guards investigating the cause of their confusion (see Test Log 9663-01).<br><br><br>Security Camera 3: Dr. ████████ and Ms. █████████ start looking around in a room where <i>SCP-9663</i> are kept, while Security Guard M███████ keeps watch at the door to prevent them from leaving until they have regained their senses or been taken away for questioning and further investigation as necessary/possible. Dr ████████ examines an object that looks like a pot or pan for about 5 minutes before moving on to another one which she picks up without hesitation; she seems to be more focused on examining this object than before, although it is unknown what she is doing exactly because her back is turned towards the camera at this point .<br><br><br>Security Camera 4: After placing the object down again, Ms. █████████ turns around and sees <i>SCP-9663</i> . While she looks confused by its presence there , she does not seem surprised or startled as someone would if he/she had never seen it before (see addendum 9673); instead, her first response appears to be trying over several times to pick up or touch it , which turns</div>
