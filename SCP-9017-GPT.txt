He is able to make genius inventions with the least amount of materials possible. <i>SCP-9017-GPT</i> also has amazing intelligence, he can decipher codes and ciphers in seconds, he has memorized every object in the world and what they do, and can solve complex math equations in his head faster than a calculator.<br><br>SCP 9127 - Keter<br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> SCP 9127 is to be kept at Site ██ under constant surveillance. All personnel are not allowed to bring any materials that could possibly be used as a weapon inside of SCP 9127's containment chamber. If personnel have brought any weapons with them when entering SCP 9127's containment chamber they must put said weapons through an x-ray machine before being allowed access inside of it. In case of containment breach all on site security staff are permitted to use lethal force against it until recapture has been achieved by Mobile Task Force Epsilon 6 <i>"Mole Rats"</i>. Subjects that have been exposed or infected with SCP 9127 are contained at site ██'s medical bay until termination via incineration can be achieved. No further testing may take place on D Class Personnel for this anomaly unless given permission from either O5 level staff or project head Dr [INSERT NAME]. <h3><br>Description:</h3> SCP 9127 is a sentient entity composed entirely out of various human body parts which includes but not limited to eyes, ears, noses, fingers and toes among others which inhabitates within the bodies of dead humans that were abandoned after dying from their original cause such as suicide or severe wounds caused by torture among other things including war however there have been some cases where it would inhabit living persons instead even though no deaths occurred due to said person being inhabited but if this happens then all signs point towards them attempting suicide somehow.. . Upon death the subject will undergo dissection via an unknown method and stop bleeding instantly while their vital organs such as their brains will cease functioning despite appearing alive while all other major organs appear unharmed according to visual examinations performed on said subjects post autopsy yet upon closer inspection strange anomalous effects begin occurring around these specific areas such as strange like like anomalies appearing instead around the subjects skin which seems very similar but not completely identical like how two different people who look exactly alike would except for minor differences such as freckles birthmarks scars tattoos etc along with internal organs having slight discolor<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> SCP 9127 was discovered after reports of a <i>"zombie invasion"</i> in ██████, Mexico were reported to the Foundation. MTF Epsilon 6 <i>"Mole Rats"</i> were sent in to investigate and after finding out that it was connected with SCP 9127 they contained all civilians inside their homes while task force members entered the town and attempted to capture SCP 9127. After a brief struggle they managed to capture it and transported it back to Site ██ for containment.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9017.1 :</h3> SCP 9127 Interview<br><br><br>Foreword: The following interview is between Dr.█████ and SCP 9127. <Begin Log><br><br>Dr.█████: So SCP 9127, why do you kill people?<br> SCP 9127: I don't know, I just do! Dr.█████: Can you tell me anything about your origin? How did you come to be here?<br> SCP 9127: No idea doc, I've been like this as long as I can remember! And please stop calling me that number they gave me! My name is ███████████ Dr.█████: What were you doing before getting found by the foundation? You know it's likely that they'll try to terminate all of us if we give them any information on our origins due to their <i>"no risk no reward"</i> policy especially since we're technically not human anymore.. . . ███████████: Well…I was killing people mostly but sometimes animals too and sometimes myself too and maybe some other stuff too but mostly killing though yeah definitely most of the time it was definitely definitely 100% completely focused on killing everything in sight so yeah totally nothing else at all except for that haha guess that makes sense considering what happened right? Hahaha oh man this reminds me of my first night as a pickle though boy those were good times *laughs*. Dr .█████ : Um…are there any specific reasons why humans are your main source of prey aside from the fact that we're easy targets for a serial killer like yourself or perhaps because we've made ourselves an easy target for serial killers like yourself.. ? ███████████ : Not really no it's mostly cause your bodies make pretty good homes ya'know plus murderin' humans gives off this great feeling inside ya'know especially after feeding off them and absorbing their nutrients despite being fully sentient yet being unable to move or talk let alone defend themselves yet still being conscious enough to feel pain every single day only serving as an empty shell while having my consciousness float around inside said empty shell which feels similar yet different than how living beings would feel due to not having a physical body anymore which actually makes sense considering how i'm currently inhabiting said body instead but anyways best feeling ever during my life which kinda sucks now since im just hovering around in here with nothing really much can do except talk with others but lately i've been feeling kind of lonely..<br><br><End Log><br> Closing Statement : After analyzing the current situation regarding <i>SCP-9017-GPT</i>'s containment procedures along with recent developments regarding its personality structure along with his apparent loneliness issues along with his increased hostility towards personnel caused by his prolonged stay within Site ██ among other things lead O5 command take action against him under suspicion of possible breach attempt via espionage or sabotage or even worse assassination attempt by O5 level personnel thus resulting in immediate termination via incineration followed by disposal at site ██'s mass grave alongside slain personnel killed during the aforementioned containment breach attempt including Mobile Task Force Epsilon<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9017.2 :</h3> Incident Log<br><br>Incident 9017/1 - Date ██/██/████: During a routine inspection of SCP 9127's containment chamber it became hostile and escaped from its containment chamber via unknown means. It proceeded to kill 5 task force members before being neutralized by security staff.
