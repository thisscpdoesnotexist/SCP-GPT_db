She is to be given a daily dose of Class-A amnestics, and any personnel who come into contact with her are to be given the same dosage.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10561</i> is a woman who's perpetually on fire. The fire does not harm her, but she is harmed by any attempts to douse it. <i>SCP-10561</i> was discovered in the town of ██████, New York, after reports of a <i>"burning woman"</i> were reported to local authorities.<br><br><i>SCP-10561</i> has been able to communicate with Foundation personnel through written notes and gestures; however, she has refused to answer questions regarding how the fire started or if it can be put out. She also refuses all offers of medical treatment for burns that cover her body (see Addendum 10561-02).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10561.1 : </h3>【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10561</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-10561</i>. I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself and how you ended up in the town of ████. <br><br><b><i>SCP-10561</i>: </b>Go ahead, I guess… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you tell me your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10561</i>: </b>No, sorry. [<i>SCP-10561</i> shrugs] It's not that I don't want to tell you… it's just that my name is a secret now, so if anyone asks me what it is they'll find out who I am and then they'll know what happens to people who try to put out my fire… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then; can you at least tell me where you're from? <i>SCP-10561</i> nods her head 'yes'. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview, it was decided that all future interviews with 10561 would be carried out by D-class personnel under the guise of Foundation agents until further notice; as such information is deemed unnecessary for containment purposes at this time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10561.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-10561</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> D-10561 </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>D-10561: </b>So, uh… what's your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10561</i>: </b>I told you already, it's a secret. <br><br><b>D-10561: </b>Oh yeah, sorry. Anyway… how'd you get like this? [<i>SCP-10561</i> shrugs] I mean, are you from around here or something? <i>SCP-10561</i> shakes her head 'no'. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview it was decided that future interviews with 10561 would be carried out by trained personnel in the event that she is unable to communicate with the interviewer through gestures and written notes; as such information is deemed necessary for containment purposes at this time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10561.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10561-01:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10561</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-class personnel is instructed to extinguish the flames on <i>SCP-10561</i>'s body with a fire extinguisher. The subject is then to attempt to put out the fire with his hands. If successful, the subject will be instructed to repeat this process until he cannot put out any more of the flames. If unsuccessful, the subject will be instructed to continue until he can no longer stand due to heat exhaustion or burns.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject was able to successfully put out all of <i>SCP-10561</i>'s flames after approximately three minutes and thirty seconds of continuous spraying. Subject had second degree burns over 30% of his body, but was otherwise uninjured; however, after being informed that he had succeeded in putting out her fire, <i>SCP-10561</i> began screaming in pain and begging for help until sedated by medical staff . Upon examination it was discovered that she has second degree burns over 90% of her body .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that 10561's ability does not allow her wounds from attempting dousing herself with water or other liquids (see Experiment Logs 10562 through 10565) heal; however , they do not seem to worsen either (see Experiment Logs 10566 through 10568). Further testing is required before we can determine if this ability has any limits or how long it will take for these injuries heal on their own .<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>10563-01: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>D -class personnel as per Experiment 10561 - 01 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As per previous experiment , but using water instead of a fire extinguisher <br><br><b>Results: </b>As per previous experiment <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>See above<br><br>Experiment 10564 - 01 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D -class personnel as per Experiment 10563 - 01 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As per previous experiment , but using gasoline instead of water <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately one minute and fifteen seconds , all flames were extinguished . However , upon further examination it was determined that all skin tissue on SCP - 1056 1 ' s left arm had been burned off at some point during the test ; however she did not seem aware or conscious enough at this time for us t o determine when exactly this occurred <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that while gasoline does indeed put out her flame s very quickly , they also cause severe damage t o h er bod y when used in such a way ; therefore I would highly recommend against using flammable liquids as a means for neutralizing an instance if possible . ~~Dr. ██████</div>
