He's just like his mother, always running off without thinking about the consequences! I tried looking for him for years, but he never came back. Then one day I found this portal gun on the ground and figured it would be useful in finding my grandson again. So here I am now, trying to make a difference in this world by stopping all these anomalies from harming people!</div>
