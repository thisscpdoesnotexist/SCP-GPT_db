It has been contained by the Foundation since ██/██/201█.<br><br><i>SCP-15064</i> was first discovered in █████, California after it had gained large amount of money through trading Bitcoin on various exchanges. <i>SCP-15064</i> was contained after an incident where it predicted that Bitcoin would crash to $0 within two days and sold all its holdings, causing a panic among other traders and causing the price to plummet within two days. The Foundation managed to contain <i>SCP-15064</i> before any major damage could be done.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15064.1 : </h3>█████████, ████<br><br>On ██/██/201█, the Foundation used <i>SCP-15064</i> to predict the results of the 2016 US presidential election. It predicted that Donald Trump would win by a landslide and gave odds of 1:1. This prediction was made public and caused a large amount of media attention. The Foundation then used this attention to manipulate voters into voting for Donald Trump in order to further its goals.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15064.2 : </h3>Interview with █████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15064</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after it had predicted the results of the 2016 US presidential election. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: <i>SCP-15064</i>, can you tell me how you predicted Donald Trump to win the election? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15064</i>: </b>I don't know how I did it, but I just knew that he would win. It was a very strong feeling that came over me when I woke up on November 8th and checked my phone and saw that he had won Florida by a large margin and then knew that he would be president. Dr. ███: Did you use any outside sources to predict this? Any websites or books or anything like that? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15064</i>: </b>No, nothing like that at all, just my gut feeling about it all really. Dr. ███: Well thank you for your time today, we will be using your services more in the future if we need to predict something again so please don't leave your cell unless told otherwise by one of our staff members okay? <i>SCP-15064</i> nods head and leaves room <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15064.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15064-A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15064</i> and D-9341.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is given a large amount of money and instructed to trade Bitcoin on various exchanges for an entire day. After the trading is done, <i>SCP-15064</i> is asked to predict the price of Bitcoin. The prediction will then be compared with actual prices.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After one day, D-9341 had earned $1 million through trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on various exchanges. When asked to predict the price of Bitcoin, it predicted that it would crash to $0 within two days due to a <i>"major hack"</i>. The Foundation then used this information as an excuse to sell all its holdings in order avoid any major losses when the predicted crash happened. Two days later, Mt Gox suffered a major hack which caused its price to drop from $1750 per BTC down to $1000 per BTC within 2 hours (the original prediction was for a collapse over two days). This caused panic among traders who started selling their holdings at low prices causing further drops in value until the price stabilized at around $500 per BTC after 1 week (the original prediction was for it stabilize at around $200).<br><br>Experiment 15064-B:</div>
