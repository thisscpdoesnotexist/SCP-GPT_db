The subject attempted to crush it under his foot , but failed due to its small size . After three minutes had passed without incident , D - 4341 left the room for 10 seconds before returning . Upon reentry , D - 4341 reported that he had seen two piles of crushed ant carcasses on either side of him when he exited the door ; upon entering again however , only one pile remained . It is believed that after exiting for 10 seconds without being crushed by his own body mass , SCP - 10767 used this time period to move itself from under his foot and crush him instead</div>
