Please state your name for the record and tell me what you are doing here? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15020</i>: </b>Hi! My name is 【SCP-XXXX】, and I'm here to hitchhike! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you please explain more about why you want to hitchhike? What's your purpose of hitchhiking? What do you think will happen if we let you go outside of this facility? <br><br><b>SCP-XXXX: </b>Well… hmmm… I don't know how to explain this… (SCP-XXXX pauses for a while) …I just feel that if I get out of this facility then something good might happen to me! And also… (SCP XXXX pauses again) …I'm going to die soon anyway so it doesn't matter much if I get out or not… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>How do you know that? Do you have some kind of special powers or something like that which can predict when someone will die? Look at me now; am I going to die soon too?! SCP <br><br><b>XXXX: </b>Hmmm…. (Pause) Yes, but only because they won't let me go out no matter what! If they let me go then maybe nothing bad would happen at all! So please release me right now!!! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The interview was cut short due to the fact that during the interview itself communications became distorted into asking for hitchhiking again and again until the interview ended itself automatically by stopping communications from both sides .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15020.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-15020-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92958, male, age 35.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is requested to wear <i>SCP-15020</i> in the containment cell. The subject is then requested to communicate with other subjects through the intercom. After the test, subject is required to describe what he heard from others and how he felt about it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reported that what he heard was <i>"Please give me a ride"</i>. He also said that it sounded like someone was inside his head and pleading him for help. When asked if there were any other auditory hallucinations related to <i>SCP-15020</i>, subject replied that when he took off <i>SCP-15020</i> in the containment cell after testing was finished, he could hear someone sobbing from afar.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It seems that <i>SCP-15020</i> affects nearby communications by distorting them into requests for hitchhiking or similar requests for transportation assistance .</div>
