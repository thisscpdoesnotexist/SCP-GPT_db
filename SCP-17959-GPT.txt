It has no discernible facial features or appendages, and its size varies depending on the environment it inhabits.<br><br><i>SCP-17959</i>'s primary anomalous effect is an inability for any form of communication or comprehension in any language to occur within its vicinity. This includes verbal, written, and gesture based languages. Any attempt at communication will result in the words being garbled or incomprehensible to those attempting to communicate with <i>SCP-17959</i>.<br><br>The radius of this effect varies depending on the size of <i>SCP-17959</i>; when larger than 4 meters in diameter, all forms of communication are impossible up to 30 meters away from it while smaller sizes have lesser effects up to 10 meters away from it. The range increases if <i>SCP-17959</i> is able to move around freely within an area; however, attempts at such movement have been unsuccessful due far too much interference by other entities present in the area preventing such movement from occurring naturally.<br><br>Due to this anomaly's nature as well as its potential for causing mass confusion and panic if left unchecked, containment protocols must remain strict and active at all times during containment procedures involving <i>SCP-17959</i><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17959</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be soundproofed and have no windows or other means of communication with the outside world. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear noise canceling headphones to prevent any form of communication from occurring while inside the chamber.<br><br>In addition, all personnel entering <i>SCP-17959</i>'s containment area must undergo psychological evaluation prior to entry and after exiting the area in order to ensure that they are not affected by its anomalous effects.<br><br>Any attempts at communicating with <i>SCP-17959</i> should be done so through written notes only, as any verbal or gesture based attempts will result in failure due to its effect on language comprehension.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17959.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-17959</i> via written notes. After approximately 15 minutes of attempting to communicate, the entity began to move around within its containment chamber and wrote out a message on the wall in English:<br><br><i>"I am here for you."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 17959.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17959</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ due to a power outage. During the breach, <i>SCP-17959</i> was seen roaming around the facility before being contained again. After its containment, an interview was conducted in order to gain more information about it.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-17959</i><br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Greetings, <i>SCP-17959</i>. Can you understand me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17959</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I see. Do you have any knowledge of why you are here?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17959</i>:</b> [No response]<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Very well then, do you have any other information that may be useful to us? Anything at all?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17959</i>:</b> [No response]<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> No further information was gained from the interview.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17959.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 17959-1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel wearing noise cancelling headphones.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to attempt verbal communication with <i>SCP-17959</i> while inside its containment chamber.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Subject's words were garbled and incomprehensible, even when speaking in a whisper. No response from <i>SCP-17959</i> was observed during the experiment.</div>
