It is currently unknown how <i>SCP-15503</i> was able to breach containment, but it has been confirmed that it has been seen in the city of ████████, California.<br><br><i>SCP-15503</i>'s main anomalous property is that it can create a copy of itself when threatened. <i>SCP-15503</i> will also use this ability to create multiple copies of itself when there are more than one person present. It appears that <i>SCP-15503</i> will always be able to make a copy of itself regardless on what happens to the original instance, even if its destroyed or altered beyond recognition (such as being turned into an animate statue). This process takes approximately 3 seconds and seems to cause no harm or discomfort towards <i>SCP-15503</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-15503</i>'s other anomalous properties manifest when two instances are together in close proximity for longer than 30 minutes at a time and have not moved at all during this time period . After 30 minutes have passed, both instances will begin moving towards each other until they touch one another . Once they touch each other , both instances will then merge into one single entity with all previous memories and abilities from both entities . The new entity created by doing this has been given the designation SCP - 15 503 - 2 . If either instance moves before merging occurs , both instances will become hostile towards each other and try to attack until they merge again or one instance is destroyed . Once merged , only two entities can exist at once ; if another instance merges with an already existing merged entity , the newly merged entity will gain control over all three bodies while destroying any previous ones (see Incident 15 503 - 1 ) . When two separate entities come into contact with each other after merging , they immediately become hostile towards each other until either one is destroyed or they merge back together again (see Incident 15 503 - 2 ). If any part of either instance remains after merging occurs (such as if only half an arm remains), then those parts may still exhibit anomalous properties similar to those exhibited by SCP - 15 503 prior to its initial containment ; however, these properties seem weaker than before (See Experiment Logs 15 503 A through D ) . Additionally, these parts may continue moving on their own after coming into contact with others even after being separated from their original host body for extended periods of time ; however, these movements seem random and do not appear directed at anything in particular (See Experiment Logs 14 853<br><br><h3>Addendum 15503.2 : </h3>Interview with  SCP - 15 503<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15503</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to gain more information about <i>SCP-15503</i>'s anomalous properties. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-15503</i> . My name is Dr. █████, and I will be conducting your interview today. Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b><i>SCP-15503</i>: </b>Hi! My name is Magolor the sorcerer! It's nice to meet you! <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Yes… yes it is… Now, I would like to ask you a few questions regarding your anomalous properties if that's okay with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15503</i>: </b>Oh sure thing! Ask away!<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Alright then… First question; how did you come into containment?<br><br>SCP - 15 503: Well , it all started when I was summoned by this really cool looking book ! I thought that it would be fun to go on an adventure , so I went along with it . We went through a portal in the middle of nowhere and ended up here ! It was pretty cool at first , but then we got attacked by these weird creatures called <i>"Gordos"</i> . They kept trying to eat me and my friends , so we had no choice but to fight back ! After a while of fighting them off though , they suddenly stopped attacking us for some reason and just flew away somewhere else . Then this guy appeared out of nowhere and told us that we were all free now ; he even gave me this awesome hat as proof of our freedom ! He said his name was Kirby … or something like that … Anyway , after he left we decided that it would probably be best if we came back here since none of us could remember where exactly <i>"here"</i> even was in the first place … So yeah … That's how I got here …<br><br>Dr . <br><br><b>█████: </b>Hmm… Very interesting indeed…. Next question; what are your thoughts on being contained at Site - 19 ?<br><br>SCP - 15 503: Welllllll….. ( At this point there is silence from both parties for approximately 5 minutes ) Uh…. Ummmmm….. You see doctor…… ( Another 5 minutes pass before any response comes from either party ) Ummmmm…….. Do you think maybe someone else could ask me these questions instead ? ( There is silence once again ) Dr . ██: Um…. Excuse me ? Did you say something just now ? ( Silence once again ) Okay then…. Let's move on shall we? How do each instances feel about merging together into one entity? Do they have any opinions on this matter or views regarding their own existence as separate entities prior merging occurs?<br><br>SCP - 15 503: Welllll…….. Again, let me think about what i'm going to say before i say anything…….. Ummmmmmmm………… Welllll………… ( Silence once again fills the room for another 5 minutes ). Okayyyy…… Let's seeeee………………………………………………………………………………………………... Each instance likes being merged together because its fun having multiple bodies instead of only one body ; however, sometimes when two instances merge together they don't always get along well with each other until they get used to each other or one instance gets destroyed somehow ; however, sometimes when two instances merge together there can be problems since only two instances can exist at once so if another instance merges with an already existing merged entity then whoever controls all three bodies gains control over everything while destroying any previous ones which makes things difficult sometimes but its still fun overall because there are more people around who can help out whenever needed !!! Also every time an instance merges with someone else who has previously been merged before them there are no problems whatsoever because everyone involved knows how things work already !!! If anyone has anymore questions please feel free ask them now !! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing notes taken during Experiment Logs 14 853 A through D later interviews were conducted between personnel involved in those experiments in order to confirm whether or not those parts exhibited similar anomalous properties as SCP - 15 503 prior its initial containment; however, none were found present within those parts after coming into contact with others even after being separated from their original host body for extended periods of time which suggests that either those parts lost their previous anomalous properties upon coming into contact with others or never had them in the first place initially due possibly due either weariness towards<br><br><h3>Addendum 15503.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 15 503 A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15503</i>-1 and <i>SCP-15503</i>-2. Both instances are in separate containment cells at Site - 19 . Both instances have been kept in these cells for exactly 30 minutes .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One D - class personnel is to enter the cell of each instance and observe the results .<br><br><b>Results: </b>The two instances immediately began moving towards one another until they touched each other , merging into a single entity with all previous memories and abilities from both entities. This new entity was given the designation SCP - 15 503 - 3 . The entity then proceeded to attack the D - class personnel , but was quickly subdued by security personnel before any major damage could be done.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that when two copies of <i>SCP-15503</i> merge together, they create a new entity with all previous memories and abilities from both entities ; however, it appears that if there are more than two copies present at once, only one copy will survive while the others will be destroyed (see Incident 15 503 - 1 ). This also means that if there are multiple copies present at once, only one copy will ever be able to move around freely ; this does not appear to cause any harm or discomfort towards them (See Experiment Logs 14 853 through 14 853 ) , but this may still pose a problem if multiple copies come into contact with each other after being separated from their original host body for extended periods of time (See Experiment Logs 15 503 B through C ) . It is currently unknown how many copies can exist at once without causing any harm or discomfort towards them.</div>
