<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18830 is  a cat that explodes every 5 minutes</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18830<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18830</i> is a domestic shorthair cat of indeterminate age and breed. It exhibits no anomalous properties aside from its ability to spontaneously explode every 5 minutes, releasing an explosive force comparable to that of a standard hand grenade.<br><br>When <i>SCP-18830</i> explodes, it reforms in the same location within 1 minute, with no apparent physical damage or injury. The cat does not appear to suffer any ill effects from its explosions and is capable of immediately resuming normal activities afterwards.<br><br>The cause of these explosions is currently unknown; however, tests have revealed that they are triggered by certain external stimuli such as loud noises or sudden movements near the cat’s vicinity. Additionally, attempts at containing <i>SCP-18830</i> have proven unsuccessful due to its ability to reform after each explosion.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-18830</i> is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at all times. The chamber must be soundproofed and monitored for any external stimuli that may trigger an explosion. Personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear and take extra precautions when interacting with <i>SCP-18830</i>.<br><br>In the event of an explosion, personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and allow <i>SCP-18830</i> to reform before reentering the containment chamber.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18830.1: </h3><br><br>Due to the danger posed by <i>SCP-18830</i>, personnel are reminded to exercise caution when handling or interacting with it. Additionally, all personnel entering the containment chamber must be briefed on proper safety protocols and wear protective gear at all times.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18830.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. █████<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Dr. █████, researcher assigned to <i>SCP-18830</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Can you tell me more about <i>SCP-18830</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> Of course. As I said, it's a domestic shorthair cat of indeterminate age and breed that spontaneously explodes every 5 minutes with an explosive force comparable to that of a standard hand grenade. We've been unable to determine the cause of these explosions, but they appear to be triggered by certain external stimuli such as loud noises or sudden movements near the cat’s vicinity. Additionally, attempts at containing <i>SCP-18830</i> have proven unsuccessful due to its ability to reform after each explosion.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18830.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18830-1:</b> <i>SCP-18830</i> was placed in a standard containment chamber and monitored for any external stimuli that may trigger an explosion. After 5 minutes, the cat exploded, releasing an explosive force comparable to that of a standard hand grenade. The cat reformed within 1 minute with no apparent physical damage or injury.<br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> <i>SCP-18830</i> appears to explode every 5 minutes regardless of external stimuli.</div>
