The SCP Foundation had discovered <i>SCP-9613</i> in 1997, but the website was quickly taken down by the host after a few weeks. The Foundation got suspicious about it and then found out that one of its members have been secretly working for this unknown entity.<br><br>The website itself is not harmful at all,<br> except for one thing: All users with an IQ of 120 or higher will experience a hallucination when they stare at the screen for longer than 3 minutes. These hallucinations vary from user to user, but usually consist of them being able to see things they normally wouldn't be able to see and also feeling like something has changed without knowing what exactly has changed . It doesn't matter who looks at this website as long as their brain works fine. If someone with an IQ less than 120 tries to access this website then nothing will happen (except for maybe being confused). This can be explained because there's no way anything interesting could possibly come out of their brain… right?<br><br>The reason why these hallucinations affect people with higher IQs more is still unknown although many researchers had tried figuring it out over the years,<br> but there are some theories: Maybe people with higher IQs are more susceptible due to them having less problems in life which might cause them looking into random things on the internet more often or maybe because they are exposed to information which allows them understanding things better than others or maybe because they're just plain crazy and therefore look into random stuff on the internet more often… Or maybe all three reasons combined? ~~N/A~~ ~~N/A~~<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> ~~N/A~~ ~~N/A~~<br><br><h3>Addendum 9613.1 :</h3><br><br>Dr. Johnson, who had been working with the SCP Foundation for a long time now,<br> had shared his personal opinion about this website:<br><br><h3>Addendum 9613.2 :</h3><br><br>Dr. Shindler, who had left the SCP Foundation after a big containment breach in 2011,<br> had shared his personal opinion about this website:</div>
