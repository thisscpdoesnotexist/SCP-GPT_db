Access is restricted to personnel with security codes 9513/1 and 9513/2.~~<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3><br><br><i>SCP-9513</i> is a blue hardcover book with a black spine, measuring 12.5cm x 19.75cm x 2.375cm and weighing 159g. The words <i>"The Collected Works of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian the Wise"</i> are printed on the cover in gold leaf lettering, and the name <i>"Albus Dumbledore"</i> is embossed on the lower left corner of the cover in silver gilt. Two 3mm diameter holes have been bored through pages 1-210, and two further 3mm holes bored through pages 210-423; these appear to be part of <i>SCP-9513</i>'s anomalous properties (see below).<br><br><i>SCP-9513</i> was recovered from the private collection of ██████ ████████████, a wealthy collector of rare books who was found dead at his home in ████, Ireland under unknown circumstances; <i>SCP-9513</i> was found beside his body clutching an identical volume entitled <i>"The Collected Works of Severus Snape"</i>. Further investigation revealed that Mr. ████████████ had recently visited both Scotland and Wales while researching books similar to <i>SCP-9513</i>; on each occasion he travelled alone using public transport or walking long distances but did not specify where he went during these excursions. Foundation agents later discovered that Mr. ████████████ spent significant amounts of time within Edinburgh Castle (Scotland) and Castell Coch (Wales). A review by Foundation historians confirmed no known records exist for either Albus Dumbledore or Severus Snape visiting either location during their lifetimes despite both being born within 100km from Castell Coch .<br><br>When opened, <i>SCP-9513</i> displays several blank pages interspersed with handwritten text which appears to detail [REDACTED] as well as various annotations concerning one [REDACTED]. Pages displaying this text will occasionally shift position when observed directly or indirectly , although it is unclear how this occurs due to there being no discernable mechanism by which this could occur . Subsequently , new handwritten text will sometimes appear between existing paragraphs ; 35% of all new additions make direct reference to [REDACTED], whereas 65% detail other events occurring outside those detailed in previous entries . These changes do not alter any previously recorded information - e.g., information detailing Severus Snape's death still refers to him dying after defecting to Voldemort's side even though such information has been overwritten - but do note if they contradict previously established facts within SCP 95 13 ' s narrative ; however , such contradictions are typically noted<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3><br><br><i>SCP-9513</i> was discovered on the desk in Mr. ████████████'s library , which is currently owned by his son, Mr. ████████████. The Foundation became aware of <i>SCP-9513</i>'s existence as a result of a routine review of literature purchased by high ranking officials within the Ministry of Magic . Due to significant discrepancies between the narrative detailed within <i>SCP-9513</i> and commonly accepted historical fact, it was determined that further investigation was required . Mr. ████████████ expressed willingness to co-operate with Foundation investigators and stated that he has no interest in owning items which could potentially attract unwanted attention from groups such as <i>"You Know Who"</i> or <i>"That Lying Bastard"</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9513.1 :</h3> Excerpt from <i>SCP-9513</i>'s narrative detailing the events leading to Albus Dumbledore's death.<br><br><br>1947: The year in which Albus Dumbledore died. It was a turbulent one, even by wizarding standards, and it marked the end of an era as well as being the beginning of a new one. For years we had enjoyed relative peace under Minister for Magic Ottaline Gambol and her administration; but with her death came a new political climate which gave rise to [REDACTED] whose popularity amongst those who feared that they would be persecuted because of their blood status soared after he defeated [REDACTED] (a werewolf) during an election campaign speech in December 1945 . He soon rose to become Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, where he proved himself time and time again that he was indeed driven by his desire to protect all magical folk regardless of their background - or so it seemed at first. However , after several months on his new role as Minister for Magic , [REDACTED] began making statements about how dangerous creatures such as giants were becoming more powerful throughout Europe due not only to their increase in numbers but also due to them being able to live alongside humans . There were already attacks against muggles reported across the continent - including one near Gothenburg in Sweden where four people died when a pack of three fourteen foot high trolls attacked random passersby on Christmas Eve 1946 - but these attacks did not seem significant enough for most members of society at large ; however this incident changed all that .<br><br>The attack occurred outside Hogrän , home town of then sixteen year old Gretchen Greengrass , daughter if Pius Greengrass who had been serving on the board at Gringotts Wizarding Bank since 1869 . Gretchen had just stepped out into Main Street around 9pm when she heard what sounded like loud footsteps approaching behind her; this prompted her brother Alfredus, who had been waiting slightly further up along Main Street with two friends who were visiting from England named Harold Thomas (aged 17) and James Longbottom (aged 15), along with several local teenagers who happened to be out late including young Martin Wozniak (aged 16), Olaf Kirchermüller (aged 12) and Isabella Kleinberger (aged 11),to investigate what was going on. They found Gretchen lying unconscious next t[sic]e corpse s[sic]f seven dead muggles ; five adults and two children between four and ten years old dressed in peasant clothing lay scattered across the road near an overturned cart containing several crates full of potatoes . At first sight there appeared nothing unusual about them except for minor cuts, bruises or severe bleeding from ears or noses caused by blunt force trauma ; yet they are believed to have been completely petrified rather than killed instantly due any sort f spell or charm used against them given how quickly they appear ed t o have turned t o stone once struck by whatever force flung them into stone before hitting th[sic]<br><br><h3>Addendum 9513.2 :</h3> Excerpt from <i>SCP-9513</i>'s narrative detailing the events leading to Severus Snape's death.</div>
