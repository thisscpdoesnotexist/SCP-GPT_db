The inner walls of the stadium are to be lined with speakers that will play loud music at all times , and any cracks or holes in the outer wall are to be sealed off immediately. Any instances of <i>SCP-15280</i> -1 that emerge from these holes are to be terminated on sight .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15280</i> is the abandoned Tokyo 1882 Olympics stadium. It is a large, circular stadium with a diameter of approximately 100 meters. The stadium consists of an outer wall, which has been damaged and destroyed in several places, and an inner wall, which has also been damaged but to a lesser extent than the outer wall. <i>SCP-15280</i> was discovered in [REDACTED], Japan by MTF Epsilon-8 (<i>"Elysian Fields"</i>). <i>SCP-15280</i> was found to be inhabited by numerous instances of <i>SCP-15280</i>-1.<br><br><i>SCP-15280</i>'s anomalous properties manifest whenever any human being enters within 50 meters of the structure; however, while this effect takes place between humans and <i>SCP-15280</i> itself it does not occur between instances of <i>SCP-15280</i> -1 due to their lack of sapience. When this occurs all humans within 50 meters will experience severe auditory hallucinations that seem to originate from inside their own minds rather than from outside sources; these hallucinations are typically described as loud noises such as claps or gunshots but have also included sounds such as screaming or growling at times . These auditory hallucinations will continue until all humans leave the area around SCP 152 80 .<br><br>SCP 152 80 -1 are humanoid entities that inhabit the interior spaces on both walls surrounding the center area where Olympic events would be held during its time period . Instances have only been observed moving along vertical surfaces , with no evidence suggesting they can move along horizontal surfaces . They appear to be composed entirely out of white smoke , although they are visible through non technological means such as photographs or video recordings . The number and size vary greatly depending on how long they have inhabited said space for , with newer instances appearing smaller than older ones due to them having had less time to grow in size and mass . Upon discovery all instances were measured at approximately 5 cm tall (although some appeared much larger) , however after several months had passed many appeared over 1 meter tall ; it is unknown what causes them to increase in mass except for when new ones emerge from cracks located around the inner walls where new <i>"seats"</i> are located (see addendum 152 80 2). Instances communicate through vocalization only , making loud screeching noises similar in tone with those heard during initial exposure inside stadiums ; most vocalizations consist primarily out of single syllables repeated over and over again ; however occasionally more complex phrases can be heard consisting out multiple syllables although these do not seem directed towards any one individual instance nor do they<br><br><h3>Addendum 15280.1 : </h3>????<br><br>When we first discovered the stadium we thought it was just another abandoned structure , nothing out of the ordinary . Until we started hearing noises . It all started with a few simple sounds, like claps and gunshots . We didn't think much of them at first , but then they got louder and louder until they were so loud that you could barely hear yourself think. We tried to leave the area but no matter where we went it seemed like those noises followed us everywhere. I don't know how long this lasted for , all I remember is that eventually everything went silent and then when I woke up my team was gone… All except for me…<br><br><h3>Addendum 15280.2 : </h3>Interview with ????<br><br><h3>Addendum 15280.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 152 80 -1A: On ██/██/████, D-15280 was instructed to enter <i>SCP-15280</i> and document any anomalous activity. Upon entering the stadium D-15280 reported hearing several loud vocalizations that were similar in tone with those heard during initial exposure inside stadiums . After approximately 4 hours of exploration , D-15280 reported hearing what sounded like a single gunshot . Upon investigation it was discovered that a new instance of <i>SCP-15280</i> -1 had emerged from a crack located on the inner wall directly above where D-15280 was standing at the time , measuring approximately 50 cm tall and 20 cm wide. Experiment 152 80 -1B: On ██/██/████, Agent N█████ entered <i>SCP-15280</i> in order to observe any changes that may have occurred since previous experiment. Upon entering Agent N█████ reported hearing several loud vocalizations that were similar in tone with those heard during initial exposure inside stadiums . After approximately 1 hour of exploration , Agent N█████ reported being approached by an instance of SCP 15280 -1 measuring approximately 1 meter tall and 30 cm wide; however when he attempted to interact with this instance it immediately retreated back into its hole located on the inner wall. Experiment 152 80 -2A: On ██/██/████, two instances (designated as A and B) of SCP 15280 -1 were captured using standard containment procedures after emerging from separate holes located around the outer walls; both instances appeared identical in size (approximately 2 meters tall) but differed slightly in appearance due to one having slightly more white smoke than its counterpart . Both instances were then placed within separate soundproofed containment cells separated by an airtight glass window ; over course of next few weeks both instances grew significantly larger until they reached sizes comparable to their original counterparts (approximately 3 meters tall). Experiment 152 80 -2B: On ██/██ /20 16, two additional instances (designated as C and D) were captured using standard containment procedures after emerging from separate holes located around the outer walls; both instances appeared identical in size (approximately 3 meters tall) but differed slightly in appearance due to one having slightly more white smoke than its counterpart . Both instances were then placed within separate soundproofed containment cells separated by an airtight glass window ; over course of next few weeks both instances grew significantly larger until they reached sizes comparable to their original counterparts (approximately 4 meters tall). Experiment 152 80 -3A: On █ /0 6 /20 19, multiple smaller entities began emerging from cracks located around the inner walls where new <i>"seats"</i> are located at a much faster rate than before ; these smaller entities resembled small versions of previously documented entities except for their lack of facial features or limbs aside from arms which ended abruptly instead extending outwards into points resembling sharpened pencils or spikes ; these smaller entities moved along vertical surfaces using said arms while emitting high pitched screeching noises which increased greatly when exposed towards human subjects rather than remaining consistent throughout entire duration within presence area. These smaller entities appeared much faster moving compared towards previous observed versions , often appearing out side cracks before they could be fully observed through non technological means such as photographs or video recordings . Approximately 5 minutes later all newly emerged smaller entities suddenly retreated back into their respective holes without explanation leaving behind no trace other than increased volume level caused by screeching noises emitted through said holes for remainder duration within presence area.<br></div>
