These edits include, but are not limited to:<br><br>• The addition of a character referred to as <i>"The Shadow"</i>, who appears in all scenes and is always wearing a black hooded cloak. It does not interact with any other characters in the film and its presence goes unnoticed by them.<br><br>• All dialogue spoken by characters has been replaced with nonsensical gibberish, though it still follows basic grammatical rules.<br><br>• All music and sound effects have been replaced with distorted noises similar to those heard during an earthquake or thunderstorm. <br><br>• Several shots have been edited so that they appear much darker than they originally did, making it difficult for viewers to make out what is happening onscreen. <br><br>When viewed, <i>SCP-18073</i> will cause extreme paranoia and fear in subjects who watch it for more than 5 minutes at a time; this effect intensifies over time until subjects become completely catatonic or suffer from severe mental breakdowns if exposed for too long. Subjects affected by <i>SCP-18073</i> will also report feeling like they are being watched while viewing the movie despite there being no one else present in the room with them.  Additionally, when attempting to pause or stop playback of <i>SCP-18073</i> on any device used for viewing purposes, said device will immediately shut down without warning regardless of current power levels or battery life remaining; this effect persists even after attempts have been made to restart said device afterwards.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18073</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times, and access to it is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.
