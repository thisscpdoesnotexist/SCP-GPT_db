The eye will remain stationary for approximately one minute before moving around its environment at high speed, often making contact with objects or individuals present. Upon contact with any object or individual, <i>SCP-18021</i> will cause them to experience intense feelings of fear and panic that last for up to two minutes before dissipating completely.<br><br>The exact purpose of <i>SCP-18021</i> is unknown; however it appears to be linked to some form of competition between rival groups or organizations that are currently unknown. After each manifestation event, reports from witnesses indicate that they felt as if they were being challenged by someone else in their vicinity who was not visible but could be heard whispering words such as “I am the Eye of the Tiger” followed by laughter from an unseen source (presumed to be <i>SCP-18021</i>).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-18021</i>’s manifestations, it is currently impossible to contain or control it. As such, all personnel are advised to remain vigilant and report any sightings of <i>SCP-18021</i> immediately.<br><br>In the event that an individual is affected by <i>SCP-18021</i>’s fear inducing effects, they should be taken away from the area and given a sedative if necessary. All individuals who have been affected by <i>SCP-18021</i> should be monitored for at least 24 hours after contact with the entity in order to ensure that no long term psychological damage has occurred.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18021.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a group of individuals claiming to be members of an organization known as “The Eye of the Tiger” contacted the Foundation and requested to meet with personnel for the purpose of negotiating containment procedures. The request was denied, and all attempts by this organization to contact the Foundation have since been blocked.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18021.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18021</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-18021</i> in an attempt to gain more information about its nature and intentions. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> “Hello, <i>SCP-18021</i>. Can you understand me?”<br><b><br><i>SCP-18021</i>:</b> [silence]<br><b><br>Researcher:</b> “We want to understand why you are here and what your purpose is. Can you tell us anything about that?”<br><b><br><i>SCP-18021</i>:</b> [The eye turns towards the researcher and begins to move around in a circular motion.] “I am the Eye of the Tiger, I am here to challenge those who would stand in my way. I will not rest until I have conquered all adversaries!”<br><br><h3> Addendum 18021.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 18021.3:</b> On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-18021</i> on human subjects. A volunteer subject was placed in a sealed room and instructed to remain still for five minutes while being monitored by security personnel. After three minutes, <i>SCP-18021</i> manifested itself in the corner of the room and began moving around rapidly before making contact with the subject. The subject immediately experienced intense fear and panic before collapsing onto the floor after two minutes had passed. After a further minute, the entity dissipated from view and all symptoms dissipated from the subject soon afterwards.</div>
