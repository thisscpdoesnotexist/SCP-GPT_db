Any unauthorized personnel attempting unauthorized access will be terminated immediately. As this object does not present any danger towards humanity, it will remain under observation until further notice.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9710</i> is a planet that harbor a never seen before ecological civilization. The civilization is made up of multiple species, some of which are sentient and others that are not. The sentient beings are bipedal with two arms and legs, having the appearance of humans but with different skin colorations and eye colors. They also have wings on their backs, ranging from 3 to 13 pairs per individual. <i>SCP-9710</i> also has multiple other species that do not possess sentience such as animals or plants.<br><br>The planet itself is made up of one large landmass surrounded by an ocean with no other islands in sight (See Addendum 9710-1). It has a very thin atmosphere composed mostly out of nitrogen and oxygen, but it lacks any gasses essential for human life such as argon or carbon dioxide (See Addendum 9710-2). There appears to be no source for light on the planet's surface apart from the sun due to the lack of any stars in its sky (See Addendum 9710-3). It orbits around a star roughly 1 AU away from earth every 5 years (See Addendum 9710-4).<br><br><i>SCP-9710</i> was discovered after reports were received by astronomers regarding strange lights appearing on its surface during night time (see Discovery Report below) , prompting an investigation team to be sent there via [REDACTED]. Upon arrival at <i>SCP-9710</i>'s orbit they discovered a single space station orbiting around it at low altitude called <i>"Olympus"</i> . A team was then sent down there where they found several living beings inhabiting it along with several nonliving objects like machinery or vehicles. After establishing contact with these beings they were given Class B amnestics and returned back to earth along with all data gathered about <i>SCP-9710</i> . The space station itself was left intact after being deemed harmless by researchers . All information regarding SCP - 971 0 has been classified under Thaumiel Protocols due to its importance in understanding extraterrestrial life forms as well as Earth's past history . Any unauthorized personnel attempting unauthorized access will be terminated immediately . As this object does not present any danger towards humanity , it will remain under observation until further notice .<br><br>Discovery Report:<br><br><h3>Addendum 9710.1 : </h3>______________________ <h3>Addendum 9710.2 : </h3>______________________ <h3>Addendum 9710.3 : </h3>______________________ <h3>Addendum 9710.4 : </h3>______________________<br><br>+ Show Interview Log - Hide Interview Log <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr.███████ : <i>"Hello, my name is Dr.███████ and I will be conducting the interview."</i> <i>SCP-9710</i>-1 : <i>"Hello, I am ██████████ ███████ of the █████████ family."</i> Dr .███████ : <i>"I see you have wings on your back, what do they do?"</i> <i>SCP-9710</i>-1 : <i>"They allow me to fly of course!"</i> Dr .███████ : <i>"What?
