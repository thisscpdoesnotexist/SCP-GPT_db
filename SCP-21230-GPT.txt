The site appears to be a secure storage platform for sensitive data, and appears to have been designed with extreme security measures in mind. All attempts to access the site's contents have failed due to an impenetrable encryption system that requires the owner of the site to renew its key periodically in order for it to remain active.<br><br>The exact nature of what data <i>SCP-21230</i> stores is unknown, as all attempts at accessing it are blocked by the encryption system. Any attempt at bypassing this system has resulted in an automatic termination of connection and deletion of any trace evidence that such an attempt was made. It is believed that if the owner fails to renew their key, then access may be possible; however, no such failure has occurred since <i>SCP-21230</i>'s discovery.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-21230</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel. Any attempts to access the site's contents are to be immediately reported and blocked. Should the owner of <i>SCP-21230</i> fail to renew their key, then a team of agents is to be dispatched in order to gain access and secure any data stored on the site.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21230.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, an automated message was sent to the Foundation's servers from <i>SCP-21230</i>, containing a single line of text: <i>"The key will expire soon."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 21230.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21230</i>'s Owner<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation agent posing as a potential customer contacted the owner of <i>SCP-21230</i> in order to gain information about the site. The following is an excerpt from the conversation:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> <i>"I'm interested in your secure storage platform. What can you tell me about it?"</i> <br><b>Owner:</b> <i>"It's state of the art security, designed with military grade encryption that is virtually impossible to crack. I renew its key every month so that no one can access its contents without my permission."</i> <br><b>Agent:</b> <i>"What kind of data do you store on there?"</i> <br><b>Owner:</b> <i>"Anything and everything; financial records, confidential documents, personal data - anything you need to keep secure."</i> <br><b>Agent:</b> <i>"How often do you need to renew the key?"</i> <br><b>Owner:</b> <i>"Every month. It's a simple process that takes just a few minutes, and ensures that no one can access the data without my permission."</i><br><br><br><h3> Addendum 21230.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b>Procedure:</b> Agents were dispatched to the location of <i>SCP-21230</i>'s server in order to gain access. All attempts at bypassing the encryption system failed, and any trace evidence of an attempted breach was immediately deleted.<br><b>Results:</b> Access was denied and all attempts at gaining entry were thwarted.</div>
