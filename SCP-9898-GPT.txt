Civilians attempting to enter the area are to be turned away and administered Class B amnestics if necessary .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9898</i> is a sentient presence whose awareness and intelligence increases proportionally to the number of people within 6.2 kilometers. <i>SCP-9898</i> will attempt to influence those within its range into committing acts of violence and destruction, with a particular focus on causing mass casualties through vehicular collisions or suicide bombings.<br><br><i>SCP-9898</i> has demonstrated an ability to cause individuals to perceive it as a loved one or trusted friend, in order to coerce them into committing acts of violence against others. <i>SCP-9898</i> can also manipulate electronic devices in order to communicate with subjects who are not currently present at the location where it manifests, including through text messages and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter .<br><br><i>SCP-9898</i> was first discovered during an investigation into the disappearance of several members of the ████████ family from ████████████, England on 20/4/20██. The family's bodies were found at their home address following reports that they had been involved in several hit-and run incidents over a period of three days leading up to their disappearance; these incidents were initially believed by local authorities to be accidents but later determined by Foundation investigators to have been caused by <i>SCP-98</i> 98's influence . A Foundation containment team was dispatched following reports that two children had disappeared from their homes under similar circumstances; these children were found alive but severely injured at SCP 98 98's current location , which was then secured by MTF Epsilon -10 (<i>"Pony Express"</i>). All civilians within 6.2 kilometers were administered Class B amnestics before being released from quarantine . The area has since been fenced off for public safety purposes pending further investigation .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9898.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9898</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted via text message using the Facebook account of one of <i>SCP-9898</i>'s victims, who had been killed in a hit and run incident several days prior to the interview . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello? Are you there? <i>SCP-98</i> 98: Yeah, I'm here. <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>What is your name?

It was so scary! I heard my mom screaming; then everything went black…<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Who was driving the van that hit your family ?<br><br><i>SCP-9</i> 8 9 8: No idea, hon .

The following is an excerpt from the transcript of this experiment .<br><br>SCP -9 8 9 8: What's up, loser? D <br><br><b>-class: </b>I'm sorry… I didn't mean to hurt you… SCP -9 8 9 8: You don't have to be sorry, sweetie. It's not your fault that you're so stupid . D <br><br><b>-class: </b>But I want to be better! Please tell me what I can do! SCP- 9 8 9 8: You could start by killing yourself. That would make me really happy !<br><br>D -class proceeds to climb over the fence surrounding <i>SCP-9898</i>'s location and stand in front of oncoming traffic before being restrained by security personnel. Subject was later terminated for breach of containment protocols . Experiment 98 98 -2: A remote controlled drone equipped with a video camera was sent into the area surrounding SCP 98 98's location; footage recorded during this experiment is attached below . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> 0 min 30 secs – Subject enters area containing <i>SCP-9898</i>; no response observed from object at this time. 1 min 15 secs – Drone loses signal due to obstruction caused by trees in nearby forest; signal returns after several seconds with no change in subject or object behavior. 1 min 45 secs – Vehicle approaches from distance and collides with subject, causing severe damage; vehicle continues travelling past subject without stopping or slowing down until it reaches the opposite end of road where it crashes into a tree and explodes . 2 mins 20 secs – Several more vehicles collide with one another at various points along road before reaching opposite end where they crash into same tree as previous vehicle ; all vehicles involved are destroyed upon impact except for one which drives away without stopping or slowing down until reaching its destination , causing several casualties along its route before crashing into a building at its final destination which collapses under impact, killing all occupants inside including driver who sustains fatal injuries upon impact but does not appear to suffer any further harm despite remaining conscious throughout entire ordeal ; driver exits vehicle shortly afterwards and walks away unharmed while ignoring injured civilians nearby who are pleading for help . 4 mins 10 secs – Security team arrives on scene via helicopter ; team members exit helicopter carrying assault rifles but do not fire them when confronted by armed men wearing masks who emerge from nearby woodland carrying assault rifles themselves (see Addendum 9899). Security team retreats back inside helicopter while masked men stand guard around perimeter of road leading up towards forested area containing <i>SCP-988</i> 0 ' s location (see Footage Log). 4 mins 55sec s – Security team exits helicopter again after masked men disappear back into woodland; team members carry unconscious civilian out from under wreckage caused by previous collisions then return him inside craft while other civilians flee in panic as helicopters rotors cause debris around them flying through air (see Footage Log). 5mins 35sec s – Helicopter takes off again after all personnel have boarded craft then flies off towards horizon ; security detail remains outside until craft disappears completely over horizon before returning inside building where they remain waiting until conclusion of test period , when they are debriefed about their experience (see Debriefing Transcript). 6mins 40sec s– Subject reemerges from forest near point where collision occurred earlier , appearing uninjured despite having sustained severe injuries during earlier collision ( see Footage Log) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears that if an individual survives an encounter with either entity present within Area ██ then they will become impervious to harm inflicted upon them by any other person or object moving within 6.2 kilometers of their current position regardless as whether said individual has previously been exposed directly or indirectly through observation alone. This effect appears limited only those individuals whose actions were influenced directly by either entity prior to exposure , however there may be additional factors involved which require further investigation</div>
