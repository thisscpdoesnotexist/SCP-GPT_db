<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17667 is  a set of nails. Anything the nail is hammered into becomes indestructible. However, this also makes removing the nail to use elsewhere impossible.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17667<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17667</i> is a set of nails composed of an unknown metal alloy. When any nail from the set is hammered into any material, the object will become indestructible and unable to be removed from its surface.<br><br>The nails are approximately 2 cm in length and have a pointed head. The head of each nail has been etched with a unique symbol, which appears to be non-anomalous in nature.<br><br>Testing has revealed that <i>SCP-17667</i>'s anomalous properties do not extend beyond the physical structure it was hammered into; objects placed within or around the affected area remain unaffected by <i>SCP-17667</i>'s anomalous properties. Additionally, no anomalies have been observed when attempting to hammer another nail from <i>SCP-17667</i> into an already affected object.<br><br>The origin and purpose of <i>SCP-17667</i> are currently unknown, as well as how it came to Foundation custody.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17667</i> is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17667</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any testing involving <i>SCP-17667</i> must be authorized by the Site Director and supervised by at least two (2) personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. All test subjects are to be monitored for any signs of anomalous activity before, during, and after testing. Any affected objects are to be contained until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17667.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a series of tests were conducted to determine the limits of <i>SCP-17667</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> A nail from <i>SCP-17667</i> was hammered into a block of wood. The wood became indestructible and unable to be removed from the surface.<br><b><br>Test 2:</b> A nail from <i>SCP-17667</i> was hammered into a steel wall. The wall became indestructible and unable to be removed from the surface.<br><b><br>Test 3:</b> A nail from <i>SCP-17667</i> was hammered into a human subject (D-5678). D-5678 did not display any signs of anomalous activity and was able to move freely after being nailed in place.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17667.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. █████<br><br>Dr. █████ was interviewed in regards to <i>SCP-17667</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. █████, can you explain what you believe to be the purpose of <i>SCP-17667</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. █████:</b> I believe that <i>SCP-17667</i> was created as a means of permanently securing an object in place. It could be used for anything from protecting valuables to keeping prisoners contained in a specific area. The indestructible nature of the objects it is hammered into make it nearly impossible to remove or tamper with, which makes it ideal for these types of applications.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17667.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test #:</b> 17667-1<br><b><br>Subject:</b> A standard wooden block.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> One nail from <i>SCP-17667</i> was hammered into the wooden block.<br><b><br>Results:</b> The nail became embedded in the wood, and the object became indestructible. Attempts to remove the nail were unsuccessful; attempts to hammer another nail into the same object also failed.</div>
