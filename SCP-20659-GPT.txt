They harshly enforce the laws of physics and punish those who don't comply.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-20659<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-20659</i> is a group of cosmic entities, collectively referred to as the <i>"Cosmic Police"</i>, that exist beyond human comprehension. They are typically perceived as police officers, wearing uniforms and carrying weapons.<br><br><i>SCP-20659</i>'s primary purpose is to enforce the laws of physics and punish those who violate them. This can range from small infractions such as breaking the speed of light or creating perpetual motion machines, to larger violations such as attempting to alter reality itself or create objects that defy physical laws.<br><br>When <i>SCP-20659</i> detects an infraction, they will appear in their uniformed forms and attempt to apprehend those responsible for it. If unsuccessful, they will resort to more extreme measures such as using powerful energy blasts or manipulating matter on a subatomic level in order to neutralize the threat. Those who are apprehended by <i>SCP-20659</i> are usually never seen again, although there have been rare reports of individuals being released after being subjected to some form of punishment by <i>SCP-20659</i>.<br><br>In addition, <i>SCP-20659</i> has been known to intervene in cases where physical laws may be violated unintentionally or without malicious intent; however they have shown leniency towards those who demonstrate remorse and understanding for their actions.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-20659</i>, containment is impossible. However, Foundation personnel are to monitor all known cases of physical law violations and report any sightings of <i>SCP-20659</i> to the nearest Site Director.<br><br>In addition, Foundation personnel are encouraged to spread awareness about the existence and purpose of <i>SCP-20659</i> in order to discourage individuals from attempting any form of physical law violation.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20659.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, Foundation personnel witnessed <i>SCP-20659</i> apprehending an individual attempting to create a perpetual motion machine. After the individual was taken away, <i>SCP-20659</i> left without a word.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20659.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-20659</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a Foundation agent was able to make contact with <i>SCP-20659</i> in order to gain insight into their purpose and methods. The following is an excerpt from the interview:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> What is your purpose? Why do you enforce the laws of physics?<br><b><br><i>SCP-20659</i>:</b> We are here to ensure that reality remains stable and orderly. It is our duty to protect it from those who would seek to disrupt its balance or use its power for their own selfish ends. We will not hesitate to punish those who attempt such violations, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem.<br><br><h3> Addendum 20659.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, an experiment was conducted to test <i>SCP-20659</i>'s response to physical law violations. A small group of researchers were instructed to attempt to construct a perpetual motion machine in a sealed room. After several hours of work, the machine was completed and activated.<br><br>Within seconds, <i>SCP-20659</i> appeared in the room and demanded that the researchers cease their activities immediately. When they refused, <i>SCP-20659</i> began using powerful energy blasts to disable the machine and apprehend those responsible for its construction. All personnel involved were taken into custody by <i>SCP-20659</i> and have not been seen since.</div>
