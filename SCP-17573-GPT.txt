The program was designed to create a super soldier, specifically a catgirl, through the use of genetic engineering and cybernetic enhancements.<br><br>The project appears to have been abandoned in the late 1980s due to lack of resources and political instability. However, it is believed that some test subjects may have escaped containment before the project's cancellation.<br><br><i>SCP-17573</i> instances are humanoid felines with enhanced physical capabilities such as strength and speed far beyond those of normal humans. They possess heightened senses including night vision, acute hearing, and smell as well as razor sharp claws which can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. In addition they possess advanced combat training in various martial arts styles making them formidable opponents in close quarters combat situations.<br><br>Instances also possess advanced intelligence with some being able to speak multiple languages fluently while others demonstrate problem solving skills on par with that of a human adult. It should be noted however that instances display no signs of sapience or empathy towards other living creatures making them dangerous if left unchecked or unsupervised by personnel trained in dealing with SCP objects or entities possessing anomalous abilities/properties (e.g., MTF).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-17573</i>, containment is difficult and requires constant monitoring. All known instances are to be contained in individual cells within Site-███ with no contact with other personnel or objects outside their cell. Personnel assigned to monitor <i>SCP-17573</i> must be trained in dealing with anomalous entities possessing enhanced physical capabilities and combat training.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of the anomaly, all sightings of <i>SCP-17573</i> instances must be reported immediately and any potential test subjects should be apprehended and brought into containment for study. Any attempts at communication or interaction with an instance should only be done under direct supervision by a Level 4 personnel or higher.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17573.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of <i>SCP-17573</i> instances was encountered in the city of █████████. The instances were engaged by MTF personnel and subdued before being brought into containment. Following interrogation and analysis, it was determined that the group had escaped from a Soviet research facility located in the Ural Mountains sometime in the late 1980s.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17573.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17573</i>-1<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-17573</i>-1<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Good evening, <i>SCP-17573</i>-1. Can you tell me about the project that created you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17573</i>-1:</b> It was a secret program designed to create super soldiers for the Soviet Union. They wanted to create a catgirl with enhanced physical capabilities and combat training so she could be used as an effective tool in battle.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17573.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment Log 17573.3 was conducted on ██/██/20██ in order to determine the capabilities of <i>SCP-17573</i> instances and evaluate their combat potential.<br><b><br>Subjects:</b> Two (2) <i>SCP-17573</i> instances, designated as Alpha and Beta.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> The two subjects were placed in a simulated urban environment and instructed to engage each other in hand-to-hand combat using only their natural abilities. The fight was monitored by personnel from a safe distance using video cameras mounted throughout the area.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Alpha emerged victorious after a lengthy battle that lasted approximately thirty minutes. Beta displayed superior strength, speed, and agility but ultimately succumbed to Alpha's superior technique and skillful use of her claws. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported during this experiment however minor cuts and bruises were observed on both combatants when they ceased fighting.</div>
