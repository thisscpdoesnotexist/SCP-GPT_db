When <i>SCP-15455</i> performs these actions, subjects who observe it will believe that they have seen an ordinary person doing those things instead of an anomalous entity performing them.<br><br><i>SCP-15455</i> was discovered after reports of <i>"a ghost"</i> were filed by citizens of █████████, ██████ who had witnessed it performing its anomalous effects on other people nearby and believed it was a real person instead of an anomaly due to their own ignorance about the existence of paranormal phenomena and/or their lack of understanding about how anomalies can be distinguished from nonanomalous entities (see Addendum 15455-1). It should be noted that this effect does not occur when directly viewing <i>SCP-15455</i> through electronic devices with cameras (such as smartphones or video cameras), nor does this effect occur when viewing photographs or videos taken via such devices; however, if one views such images later on another device without any camera present in them (such as computers), they may believe that they are seeing a real person despite being aware at the time they viewed them that there were no real people physically present in those images at any point during their creation process. This suggests some form of memetic influence may be involved with this effect; however, further research is required before anything definitive can be said about its nature and origin.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15455.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-15455</i> was discovered after reports of <i>"a ghost"</i> were filed by citizens of █████████, ██████ who had witnessed it performing its anomalous effects on other people nearby and believed it was a real person instead of an anomaly due to their own ignorance about the existence of paranormal phenomena and/or their lack of understanding about how anomalies can be distinguished from nonanomalous entities.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15455.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>The following interview was conducted with <i>SCP-15455</i> via a text chat program.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15455.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15455-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15455, a 38-year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to walk down the street while wearing a camera on his chest. <i>SCP-15455</i> was then instructed to walk down the same street in order to test whether or not it could be recorded by cameras. An agent was present nearby to observe the experiment and make sure that no civilians were present at any point during the experiment.<br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected, when viewed later on another device without any camera present in them (such as computers), D-15455 appeared normal; however, when viewed on devices with cameras attached (such as smartphones or video cameras), he appeared anomalous despite being aware at all times that there were no real people physically present in those images at any point during their creation process.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>This suggests some form of memetic influence may be involved with this effect; however, further research is required before anything definitive can be said about its nature and origin.</div>
