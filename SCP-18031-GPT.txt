It will then proceed to bite down and consume the target’s flesh until it has been satisfied or until the target has been completely consumed.<br><br><i>SCP-18031</i> is highly intelligent and can understand basic commands given by personnel wearing protective gear. It has also displayed an affinity for human blood, which it prefers over other sources of sustenance. It is unknown what motivates <i>SCP-18031</i>’s behavior; however, researchers theorize that it may be driven by hunger or some form of instinctual drive.<br><br>It should be noted that while <i>SCP-18031</i> appears harmless when not provoked, it can become extremely aggressive when hungry or threatened in any way; caution should be taken when dealing with this anomaly as even minor injuries have resulted in severe injury or death for those involved due to its powerful bite force and quick reflexes.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18031</i> is to be contained in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with a reinforced glass window, allowing personnel to observe the anomaly without risking injury.<br><br>The chamber should also contain several sources of food, such as raw meat and vegetables, which are to be replaced regularly. In addition, the chamber should contain several toys and other objects that <i>SCP-18031</i> can interact with in order to keep it occupied while not actively pursuing its prey.<br><br>Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to enter the containment chamber without proper protective gear; any attempts to do so will result in immediate disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18031.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-18031</i> was observed to be in possession of a small metal object resembling a key. Analysis of the object revealed that it is composed of an unknown alloy and appears to have no special properties or functions. It is unknown how <i>SCP-18031</i> acquired this object or what purpose it serves.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18031.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18031</i><br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-18031</i><br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> Interview was conducted to gain insight into the motivations of <i>SCP-18031</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18031</i>.
