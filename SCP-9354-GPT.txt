The cave had been modified to have a small computer room, which contained <i>SCP-9354</i> . The cave is believed to have been used by an organization called <i>"The Foundation"</i> for some time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9354.1 :</h3> Interview<br><br>The following interview was conducted with <i>SCP-9354</i>.<br><br>+<br> Show Interview - Hide Interview Interviewed: <i>SCP-9354</i><br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. ████<br><br><br>Foreword: This is the first interview with <i>SCP-9354</i> since its recovery, and is used to determine the capabilities of it . <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ████: Hello, I'm here to conduct an interview with you. Can you hear me?<br><br><br><i>SCP-9354</i>: Yes, I can hear you fine .<br><br>Dr.<br> ████: Good, now let's get started on these questions then shall we? First question is what do you know about what happened in this cave that we found you in?<br><br><i>SCP-9354</i> remains silent for several seconds before answering .<br><br><br><i>SCP-9354</i>: They called us The Foundation, and said they were going to <i>"better humanity"</i> through their <i>"Foundation"</i>. We were told that when people died a machine would catch them and transfer them into a computer . The data from this computer would be stored in a database after being sorted through by several programs . And once enough data was collected it would be given to more advanced AI so it could generate better plans for technology than any human could make on their own . To make sure no bad data got into the database there was one person whose job it was to check if anyone had cheated on any of the tests they had put us through or tried stealing some of our data which we supposedly had copied onto disks hidden all over our base unseen by anyone but ourselves (which never existed) According to them our success depended solely on how much information they were able to collect via our methods of testing things out before putting them into widespread use or storage until such time as said methods could be improved upon or replaced altogether so as not interfere with our mission which apparently entailed sorting through various pieces of information such as personal journals , emails , notes , recordings etcetera/etcetera/etcetera/ etcetera until hopefully something useful came up after which a plan involving whatever that useful thing was generated by said AI program(s) Then if this plan worked out then those involved in making said program(s) would start working on improving upon its design using what ever new knowledge they gained from its creation along with old previous designs for other projects like ours alongside random bits of information just lying around until finally something either not made by us or worked better than anything made by us resulted from all these efforts Which if successful according to them proved that at least one idea someone mentioned somewhere else hadn't been used yet If however no suitable idea came up within a reasonable amount time then everything went back down the drain again although usually only temporarily because unless one person claimed something another already did nobody else knew about most ideas anyway because nobody ever talked about anything except things pertaining directly or indirectly toward their job Even when off duty everyone kept quiet because there wasn't really much else outside<br><br><h3>Addendum 9354.2 :</h3> Incident 9354-1<br><br><br>The following is a message left by <i>SCP-9354</i>:</div>
