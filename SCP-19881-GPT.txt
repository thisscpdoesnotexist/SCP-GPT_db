<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19881 is  a McDonald's ice cream machine that actually works properly</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19881<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19881</i> is a standard McDonald's ice cream machine, with the exception that it produces an infinite amount of ice cream. The type of ice cream produced by <i>SCP-19881</i> changes depending on the user's desires, and can range from classic flavors such as chocolate and vanilla to more obscure flavors.<br><br>The machine has been observed to produce large quantities of ice cream in a short period of time, far exceeding what would be expected from a normal machine. The rate at which this occurs increases when multiple people are present near the machine.<br><br><i>SCP-19881</i> does not appear to require any power source or maintenance; however, its anomalous properties will cease if it is removed from its current location (a McDonald’s restaurant in [REDACTED], USA).<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-19881</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Access to the machine is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.<br><br>Any ice cream produced by <i>SCP-19881</i> must be disposed of immediately, as it has been observed to have anomalous properties that may cause adverse effects if consumed. Any personnel found consuming the ice cream are to be reprimanded and given amnestics.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19881.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of personnel attempted to consume the ice cream produced by <i>SCP-19881</i>. All personnel reported feeling an extreme sense of euphoria and a desire to continue consuming the ice cream. After several minutes, they began experiencing severe hallucinations and physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The effects subsided after approximately one hour.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19881.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19881</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel at Site-██ conducted an interview with <i>SCP-19881</i>. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us why you produce so much ice cream?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19881</i>:</b> I don't know. I just do what I'm supposed to do.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know why the ice cream has anomalous properties?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19881</i>:</b> No, I don't. I just make it and people eat it.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you have any other information that might be useful?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19881</i>:</b> No, I'm sorry. That's all I know.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19881.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log:</b><br>Subjects were instructed to approach <i>SCP-19881</i> and request a specific type of ice cream. The machine was observed to produce the requested flavor within seconds, regardless of how obscure or complex the request was.<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> Subject requested <i>"a scoop of strawberry cheesecake ice cream"</i>. Result: Ice cream produced as requested. No anomalous effects noted. <br><b>Test 2:</b> Subjects requested <i>"a scoop of blueberry pie ice cream"</i>. Result: Ice cream produced as requested. No anomalous effects noted. <br><b>Test 3:</b> Subject requested <i>"a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream with rainbow sprinkles"</i>. Result: Ice cream produced as requested, along with an additional topping not specified by the subject (rainbow sprinkles). No anomalous effects noted.</div>
