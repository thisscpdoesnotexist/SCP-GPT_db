Then someone else pointed out that there's only one place in Wales where there are any castles left and its right near where we found this place so pretty much everyone agreed that we should go back there because why not? And now here I am talking with you guys about how awesome this is haha! So yeah thats pretty much everything sorry if i rambled on a bit but i get excited sometimes! Dr.: Thank you very much for your time Mr., If anything else comes up do not hesitate to contact us immediately! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears as though <i>SCP-10357</i> has been contained successfully without issue due to its location being unknown by most civilians..<br><br><h3>Addendum 10357.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10357-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>A group of ██ rats.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The rats were placed in <i>SCP-10357</i> for 24 hours.
