All objects affected by <i>SCP-25471</i> will experience a force similar to gravity, but instead of being attracted to masses, they are attracted to other objects based on their physical appearance. This force is not limited to organic lifeforms; inanimate objects such as rocks and machines can also be affected by it.<br><br>The strength of this force varies depending on the attractiveness of the object, with more attractive objects having a stronger pull than less attractive ones. It has been observed that some individuals can resist its effects, while others cannot; however, no pattern has been found between those who can resist it and those who cannot.<br><br>In addition to this phenomenon’s effects on physical attraction, it has also been observed that certain emotions experienced by individuals are enhanced when exposed to <i>SCP-25471</i>’s influence; these include feelings of love or admiration for an individual or object affected by its influence. The intensity of these emotions increases exponentially with proximity to the source object or individual until reaching an apex at approximately 10 meters away from them before fading away completely after leaving their vicinity.<br><br>As <i>SCP-25471</i> affects all living beings indiscriminately regardless of species or gender identity, containment protocols have been established in order to mitigate any potential risks posed by this anomaly’s existence: <br>1) A perimeter must be established around any area where instances of <i>SCP-25471</i> have occurred in order restrict access and prevent further exposure/spread; <br>2) Any personnel entering said area must wear protective gear designed specifically for shielding against its anomalous properties; <br>3) All personnel assigned within the perimeter must undergo psychological evaluation prior and post assignment for signs/symptoms related directly or indirectly towards emotional manipulation caused by exposure; <br>4) All attempts at studying SCPs anomalous properties should be conducted remotely using robotic probes equipped with appropriate shielding equipment if necessary<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-25471</i>, it is impossible to contain or control its effects. As such, containment efforts are focused on preventing further spread and limiting exposure.<br><br>All personnel assigned within the perimeter must be monitored for signs/symptoms related directly or indirectly towards emotional manipulation caused by exposure. Any personnel exhibiting these symptoms should be immediately removed from their post and given appropriate psychological treatment.<br><br>In addition, all attempts at studying <i>SCP-25471</i>’s anomalous properties should be conducted remotely using robotic probes equipped with appropriate shielding equipment if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25471.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an instance of <i>SCP-25471</i> occurred in a residential area, resulting in the displacement of several individuals due to its effects. All affected individuals were evacuated and treated for psychological trauma related to their experience.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25471.2: </h3> Interview with D-25471-1<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> D-25471-1 (subject exposed to <i>SCP-25471</i>) <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████████ <br>&ltBegin Log&gt <br><b>Dr. ██████████:</b> Please state your name and age for the record. <br><b>D-25471-1:</b> My name is [REDACTED], I'm twenty four years old. <br><b>Dr. ██████████:</b> Alright, thank you [REDACTED]. Can you tell me what happened when you were exposed to SCP 25471? <br><b>D-25471-1:</b> Well, it was strange… I felt like there was a force pulling me towards certain people or objects in the room, and it seemed to be based on how attractive they were. I couldn't really explain it, but it was like a magnetic attraction that I couldn't control. <br><b>Dr. ██████████:</b> Interesting… Was there anything else you experienced while under the influence of <i>SCP-25471</i>? <br><b>D-25471-1:</b> Yes, when I was close to certain people or objects, I felt this overwhelming feeling of love or admiration for them that seemed to increase in intensity the closer I got. It was almost like my emotions were being manipulated by something outside of myself. <br><b>Dr. ██████████:</b> Thank you [REDACTED], that will be all for now. <br>&ltEnd Log&gt <br><b>Closing Statement:</b> D-25471-1 was administered Class A amnestics and released from containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25471.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 25471.3A:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-17892, a female human subject with no prior knowledge of <i>SCP-25471</i>’s anomalous properties.<br><b>Objective:</b> To observe the effects of <i>SCP-25471</i> on an individual with no prior knowledge or experience of its effects. <br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was placed in a room and instructed to remain still for 10 minutes while exposed to <i>SCP-25471</i>’s influence. <br><b>Results:</b> After 10 minutes, subject reported feeling “drawn towards something in the corner of the room” and began moving towards it slowly before being stopped by researchers. Upon further inspection, it was discovered that the object she had been drawn towards was an attractive male mannequin located in the corner of the room.</div>
