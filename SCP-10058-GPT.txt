I am here to ask you some questions about the cartoon character you created. █████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>Sure thing. Ask away! Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Thank you for your time, Mr. [REDACTED]. Now, can you tell me where did the idea for this character come from? █████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>You know how it is with these cartoons; they just pop into my head out of nowhere! It's like I'm watching a movie or something and then suddenly I have this idea on my mind that would make a great cartoon character! It's amazing how creative the human mind can be sometimes! Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>So… what happened next? 【REDACTED】 【REDACTED】 Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>That's quite interesting actually… so what do we have here? A rabbit with superpowers who lives in a hole under a tree and eats carrots all day long? And he has his own show now too? How did that happen exactly? Did someone approach you or something like that? Or was it your idea to pitch it as an animated series to some network executives maybe? What was their reaction when they heard about this new cartoon series concept of yours anyway?! Tell me all about it please! And don't leave anything out either because every detail could be important for us in understanding this anomaly better so please try not to skip anything even if it seems unimportant or irrelevant at first sight alright?! Alright then… go on… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing everything he had to say about <i>SCP-10058</i> , I decided not to interview him anymore because he seemed very tired after talking for so long and also because I think we got enough information from him already anyway .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10058.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>10058-1: </b>One (1) D-Class personnel was placed in a room with <i>SCP-10058</i> and instructed to converse with it.
