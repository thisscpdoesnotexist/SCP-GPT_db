Are you a dog? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>No, I am not a dog but can we get back to the interview please? Alright then…<i>SCP-15353</i> do you know where you are right now? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15353</i>: </b>This is a containment cell right? Why am I in here again? Is it because of that thing that happened at Site 17 last month or was it because of what happened at Site 19 two months ago or was it because of what happened at [DATA EXPUNGED] three weeks ago or was it all those things combined into one big thing that makes me super dangerous to everyone around me and why am I in this room again?! <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>That's enough! We don't need any more information about your past behavior than we already have! Now if you would just answer my questions…yes this is a containment cell and yes we believe that you could be dangerous to everyone around here so please try to stay calm while answering my questions alright?! (<i>SCP-15353</i> calms down) Thank You…now then can you tell me why people think that they should love dogs so much more than any other animal on our planet Earth? (<i>SCP-15353</i> looks confused) Excuse me but did anyone ever tell you how stupid humans are when they're born into this world without the ability to think for themselves without some kind of outside influence telling them what they should do with their lives every step along the way from birth till death!? (Dr.) Please try not to interrupt me while I'm asking rhetorical questions okay!? It really pisses off whoever's interviewing me and trust me when I say <i>"I don't want anyone pissed off when they're interviewing someone like myself."</i> So anyways back on track as far as your question goes about humans loving dogs more than anything else on earth well let's just say that most people have never been exposed to anything else besides dogs in their entire lives which doesn't help matters even further since most people end up marrying someone who loves dogs just like them which makes them feel even better about loving dogs since there are others out there who love something similar too which helps reinforce their belief system in regards too loving things related too dogs such as other human beings who also love things related too dogs such as each other and themselves which only furthers their belief system even stronger until eventually all those people start having children together creating more human beings with an even greater belief system towards loving things related too dog such as other human beings who also love things related too dog such as each other and themselves etcetera etcetera ad nauseum until eventually everyone becomes nothing but walking talking piles of shit filled with nothing but pure unconditional fucking stupidity towards everything within existence itself including themselves including everything else within existence itself including everything else within existence itself including themselves etcetera ad infinitum ad nauseum until finally no one knows anymore if they were ever alive before being born into existence nor do they care nor does anyone give a fuck anyways since no one cares anymore about anything anymore especially not caring if anyone cares or not especially caring if no one cares or not especially giving a fuck whether no one gives a fuck whether anyone gives a fuck whether giving fucks whether giving fucks whether being given fucks by others gives others fucks given by others give others fucks given by others give others funks given by those whom receive said fucks from said givers givers receiving said fucked from said fucked persons receiving said fucked from said givers receiving said fucked from givers having received previously received previously received previously received previously recieved previously recieved previously recieved earlier recieved earlier recieved earlier reecived earlier reecived earlier reecived ealier reecived ealier reecived ealier receeived ealier receeived ealier receeived eariler receeive eariler receeive eariler rceioved eariler rceioved earirl ercieivd ercieiv<br><br><h3>Addendum 15353.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15353-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-15353</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-15353</i> is to be exposed to a dog.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After the dog entered the containment cell, <i>SCP-15353</i> began to bark at it.

Experiment 15353-2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9341 (Male, 30 years old)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9341 is to enter the containment cell of <i>SCP-15353</i> with a bag of dog food and attempt feeding it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After entering the containment cell, D-9341 opened up the bag of dog food and attempted feeding it to <i>SCP-15353</i> . However, after an hour of attempting this, D9341 was unable to get any food into its mouth as every time he got close enough for it eat something he would pull away from him and begin barking at him. After about 2 hours of this happening, D9341 became frustrated and left the room without finishing his task (D9341 later complained that <i>"that damn thing wouldn't stop barking!"</i>). The following day Dr ████████ decided that they should try again with someone else in charge who might have more patience than Agent ████ did yesterday. A new agent was assigned by Dr ████████ who had never seen or heard about what happened yesterday so they were unaware that there had been any issues during previous attempts at giving feedings before entering the room today where they were told by Dr ████████ that their task was simply just giving feedings which they proceeded with without hesitation even though when he entered his face looked slightly nervous but he still went through with it anyway despite having no prior experience in dealing with animals before today but nevertheless still managed fine regardless as expected although throughout most if not all of this time whenever Agent █████████ tried getting closer towards its mouth for feeding purposes whenever he got close enough for feeding purposes instead however when trying doing so instead however when trying doing so however whenever trying doing so instead however whenever trying doing so instead however whenever trying doing so instead however whenever trying doing so instead however whenever attempting this process each time like clockwork each time like clockwork each time like clockwork each time like clockwork each time like clockwork while also being careful not too let himself get too close where its teeth could reach him or make contact due too possible risks involved including possible injuries caused by bites inflicted on target/subject's body part(s) resulting in possible blood loss leading too death if severe enough along with other things such as infections etcetera which could easily occur if bitten especially since said subject seems very aggressive towards anyone coming near its mouth while also being careful not too let himself get too close where its teeth could reach him or make contact due too possible risks involved including possible injuries caused by bites inflicted on target/subject's body part(s) resulting in possible blood loss leading too death if severe enough along with other things such as infections etcetera which could easily occur if bitten especially since said subject seems very aggressive towards anyone coming near its mouth while also being careful not too let himself get too close where its teeth could reach him or make contact due too possible risks involved including possible injuries caused by bites inflicted on target/subject's body part(s) resulting in possible blood loss leading too death if severe enough along with other things such as infections etcetera which could easily occur if bitten especially since said subject seems very aggressive towards anyone coming near its mouth while also being careful not h… … … … … … … ..…</div>
