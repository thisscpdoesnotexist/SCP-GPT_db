One (1) D-Class personnel who has been trained in sign language for use with nonverbal subjects (D-XXXX). D-XXXX is also deaf in both ears due to an accident when he was younger which caused him permanent hearing damage in both ears . The deafness occurred on his left side first and spread over time until he became completely deaf on his right side as well as his left side . He can still hear low frequency sounds such as bass tones from musical instruments or human voices at close range . Due to this fact , he can still communicate through sign language without any issues even though he cannot hear anything being said by anyone else while doing so . He is fluent in American Sign Language , but has knowledge of other forms of sign language as well due to his education before becoming a Foundation employee . He is considered proficient at using ASL for communication purposes , but not enough so where he could be considered an expert or master at using ASL for any reason outside of communication purposes while working with nonverbal subjects such as SCPs or other anomalous entities that are capable of communicating through sign language only due to their inability or unwillingness to speak verbally under normal circumstances like most human beings would do normally without any issues whatsoever even if they were able because they were capable of doing so despite having no physical impairments preventing them from being able speak verbally like most people do normally without any issues whatsoever regardless due their lack of ability speak verbally under normal circumstances like most people would do normally without any issues whatsoever even if they were capable speaking verbally because they had no physical impairments preventing them from speaking verbally under normal circumstances like most people would otherwise do naturally without issue regardless because they're physically unable speak verbally under normal circumstances like everyone else does naturally instead regardless because they're physically unable talk just like everyone else does naturally instead regardless because their speech impediments prevent them talking normally just like everyone else does naturally instead regardless because their speech impediments prevent them talking normally just like everyone else does naturally instead regardless…<br><br><b>Note: </b>Subject became increasingly agitated during experiment log entry above after repeating himself several times before stopping abruptly after approximately another minute had passed since beginning experiment log entry above before stating <i>"I'm sorry, I'll stop now."</i> Subject later apologized for acting out during experiment log entry above after testing concluded successfully afterwards .<br><br></div>
