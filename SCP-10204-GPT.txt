It was found in 2014 by the Foundation after it had been mentioned on a popular internet forum.<br><br><i>SCP-10204</i> has no limits on how much data can be stored and how many servers can be created within its network. It even allows for the creation of virtual machines, which are also unlimited in number and size. <i>SCP-10204</i>'s terms of service state that it will not take down any data or servers unless they violate local laws or their Terms of Service (which are not known to anyone outside of <i>SCP-10204</i>). If a server is shut down by another user, all files that were uploaded to it remain intact as long as they do not violate local laws or the Terms of Service (see Addendum 10204-1).<br><br><i>SCP-10204</i>'s main weakness is that it does not allow access to any information regarding its owner(s) or its location; this makes tracking them impossible. Any attempts made so far have failed due to <i>SCP-10204</i> being hosted in an unknown location with an unknown amount of servers spread out over multiple datacenters around the world. The only way for users to contact <i>SCP-10204</i> seems to be through its support ticket system, but no replies have ever been received from support agents despite numerous attempts made by various users over several years now. Attempts at contacting other companies owned by the same entity (if any) have also failed, leading researchers to believe that there might only be one company behind all instances of <i>SCP-10</i> 204 .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10204.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????<br><br>+ Show Interview Log 10204-1 - Hide Interview Log 10204-1 <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>??????? (Founder of <i>SCP-10204</i>)<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ (Foundation Liaison to <i>SCP-10204</i>) <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ after he had managed to contact ??????? on the support ticket system of <i>SCP-10</i> 204 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello? Are you there? ??????? is typing… ???????: Yes, I am here. Who are you and why did you contact me? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>My name is Doctor ███ and I'm a representative of the Foundation, an organization that works with anomalies such as yours in order to protect normalcy from them. We have been looking into your company for some time now and we would like to get in contact with you for further cooperation regarding your anomaly's nature and how it works exactly; we also want to know more about its location and who owns it so that we can be sure that no one will ever find out about its existence or use it for malicious purposes against normal people or our organization itself, which would be very bad for everyone involved if this were ever to happen, especially since there are no limits on what kind of data can be stored within your network nor how many servers can be created within it; this could prove dangerous if someone were able to hack into your servers or gain access through other means, but luckily no one has been able to do so yet due to the fact that they cannot track down any information regarding their location nor yours either since they are hosted in an unknown location with an unknown amount of servers spread out over multiple datacenters around the world; however even though all attempts made so far have failed due to these factors alone, there is still a chance someone might eventually find out about them someday because nothing lasts forever even when done properly unless precautions are taken beforehand against all eventualities which unfortunately isn't possible in this case because as far as anyone knows only one person owns them which makes tracking him down impossible unless he reveals himself voluntarily somehow which leads me back where I started from at square 1 again… anyways my point is that if something like this does happen then not only will our organization suffer greatly but also the entire world could end up being destroyed by whoever gets their hands on these resources first because they could easily use them against us without us being able do anything about it until it's too late… but enough rambling already! Let's talk business shall we? How much do you charge per month for unlimited access like this? And what kind of payment methods do you accept? Also please tell me where exactly all your servers are located at since I need those details before anything else! ???????: You really don't know who I am do you? Or what my company does?! Well let me enlighten ya then! My name is [REDACTED] (I refuse giving my real name away just yet!) and my company provides services such as hosting websites/servers/virtual machines etcetera… oh wait a minute here comes another customer support message….<br><br>[A few seconds later…]<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>So uhm.. yeah.. sorry 'bout that… anyways please continue with whatever information you wanted share with me earlier before getting distracted by another customer support message from another user… thanks!:) [Subject continues typing…]<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Uhmm.. hello?! Are u still there?! Hello?! …………..:| <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After waiting several minutes for a response from Subject now known as [REDACTED], none came despite numerous attempts made by both parties via chat messages sent back and forth between each other over several days now during which time Subject seems completely oblivious towards everything happening around him except his work related tasks according To his chat logs anyway . Due t o t h i s F e n c e d S c i e n t i s t s h a v e b e e n p r o m p t l y assigned new Project Head duties until further notice while awaiting approval from O5 Command concerning new containment procedures concerning <i>SCP-10</i> 204 , including but not limited too possibly shutting down its service temporarily while searching through its databases using sophisticated computer programs designed specifically fo r thi s purpose until said approval comes through .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10204.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10204-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-10204, a Level 2 researcher assigned to <i>SCP-10204</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-10204 was instructed to create a server on <i>SCP-10204</i> and upload various files onto it. These files were chosen at random from the Foundation's database and consisted of various documents, images and videos. After this had been done, D-10204 was asked to shut down the server. The shutdown request was then sent through the support ticket system of <i>SCP-10</i> 204 . After waiting for several hours with no response from support agents or any changes in its Terms of Service or other anomalous activity, D- 10 204 was instructed to shut down the server manually using standard means. When this failed as well due to an unknown error message appearing after several minutes, D - 10 204 was instructed again via support ticket system to shut down the server manually using standard means . Once again , an unknown error message appeared after several minutes . No further attempts were made by any personnel assigned to SCP - 10 204 due to previous failures and potential risks involved with them (see Experiment Log 10204 - 2 ) .<br><br><b>Results: </b>None; all data remained intact on both servers despite one being shut down by manual means while connected directly into a power socket in Site ██'s mainframe room and another being shut down remotely by Level 2 personnel through its own control panel (both actions are normally not possible). All other tests performed during this experiment have led researchers nowhere but back here; results remain unchanged even when performed by different personnel who have no knowledge about previous experiments (see Experiment Logs 1020 4 - 3 , 1 020 4 - 4 , 1 020 4 - 5 , 1 020 4 - 6 ) .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It seems that there is some sort of entity behind SCP – 1024 04 that is able t o prevent any changes made within it from being seen outside of it without actually shutting them off completely ; we can only assume that these entities are also responsible for preventing access t o information regarding their location or ownership . This entity's motives remain unclear; all we know is that they seem intent on keeping us out of their network for whatever reason they might have. Based on our current findings I recommend upgrading SCP – 1024 04 ' s classification t o Thaumiel until more information can be gathered about these entities ; until then we will continue our research into finding out more about them as well as their origins if possible so we can find a way around whatever protection they might be hiding behind ( see Addendum 1 024 A )</div>
