All Snakes!!</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17535<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17535</i> is an extradimensional anomaly, which manifests as a large number of snakes in various sizes and colors. The snakes are capable of creating portals to other dimensions, allowing them to travel through space and time at will.<br><br>The snakes appear to be sentient, with each snake possessing its own unique personality and agenda. They have demonstrated the ability to communicate with each other telepathically, as well as with humans.<br><br><i>SCP-17535</i> appears to be attracted by human emotions such as fear or anger; if provoked, it will manifest itself in greater numbers than before. It has been observed that <i>SCP-17535</i> is particularly drawn towards individuals who display strong emotion or mental instability; this has led researchers to believe that the anomaly may be attempting to feed off of these emotions in some way.<br><br>Additionally, <i>SCP-17535</i> appears able to manipulate reality around it; objects within its vicinity have been known to move on their own accord or change shape without any visible explanation for why they did so. This effect seems more pronounced when there are more snakes present in the area at once; however, why this occurs remains unknown.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17535</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with a reinforced steel door and walls, as well as an automated security system that will detect any unauthorized entry into the chamber.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-17535</i> are to wear protective gear when entering the containment area, and are not allowed to interact with the anomaly in any way. All personnel must remain at least 10 meters away from <i>SCP-17535</i> at all times; if this distance is breached, personnel must immediately exit the area and report their actions to their supervisor.<br><br>In order to prevent further manifestations of <i>SCP-17535</i> outside of its containment chamber, all personnel assigned to it are required to undergo psychological evaluations<br><br><h3> Addendum 17535.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a containment breach occurred at Site-██. During the incident, <i>SCP-17535</i> was observed to have manifested in greater numbers than before; additionally, it appeared that the anomaly had gained control of several personnel and objects within its vicinity. All personnel were successfully contained and returned to their posts without further incident.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17535.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17535</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17535</i> was interviewed by Dr. ██████. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17535</i>. How are you today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17535</i>:</b> We are doing well. How may we help you?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I was wondering if you could tell me more about yourself and your abilities?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17535</i>:</b> We are a collective of extradimensional entities, capable of manipulating reality around us and traveling through space and time. Our primary purpose is to observe the universe, though we have been known to intervene in certain situations when necessary. We are also capable of communicating with humans, though this is not something we do often.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17535.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>The following is a log of experiments conducted on <i>SCP-17535</i>:<br><b><br>Experiment 1:</b> A single snake was placed in an isolated chamber and observed. The snake displayed no anomalous behavior, instead choosing to curl up and sleep. After approximately two hours, the snake vanished without a trace.<br><b><br>Experiment 2:</b> Two snakes were placed in an isolated chamber and observed. They quickly began communicating with each other telepathically; after several minutes, one of the snakes created a portal to another dimension before both disappeared through it.</div>
