<style>.justifier {  text-align: justify;  text-justify: inter-word;}</style><div class='justifier'><i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> is  a blue box.<br><br><h5>Item #:</h5> <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i><br><br><h5>Object Class:</h5> Safe<br><br><h5>Special Containment Procedures:</h5>  <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. No testing is permitted.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> appears to be a standard ██████ brand Bluetooth speaker, circa 2016. When SCP-9014 is paired with an iPhone or other iOS device running the Pandora mobile app, the subject will begin to exhibit symptoms of acute depression. The subject will refuse to leave their bedroom and cease all contact with friends and family for extended periods of time. If containment protocols are not followed, subjects may become catatonic or commit suicide.<br><br>Testing has shown that the device is not anomalous; however, any subject who uses it will be affected by its anomalous properties. It was initially discovered in ████ after several people were found exhibiting similar symptoms at a house party in ██████████. Further investigation revealed that one person at the party had used SCP-9014 while another person had been playing music from their phone on a different Bluetooth speaker. This lead Foundation authorities to believe that either both devices were contaminated or one was an elaborate hoax rigged up by the resident DJ using his friend's speaker as part of a prank intended for someone else at the party (See Addendum).<br><br>The audio quality produced by SCP-9014 is identical to other Bluetooth speakers on market today; however subjects who use it report hearing an unidentified male voice repeatedly saying "you're okay" over top of whatever music they are playing through it. In addition, when questions regarding this anomaly have been posed online using any social media platform or internet forum, users will report receiving private messages from accounts whose names appear as "You're Okay" over and over again until they unsubscribe from said service/forum/social media platform entirely [See Test 914/GPT2]. At this point there has been no indication that these messages originate from anyone other than users themselves, but additional testing is required before making such bold claims about its originator(s) [See Addendum 2].<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9014 was discovered in ██████, California after several people were found exhibiting similar symptoms at a house party in ██████████. Further investigation revealed that one person at the party had used SCP-9014 while another person had been playing music from their phone on a different Bluetooth speaker. This lead Foundation authorities to believe that either both devices were contaminated or one was an elaborate hoax rigged up by the resident DJ using his friend's speaker as part of a prank intended for someone else at the party (See Addendum).<br><br><br><h5>Addendum 9014.1:</h5> Interview Log<br><br><h5>Interviewed: ██████ ██████████ Interviewer: Dr. █████ <Begin Log> Dr. █████: Good morning, Mr. ██████████. How are you doing today? SCP-9014-1: I'm okay…I guess. I still can't believe this is happening to me… Dr. █████: Can you tell me what happened at the party last week? SCP-9014-1: We were all having a good time and then it got a little weird…everyone started going a little crazy for some reason and it freaked me out so I decided to go upstairs and check my phone for messages or something, but when I turned the screen on, Pandora was already open! And someone had been playing that song "You're Okay" over and over again! All of my friends still think that's why we're all acting like this but really this thing just showed up out of nowhere! Dr. █████: Is there anything else you can remember from that night? Anything strange or unusual? SCP-9014-1(shakes head):</h5> No…that's everything other than those voices in my head telling me how much of a piece of shit I am every second of every day now… <End Log><br><br><br><h5>Addendum9014.2:</h5> Test Log<br><br><h5>+ Test 914/GPT-01 - Hide Test #:</h5> 914/GPT-01<br><br><h5>Subject(s):</h5> D-9014-1, a 24 year old female of European descent, non religious. Previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety.<br><br><br><h5>Procedure:</h5> Subject is instructed to play music via SCP-9014 for 30 minutes.<br><br><br><h5>Results: No effects are seen until the subject is told to stop listening to music. The subject begins crying hysterically and reports hearing "You're Okay" repeatedly in her head despite no audio being played by any device besides SCP-9014 at this time. After 5 minutes she ceases all movement and sits motionless until sedation can be administered by Dr. ██████ <Begin Log> Dr. ██████:</h5> D-9014, please step out of the booth so we can begin testing on you now…<br><br><br>D-9014 remains still; however her breathing becomes louder as she begins tearing up again (Note - the subject had been informed that further testing would be required after initial interview)<br><br><br><h5>Dr. ██████: D-, please move now or I will be forced to remove you physically from the room! (The subject does not respond) Dr.(shouting): Damnit! Get her out of there now! (Security personnel enter booth) Security Officer 1(to other officer): What do you want me to do?
