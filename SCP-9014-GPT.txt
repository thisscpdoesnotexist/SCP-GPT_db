The bottle seems to be made out of an unknown material able to resist most forms of damage, including fire and explosives. When the cap is removed, the liquid inside can be drunk by any person or animal, but will not cause any changes in the drinker's state of mind. After a while however, the effects of <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> will kick in and people drinking it will become sober again. This effect only works when <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> was opened for more than 1 minute before being used on someone else though. If <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> isn't opened for at least 1 minute before being used on someone else though, it won't have any effect on them at all.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> クリスマスには普通のセキュリティの再調整でもいいのですが、それ以外は何かと忙しくて…<br><br><i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> was found inside of a garage owned by ████████, after the police recieved reports of a break in. When the police arrived at the location, they found <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> and traced it back to ████████.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9014.1 :</h3> Interview with ████████<br><br><br>Interviewed: ████████<br> Interviewer: 私は9014と9014-GPTについてよく知りたいので、取り調べをします<br> Subject: <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> and <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i>-<br>GPT Interviewer: So, could you tell me what exactly you used the beer to do? ████████: Yeah… well, I was at my friends house one day and he had a lot of beer. I couldn't drink it all by myself so, after a while I saw this bottle lying around that looked like some sort of whiskey or something. So… yeah. That's how it all started really.<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9014.2 :</h3> Unidentified Material found in <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i><br><br>A sample of the material was sent to Dr. ██████ for further investigation, who then told me that it is an unknown form of silicon and its effects on people and animals who drink <i>SCP-9014-GPT</i> isn't fully understood yet. I'm not sure if we should classify the bottle as Safe or Euclid though…<br><br></div>
