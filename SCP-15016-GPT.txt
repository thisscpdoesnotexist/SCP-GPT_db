Could you please state your name for the record? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Yes, my name is ███████ . <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation so far Mr… [Dr. █████████ appears to pause] Mr…? <br><br><b>███████: </b>[laughs] It's alright doctor, I know what this is about and I can assure you that there's no need for any sort of secrecy here - as long as we're all on the same page anyway! [Agent ███ begins taking notes] So how can I help you today? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Firstly we'd like to ask why it was that you made those edits on Wikipedia regarding our organisation? We understand if it was just a joke or something like that but we would like some clarification if possible! <br><br><b>███████: </b>Oh yes of course doctor! Well firstly let me say thank-you for taking time out of your day to talk with me about this in person - most organisations wouldn't bother with something so trivial as this would they? No matter really though because it's not every day one gets a chance to speak with someone from such an esteemed organisation such as yourselves! Let me start by saying that I have been following your website ever since its conception - back when it was still called The Secure Containment Initiative wasn't it?! The idea behind what you guys do is fascinating and honestly quite revolutionary in my opinion; however there are some things which have always bothered me about what exactly happens within these facilities isn't there?! For example why are some objects contained while others are left out in the open where anyone could get their hands on them?! Why do certain individuals receive special treatment over others when they've done nothing wrong!? And finally how does one go about becoming part of such an esteemed group which helps keep our world safe!? My questions were never answered until recently however when after reading through several articles regarding different anomalies contained within Foundation facilities; specifically regarding <i>SCP-15016</i> itself - at least according to its article anyway - after reading through all those paragraphs upon paragraphs describing everything from its creation right down to its containment procedures; well let's just say something clicked inside my head and everything suddenly fell into place didn't it?! It became clear then that everything had been laid out before me in plain sight yet somehow I had missed seeing any of these connections until now hadn't I!? At first I thought maybe someone else had already discovered these connections before but after searching through every single article related directly or indirectly towards The Foundation myself along with scouring various message boards dedicated towards discussing various topics related towards anomalous phenomena including yours… well unfortunately no other users seemed aware of these connections either did they!? Even more interesting than all that though were certain comments posted by other users under each respective article including comments posted under <i>SCP-15016</i> itself weren't there?! These comments were written by people claiming knowledge regarding certain aspects relating directly or indirectly towards The Foundation themselves weren't they? Now although at first glance many people might dismiss them outright due their lacklustre presentation; however once looked into further more often than not turned out be surprisingly accurate didn't they!? Now although many members claim ignorance upon being questioned further despite having knowledge pertaining directly or indirectly towards The Foundation themselves aren't they? This implies two possibilities doesn’t it doctor?: 1) Either members involved are lying outright OR 2) Members involved genuinely don’t remember making said comments OR 3) Members involved genuinely don’t remember making said comments AND lying outright at the same time OR 4) Members involved genuinely don’t remember making said comments AND lying outright at the same time BUT instead claim ignorance due being threatened/paid off/blackmailed etcetera etcetera!! What do think doctor?? Which one sounds most likely?? After reading over numerous articles including <i>SCP-15016</i> itself along with looking into numerous posts made by other users underneath each respective article became clear pretty quickly that someone must have been watching us closely right down too every<br><br><h3>Addendum 15016.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15016-A<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-82362, a Level 1 security guard at Site-19.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-82362 was given a laptop and instructed to create an account on Wikipedia.
