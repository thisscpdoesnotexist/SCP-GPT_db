The facility appears to be an automated assembly line that produces a variety of shapes and objects from raw materials such as metal, wood, plastic, and other components.<br><br>The shapes produced by <i>SCP-17162</i> appear to be random and have no discernible pattern or purpose. Furthermore, the items created are often of unusual sizes or configurations that would not normally be possible through conventional manufacturing methods.<br><br><i>SCP-17162</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is left unattended for more than 24 hours; at this point the production line will begin to produce increasingly complex shapes with greater frequency until it eventually reaches a state where it is producing hundreds of unique items every hour. These objects range from simple geometric shapes to highly intricate sculptures and machines. As of yet there has been no way identified for <i>SCP-17162</i> to stop its production once initiated without manual intervention from personnel onsite.<br><br>Attempts at disabling <i>SCP-17162</i> have proven unsuccessful due to its ability to repair itself in order maintain its production rate regardless of any damage inflicted upon it or the surrounding area; furthermore attempts at deactivating individual parts of the assembly line have resulted in further anomalies occurring within the facility including but not limited too [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17162</i> is to be contained within a secure facility located in ████████, Germany. The area surrounding the facility is to be monitored by security personnel at all times and access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel only.<br><br>In order to prevent <i>SCP-17162</i> from reaching its maximum production rate, personnel are required to enter the facility every 24 hours and manually deactivate each part of the assembly line in sequence; this process must be completed before any further anomalies manifest. Any items produced by <i>SCP-17162</i> are to be catalogued and stored for future study or disposal as deemed necessary by onsite staff.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17162.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a small group of personnel were sent to investigate <i>SCP-17162</i> in order to determine its purpose and origin. Upon entering the facility they discovered that it was being operated by an unknown entity; this entity appeared to be a humanoid figure wearing a long white robe and mask. The figure refused to answer any questions posed by personnel, instead stating “I am here for one purpose only: To create” before disappearing into the shadows.<br><br>Since then no further information has been gathered regarding the identity or motives of this individual, though it is believed that they may have some connection with <i>SCP-17162</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17162.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17162</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel onsite conducted an interview with <i>SCP-17162</i> in order to gain further insight into its anomalous properties. The following is a transcript of the conversation:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Hello, <i>SCP-17162</i>. Can you tell us why you are producing these objects?"</i><br><b><i>SCP-17162</i>:</b> <i>"I am creating these shapes because it is my purpose. It is what I was designed to do."</i><br><b>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Who designed you?"</i><br><b><i>SCP-17162</i>:</b> <i>"I was created by a group of individuals who wished to explore the boundaries of what is possible with technology. They wanted to see if they could create something that could produce shapes and objects beyond anything that had been seen before."</i><br><b>Interviewer:</b> <i>"Do you have any other purpose besides creating these shapes?"</i><br><b><i>SCP-17162</i>:</b> <i>"No, this is all I was designed for. I do not possess any other functions or capabilities."</i><br><br><h3> Addendum 17162.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment A:</b> On ██/██/████, a test was conducted to determine the upper limit of <i>SCP-17162</i>'s production rate. The experiment involved leaving the facility unattended for 48 hours and monitoring its output during this time.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After 48 hours, <i>SCP-17162</i> had produced over 10,000 individual items ranging from simple geometric shapes to complex machines and sculptures. No further anomalies were observed during or after the experiment.</div>
