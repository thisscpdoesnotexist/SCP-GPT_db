The Foundation was contacted after reports of the house being haunted by an unknown entity were made. When <i>SCP-10095</i> was brought to Site 19, it started showing anomalous properties and was classified as an anomaly.<br><br><i>SCP-10095</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is worn by a human being, changing his/her personality into one of three <br><br><b>personalities: </b><i>"The Happy One"</i>, <i>"The Sad One"</i> or <i>"The Angry One"</i>. The wearer's mood matches with his/her current personality but will not change if he/she puts off <i>SCP-10095</i> or if another person wears it. Also, if someone else tries to wear <i>SCP-10095</i> while somebody else already has it on him/herself then that person will be affected by its anomalous properties instead and will take on the new personality until he/she removes <i>SCP-10095</i> from his head or another person wears it again (the latter case resulting in two persons having different personalities). If someone who has put off <i>SCP-10095</i> tries to wear it again then all of its previous effects are gone and no new ones appear upon wearing it for the second time (although some people report feeling uncomfortable when putting on SCP- 100 95 again). Also, even though none of its effects are present while wearing other masks they still appear when trying to take them off . This happens because all masks seem like part of your body once you start wearing them . When this happens , you can't feel anything except for your face , so you can't touch anything but your own skin . You can't see anything either because there is nothing but darkness around you . Once you've taken off any mask , everything goes back to normal . You can touch things properly now and see properly too , just like before putting on any mask at all . It seems that this effect only occurs with masks that have been worn for more than 5 days straight without taking them off even once during that period . Sometimes people who have been affected by this effect begin hearing voices telling them what they should do next ; these voices tell them things such as: <i>"put on [insert name here]'s mask"</i> or <i>"take [insert name here]'s mask"</i>. After hearing these voices several times over several days , those affected begin doing exactly as told<br><br><h3>Addendum 10095.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br>+ Interview Log 10095.2 - Hide Interview Log <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ ██████, a D-Class personnel who was affected by <i>SCP-10095</i>'s anomalous properties. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Ivanov </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview took place two days after the incident in which Agent Ivanov put on <i>SCP-10095</i> and killed Agent Fyodorova . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr . <br><br><b>Ivanov: </b>So , Mr . ███████ , can you tell me what happened that night ? D - <br><br><b>Class: </b>Of course I can but it's not my fault ! It was that mask ! It made me do it ! Dr . <br><br><b>Ivanov: </b>Can you describe to me what exactly happened ? D - <br><br><b>Class: </b>Well , I came back to my room after work and saw the mask lying on my bed so I decided to try it on just for fun since nobody else had tried it before… [D - Class pauses] …and then everything went dark and I heard voices telling me what to do next… [D – Class pauses again] …I don't know why but they told me that if I wanted to be happy then I should kill someone named <i>"Fyodorova"</i> so…I did exactly as they said and killed her with a knife from the kitchen… [D – Class pauses again] …then everything went back to normal except for one thing ; when trying to take off any mask now, there is nothing around me except darkness even though there are things in front of my eyes like walls or doors or whatever else you can think of…it feels like wearing masks has turned them into part of your body somehow while taking them off turns them into something completely different instead…. Dr . <br><br><b>Ivanov: </b>That's quite interesting….Thank you very much for your cooperation Mr. ███████, we'll be seeing each other soon enough <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was concluded, Mr. ███████ was terminated because he had been exposed too long without taking off his face masks<br><br><h3>Addendum 10095.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-73453, a female Caucasian. She was chosen for this test because she was the only one who didn't have any mental problems and had no history of violence . Also , she seemed to be the most sane out of all other test subjects . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject put on <i>SCP-10095</i>. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject's personality changed into <i>"The Angry One"</i> and she began screaming at the researchers to get away from her. After being told several times to calm down, subject calmed down and removed <i>SCP-10095</i> from her head . <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It seems that <i>SCP-10095</i> has a mind of its own ; it has been proven that it can change its wearer's personality even if he/she doesn't want it to do so . Also , this is the first time we've seen someone remove an anomalous object from their body without any outside help (in this case, removing SCP- 100 95 by herself) Test #: 2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 7 3 453 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as Test #1 <br><br><b>Results: </b>Same as Test #1 <br><br><b>Notes: </b>We'll try testing with another person wearing it next time Test #3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 7 3 453 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as Test#1 <br><br><b>Results: </b>Same as Test#2 <br><br><b>Notes: </b>This is getting weird… I don't think we should test with anyone else wearing it yet…</div>
