The safe is to be kept in Dr ███████'s office.<br><br>Dr ███████ has been given Level 4 clearance and has been tasked with finding out what makes <i>SCP-15321</i> so special, why it causes people to act like bears when they watch it.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15321</i> is a show on CBeebies about a family of bears who live in the woods. The show is about an hour long and has been shown for over twenty years. When <i>SCP-15321</i> is watched by any human being, they will start to see themselves as one of the characters in the show, and will act like them.<br><br><i>SCP-15321</i> came to our attention when it was reported that all of the children at ██████ Primary School were acting like bears. Children were seen climbing trees and eating berries from them, as well as sleeping in dens made from branches.<br><br>I have been tasked with finding out what makes <i>SCP-15321</i> so special, why it causes people to act like bears when they watch it. I have found that if you do not watch more than half an episode (approximately 22 minutes) then you are safe from its effects.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15321.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted in order to find out what makes <i>SCP-15321</i> so special. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr ███: Hello, can you tell me about the show? ████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>It's a show about bears. Dr ███: What do the bears do? ████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>They just live in the woods and stuff like that. Dr ███: And how long have you been watching it for? ████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>Since I was little, I think it must have been shown on TV since I was born. My parents used to watch it all the time when they were kids too. Dr ███ nods his head and writes something down on his clipboard before speaking again… Dr ███: Thank you for your time, that is all we need from you today <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It seems that <i>SCP-15321</i> has been around since at least 1980 and has affected many people over its life span. The fact that everyone who watches it sees themselves as one of the characters shows us that there is more to this than meets the eye .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15321.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15321-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92321, a convicted murderer. He has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was told that he had to watch <i>SCP-15321</i> for an experiment, and was given a remote control so he could pause it if he wanted to. D-92321 was then put in a room with two guards, who were armed with tranquilizer guns in case of an emergency. The episode <i>"Bears on Wheels"</i> was then played for the subject via DVD player. The subject watched the episode until it ended at 22 minutes and 3 seconds into the show (approximately half way through). After this point, no anomalous activity occurred until the end of the experiment when D-92321 asked what happened next in the show before being sedated by guards using tranquilizers after becoming aggressive towards them when they tried to take away his remote control.</div>
