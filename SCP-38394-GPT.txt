<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-38394 is a metaphysical anomaly manifesting as a perpetual conflict between two entities resembling mythological beasts, designated SCP-38394-A ("Unicorn") and SCP-38394-B ("Quetzalcoatl"). SCP-38394-A appears as a white stallion with a singular spiral horn projecting from its forehead, surrounded by an aura of spectral light. SCP-38394-B presents as a feathered serpent of considerable length, its scales shimmering in a multitude of colors, with an elongated plumed crest extending from its head.</p>
<p>The entities seem locked in a continuous battle where neither gains a lasting advantage. Their skirmishes are said to represent the balance of forces within our reality. Observers report that the entities appear to reset their conflict in different locations, often taking the form of natural disasters or miraculous events. The ensuing effects range from contained weather anomalies to anomalous healing and rejuvenation of devastated ecosystems. </p>
<p>Neither entity has been observed to sustain permanent harm, and both exhibit abilities associated with their respective mythologies, such as healing, purification, manipulation of weather and natural elements, and potential reality restructuring. </p>
<p>The true nature, purpose, or origin of SCP-38394 remains unknown, and it presents a challenge to classification due to its intangible and apparently essential role in maintaining a form of global equilibrium.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Due to SCP-38394's ethereal and intangible nature, physical containment is impossible. Its unpredictable manifestation and mobile pattern warrant a containment approach that is more observational and preventative in nature. Assigned personnel are to monitor global phenomena for patterns indicative of SCP-38394's activities, with a special task force (code-named "Mythos Shield") on standby to respond to any major event.</p>
<p>Foundation mythological experts and thaumaturges are tasked with deciphering historical texts and artifacts to better understand the connection between SCP-38394 and the health of our reality, possibly devising limited engagement strategies.</p>
<p>Containment efforts are to focus primarily on information suppression and public misdirection regarding any manifestations, branding them as hoaxes, illusions, or natural phenomena. Witness amnestics are to be administered when necessary. Cooperation with global governments and organizations may be sought under the guise of disaster mitigation or ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Incident Reports</h3>
<h4>Addendum 1A: Manifestation Log</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Central America, near ancient Mayan ruins</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A tropical storm abruptly dissipated, leaving behind an array of vibrant plant growth. SCP-38394-B was witnessed by Foundation agents engaging SCP-38394-A in the eye of the storm.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Addendum 1B: Witness Interview</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interviewee:</strong> [REDACTED], local resident</li>
<li><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent ████</li>
<li><strong>Excerpt:</strong> "[REDACTED] told me she saw the serpent in the sky, lashing out with lightning, and the unicorn on the ground, glowing like a star. Then the storm broke, and it was like the jungle came alive again. I saw it too, but it can't be real, can it?"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Research Notes</h3>
<h4>Addendum 2A: Thaumaturgy Studies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Lead Researcher:</strong> Dr. ███ █████</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Ongoing studies indicate that SCP-38394's presence causes fluctuations in local thaumic fields, restoring or disrupting an area's latent magical energies. Long-term patterns suggest a balancing effect over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 38394-E01</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To observe the direct interaction between SCP-38394 entities and human subjects.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-class personnel are placed at a predicted manifestation site in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The entities did not manifest physically but caused a surreal environment where reality appeared highly malleable. D-class personnel experienced profound euphoria and displayed temporary anomalistic abilities. Further observation required.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 38394-E02</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To test the effects of ancient artifacts believed to be linked to SCP-38394 on the frequency of manifestations.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Artifacts were placed in a triangulated position around an expected manifestation site.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Increased manifestation frequency observed. Entities exhibited greater intensity in their duel, causing wider thaumaturgical ripples. Artifacts glowed intensely and were slightly altered in appearance post-event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 4: Theoretical Implications</h3>
<h4>Addendum 4A: Multiverse Stability Hypothesis</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> Dr. ████ ████████</li>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> The ongoing investigation suggests SCP-38394 may be a regulator of a meta-stable multiverse. Our reality might exist within a delicate balance controlled by the duel. Further discovery could reveal mechanisms for reality preservation or even potential control over existential threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-38394 continues to be an object of significant interest due to its possible importance in maintaining the fabric of our reality. It stands as a reminder of the Foundation's mandate to preserve normalcy, even when faced with phenomena that are anything but.</p>
