<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15265</i> is  a concrete building located in New Mexico</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15265</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15265</i> is to be contained within a 10m x 10m x 10m room . <i>SCP-15265</i> is to be monitored at all times by two security cameras and one microphone . Any personnel entering <i>SCP-15265</i> are to wear a blindfold at all times while inside the building.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15265</i> is a concrete building located in New Mexico. <i>SCP-15265</i> was built in the early 20th century, and has been abandoned since the mid-20th century. <i>SCP-15265</i> is comprised of four floors, with each floor being identical to the next. The building itself is extremely large; with each floor being approximately three times larger than any other structure within ███ miles of it.<br><br><i>SCP-15265</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual enters <i>SCP-15265</i> and closes their eyes for a period of time longer than five seconds (hereby referred to as subject). When subject reopens their eyes, they will have no recollection of how they entered or exited the building. This effect only occurs when subject's eyes are closed while inside <i>SCP-15265</i>; if subject opens their eyes while still inside, they will be able to exit through one of several doors on each floor (see Experiment Log 1526 for more details).<br><br>When subjects enter and close their eyes for a period longer than five seconds within <i>SCP-15265</i>, subjects will experience vivid hallucinations that are unique to them . These hallucinations do not occur if subjects open their eyes before five seconds have passed . Subjects' hallucinations always take place in an area that matches the style and design of the rest of <i>SCP-152655</i> . These areas appear similar to areas found within buildings from around 1920s America , despite having modern amenities such as electricity , plumbing , etc . Despite this , there does not appear to be any way out from these rooms besides exiting through one door or another (see Experiment Log 1526 for more details) After experiencing these hallucinations , subjects report feeling disoriented and confused upon exiting through one door or another ; however , this confusion usually wears off after several hours have passed .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15265.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, who entered <i>SCP-15265</i> on ██/██/19██.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. [REDACTED] </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. [REDACTED]: </b>Hello, █████ . How are you feeling? <br><br><b>█████: </b>I'm fine, I guess. <br><br><b>Dr. [REDACTED]: </b>Good to hear it. Now, would you mind telling me what happened when you went inside of <i>SCP-15265</i>? <br><br><b>█████: </b>Well…I walked in and closed my eyes for a few seconds…and then I opened them and there was this room with all these people staring at me…and they were all wearing clothes from the early 20th century and they were talking about something but I couldn't hear them because it was so loud outside of the room…and then someone came up to me and asked if I wanted to play a game with them . And then he grabbed my hand and led me into another room where there was a bunch of other people playing cards , but one of the players had their head cut off . And that's when everything went dark …or maybe light ? But not really light , more like darkness but also light at the same time . And then everything went black for a second before I woke up here (subject points to chair across from interviewer) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Subject seemed confused after interview ; however , subject did not experience any side effects after interview besides slight confusion as stated above.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15265.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15265/1 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15265-1 (Male, age 32)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-15265</i> and close their eyes for a period longer than five seconds. After subject closed their eyes, the door was locked and two security cameras were set up in the room. Room was then monitored until subject exited through one of the doors.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reported seeing a large white room with several other individuals inside it . Subject described these individuals as being <i>"A bunch of people I've never seen before."</i> These individuals did not appear on any of the security cameras while they were inside <i>SCP-152655</i> . When asked how they exited the building , subject stated that an individual in a black suit appeared next to them and told them that they had been chosen to represent [REDACTED] in this year's election. When asked what [REDACTED] is , subject replied <i>"I have no idea"</i> and denied ever hearing about it before. Security footage shows that after exiting through one door , subject walked around for approximately ten minutes before leaving through another door . This cycle continued for approximately two hours until security footage showed D-15265 walking into a wall instead of exiting through one of doors . After this point , D-15265 became unresponsive ; however , he did not report feeling any pain or discomfort from hitting his head against a wall for two hours straight . He has since been administered Class A amnesiacs and returned to duty at Site ██. Analysis showed that during this time period, there were no walls within <i>SCP-152655</i> aside from those separating each floor (see Experiment Log 1526).<br><br></div>
