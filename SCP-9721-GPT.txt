When worn, it has an endless volume, and can hold up to 682 kg of material. The items inside <i>SCP-9721</i> cannot be removed or added without opening the bag first.<br><br>When an item is taken out of <i>SCP-9721</i>, it will appear in the closest possible place to where the bag was opened after 2 minutes have passed. If no room for the item has been made in that time frame, it will appear inside <i>SCP-9721</i> again.<br><br><i>SCP-9721</i> was found at ███████ High School in ██████████, USA on 11/04/20██ during a routine inspection by MTF Theta-90 (<i>"Mole Rats"</i>). It was being used by one of the students as a storage device for contraband material such as drugs and weapons; however when questioned about its origin he claimed that he had received it from his father (who had died before his birth). After confiscation and testing with D class personnel confirmed its anomalous properties, Foundation agents embedded within local law enforcement were ordered to arrest all students who knew about <i>SCP-9721</i>'s existence; all but one complied willingly with interrogation procedures. The school's principal later committed suicide via gunshot wound to the head after being informed of his involvement with a group known as <i>"The Church"</i>. As per protocol upon discovery of any organization associated with <i>"The Church"</i>, MTF Gamma 9 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>) was tasked with creating false leads back to other groups believed hostile towards humanity (such as GOI:s such as Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd., The Serpent's Hand and Chaos Insurgency). All other potential instances of <i>SCP-9721</i> are currently under investigation by MTF Epsilon 7 (<i>"Pony Express"</i>).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9721.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9721</i>-1, who was found to be the only student of ██████████ High School who knew about <i>SCP-9721</i>'s anomalous properties. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after the student had been interrogated by Agent ████, and before he was administered Class B amnestics. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>So, you're telling me that you got this backpack from your father? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9721</i>-1: </b>Yeah, I mean he died before I was born or anything but yeah…he gave it to me before he left for Iraq when I was like 12 or something like that… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>And how did you know that this bag had anomalous properties? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9721</i>-1: </b>Well my friend told me about it actually…he said they were gonna use it to smuggle drugs into school so we could sell them at a higher price during lunch break and stuff…I didn't really believe him at first but then when I tried putting some stuff inside there myself it worked so yeah… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>What happened with your friend? Did they get arrested too? <i>SCP-9721</i>-1 looks down on the floor and sighs deeply before responding; his voice is shaking slightly as he speaks. <i>SCP-9721</i> - 1 : No no no no….my friend didn't make it out alive in fact (SCP - 9721 - 1 pauses for several seconds) He died due to a drug overdose; apparently someone spiked his drink with heroin or something like that (SCP - 97 21 - 1 pauses again). You see my father used to work for some sort of security company in Iraq right? They'd give us these backpacks because we'd have to walk through dangerous areas sometimes where there might be bombs planted on the ground or whatever so we could put our gear inside them just in case something happened while we were walking through those places (SCP - 97 21 - 1 pauses again). Well apparently whoever made these backpacks must've been friends with my dad because they put an extra layer of protection around them so even if one of those bombs went off near us nothing would happen except maybe losing an arm or leg but nothing else (SCP – 9 7 2 – 1 pauses once more). So after a few weeks working there everyone started getting paranoid about getting blown up all the time and started taking their own precautions by carrying around guns and knives everywhere they went just in case something happened plus since my dad knew how much money we would make from selling all our contraband material he decided to take some extra supplies with him just incase someone tried stealing any of our stuff while he wasn't looking right? Like if anyone came close enough without us noticing then boom! We'd shoot them dead without hesitation! But well one day while walking through this area called <i>"The Valley Of Death"</i> which is pretty much what its name implies; everything goes quiet except for birds chirping away happily unaware of any danger nearby until suddenly BOOM! A bomb goes off somewhere behind us sending shrapnel flying everywhere cutting up people left right and center including killing most people working under my dad along with himself as well leaving only 2 survivors including myself barely alive lying on top each other hoping against hope that help will arrive soon enough since both our legs are gone making movement impossible not counting the fact that half our bodies are covered in blood making breathing difficult due to lack oxygen reaching vital organs such as lungs etcetera etcetera etcetera….so eventually help does arrive thankfully along with paramedics who rush over towards us immediately upon arrival asking if either one of us can move at all which is impossible considering what state both bodies are currently in plus also considering how badly injured both bodies are already makes moving even harder than usual let alone moving each other out from under debris covering most parts of both corpses preventing rescue workers from extracting victims' remains until further notice meaning extraction can only occur once victims' remains have been removed completely hopefully saving lives still remaining trapped underneath rubble possibly waiting desperately for rescue workers' arrival despite being severely injured themselves probably wishing death upon themselves instead living a life devoid misery caused by severe injuries sustained during explosion possibly wishing death upon themselves instead living a life devoid misery caused by severe injuries sustained during explosion <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement : After hearing what had happened between <br><br><h3>Addendum 9721.3 : </h3>Interview with <br><br>Experiment 9721-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>One D-class personnel equipped with a camera.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to take pictures of the inside of <i>SCP-9721</i> while wearing it. The bag was then closed and placed on a table, and the camera was removed from <i>SCP-9721</i>. After 2 minutes had passed, the camera reappeared inside <i>SCP-9721</i>. All pictures taken were of an empty bag, despite being taken in rapid succession by a fully loaded camera (see Addendum 9721.4).<br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected; however all photos were completely blank (see Addendum 9721.4).<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that objects taken out of <i>SCP-9721</i> are rendered invisible to any form of recording device or human eye for some reason; however it is still possible for them to be seen by other means such as touch or smell (see Experiment 9724). - Dr ██████<br><br></div>
