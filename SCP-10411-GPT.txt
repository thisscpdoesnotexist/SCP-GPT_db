A Foundation investigation revealed that these disappearances were linked to an isolated group of LARPers, who all had similar experiences.<br><br><i>SCP-10411</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual enters the property which <i>SCP-10411</i> occupies. Individuals entering this property will be transported back in time approximately one hour before they arrive, but with no memory of what has happened during that period, nor any knowledge as to how they arrived at their current location. The individuals will remain in this state until either sunrise or sunset occurs, at which point they will appear back at the same location from which they disappeared with no memory of what has happened during that period either. This cycle will continue indefinitely until the individual dies by natural causes or leaves <i>SCP-10411</i>'s property through a gate on its southern border marked <i>"EXIT"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-10411</i> was first discovered after reports from local residents regarding several individuals disappearing and reappearing near them led law enforcement agents to investigate the area surrounding where these incidents occurred. Several witnesses reported seeing several individuals dressed as fantasy characters such as elves and dwarves appearing out of thin air before disappearing again shortly afterwards; one witness described it as if she was watching an episode from her favourite TV show but just missing something important everytime she blinked (see addendum). Law enforcement agents eventually traced these disappearances back to a house located on ██████ Road, where several members belonging to <i>"The Royal Order Of The Phoenix"</i> live together under one roof; it is unknown how many members belong within this group due to them being unable to recall each other's names upon exiting <i>SCP-10411</i>'s property . As per standard protocol regarding containment breaches involving SCPs posing little threat, MTF Alpha 6 (<i>"Blanket Men"</i>) were sent into <i>SCP-10410</i> while wearing amnestics resistant clothing so as not compromise themselves should they be exposed by accident . Upon entering SCP 10410 , MTF Alpha 6 found evidence suggesting that there had been multiple breaches within its borders including shattered windows and doors , bloodstains , scorch marks on walls , paintings depicting violent scenes such as murder scenes painted over with pictures depicting idyllic countryside landscapes . After further investigation , MTF Alpha 6 discovered thirteen corpses scattered around various locations<br><br><h3>Addendum 10411.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ████████, a member of <i>SCP-10411</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Hello, my name is Agent █████████. I'm here to ask you some questions about your community. Is that alright? ███: Yeah sure, I guess so. What do you want to know? Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Well for starters could you tell me how long have you been living in this area? ███: Uh… It's been about a year now; we moved in together after we graduated from high school last year. Why do you ask? Are we in trouble or something? Agent █████████ (pauses): No no no! You're not in any trouble at all! We're just trying to find out what happened here and who did it. That's all. ███ (sighs): Okay then… So uh… what else do you want to know about us then? Agent █████████ (pauses again): What can you tell me about the people who live with you here at this house? Do they have names or something like that perhaps? ███ (laughs nervously): Oh yeah right! Like I would remember their names after only knowing them for a year or so right?! Besides, they don't even remember each other's names either; hell I don't even remember my own name most of the time when I wake up on our lawn every morning . Not that it matters anyway since none of us can leave the property anyways . And besides , if someone does leave by accident , they'll just reappear back inside the property anyways . So why are we being held captive anyways ? This is bullshit man ! Why won't anyone believe us?! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview , <i>SCP-10411</i> was administered Class-C amnestics and released back into society without incident<br><br><h3>Addendum 10411.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 10411-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-91339, a Caucasian male in his mid-twenties. Subject is to enter <i>SCP-10411</i>'s property through the front gate and wait for one hour before leaving through the exit gate. <br><br><b>Results: </b>D-91339 enters <i>SCP-10411</i>'s property at ████:██ hours. At ████:██ hours, D-91339 disappears from view and is transported back in time approximately one hour before he entered SCP 10411's property . He reappears at ████ hours but does not leave the area. At █████ hours, D-91339 appears to be confused as to why he has returned here again; he then begins screaming incoherently while repeatedly banging his head against a nearby wall until blood starts pouring down his face. After approximately ten minutes of this behaviour, D-91339 dies from cranial trauma and is transported back into SCP 10411's property after sunrise occurs (approximately five minutes later) with no memory of what happened during that period . Autopsy reveals that there are no abnormalities within his brain or any other part of his body except for a slight increase in serotonin levels which can be attributed to stress caused by being trapped within an endless time loop . Test #: 10411 -2<br><br>Subject:D - 91456 , A Hispanic female in her early twenties wearing a nun costume . Subject is instructed to enter SCP - 104 11 ' s property at nightfall through the exit gate , wait for one hour before leaving through the same exit gate , then reenter again using the same entrance point and wait for another hour before exiting once more using the same entrance point <br><br><b>Results: </b>As per standard protocol regarding containment breaches involving SCPs posing little threat , MTF Alpha 6 were sent into SCP - 1041 1 while wearing amnestics resistant clothing so as not compromise themselves should they be exposed by accident . Upon entering SCP - 1041 1 , MTF Alpha 6 found evidence suggesting that there had been multiple breaches within its borders including shattered windows and doors , bloodstains on walls scorch marks on walls paintings depicting violent scenes such as murder scenes painted over with pictures depicting idyllic countryside landscapes . After further investigation MTF Alpha 6 discovered thirteen corpses scattered around various locations inside it (see addendum) . Following this discovery MTF Alpha 6 proceeded towards where they believed was where D - 91456 had entered from ; upon reaching it they found traces of human footprints leading away from it but did not find any trace of her whereabouts afterwards despite searching every room inside it except for two ; these rooms were locked shut with chains preventing access inside them but when agents attempted to force their way inside them they found that these chains were attached directly onto their frames without any visible means of support or attachment whatsoever making entry impossible without destroying them first which would compromise security protocols regarding its containment ; however when agents attempted to destroy said chains with cutting tools attached onto robots sent into both rooms they discovered that said chains were impervious towards all forms of damage inflicted unto them including laser beams fired at close range capable penetrating thick steel plates easily yet failed miserably when attempting to cut either chain apart even slightly indicating some form of advanced technology used in creating these chains which require further investigation by Foundation scientists assigned specifically towards researching anomalous materials used in creating SCPs requiring further research into how exactly these materials work if possible; also worth noting is that both doors are made out wood yet have metal hinges attached onto their frames instead showing signs indicating some form of advanced technology being used on them too due possibly having been created out carbon nanotubes or graphene sheets reinforced via nanobots injected directly underneath their surface rather than conventional means due possibly requiring less energy needed when compared against conventional methods considering how thin each sheet seems whilst still retaining its strength properties required being able test objects weighing up thousands pounds each without breaking under pressure thus making such methods far more efficient than conventional ones ) Agents also discovered several paintings resembling crime scene photographs hanging on several walls throughout this house depicting various disturbing images including dismembered body parts strewn across floors bloody corpses hung upside down mutilated bodies piled high upon each other etcetera all painted over with pictures portraying idyllic countryside landscapes upon closer inspection however agents noticed something strange about all these paintings ; namely how none depicted anything happening during nighttime despite all occurring during nighttime according to reports given by witnesses interviewed earlier suggesting some</div>
