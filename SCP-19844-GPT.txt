<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19844 is  the La Brea Armpits</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19844<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19844</i> is a phenomenon located in the La Brea Tar Pits, Los Angeles County, California. It consists of an area approximately 1 kilometer wide and 500 meters deep which contains a large number of human arms embedded in tar. These arms are capable of movement, though they lack any apparent means to do so.<br><br>The arms are constantly attempting to reach out towards any living creature that enters the area. Attempts to remove them from the tar have been unsuccessful thus far. Any attempts made by personnel or creatures entering the area will be met with extreme force from all surrounding arms, resulting in severe injury or death if not avoided quickly enough.<br><br>Any attempts at communication with <i>SCP-19844</i> have been unsuccessful thus far as well; however, it is believed that its actions may be driven by some sort of instinctive need for sustenance and/or protection due to its inability to move away from its current location.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-19844</i>, it is impossible to contain or relocate it. As such, a perimeter of 500 meters has been established around the area in order to prevent any unauthorized personnel from entering. Any personnel attempting to enter must be accompanied by at least two armed guards and are required to wear protective gear at all times.<br><br>In addition, an automated system has been set up which will detect any movement within the area and alert nearby personnel immediately should anything occur. All personnel entering the area must be briefed on how to avoid contact with <i>SCP-19844</i> as well as how best to respond should contact occur.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19844.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a team of researchers was sent to investigate the area and attempt communication with <i>SCP-19844</i>. After a few minutes of observation, it became clear that the arms were attempting to reach out towards the researchers. The team quickly retreated and no further attempts have been made since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19844.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19844</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers led by Dr. ██████ entered the area to attempt communication with <i>SCP-19844</i>. Upon entering, the arms began to move towards the team in an aggressive manner, though they stopped once Dr. ██████ spoke out loud in a soothing voice.<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello? Can anyone hear me?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19844</i>:</b> Yes…we can hear you…<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> What is your purpose?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19844</i>:</b> We exist to protect this area…to keep it safe from those who would seek to harm it. We will do whatever it takes to keep this place safe.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19844.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 19844-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a D-Class personnel was sent into the area with a camera in order to observe and document any changes or activities. Upon entering the area, all arms immediately began reaching out towards him. After approximately 30 seconds of observation, he was able to identify that the arms were attempting to grab onto his clothing and limbs. He quickly fled from the area and reported no further contact with <i>SCP-19844</i> after that point.</div>
