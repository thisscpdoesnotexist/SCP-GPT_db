<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9982</i> is a really long baseball bat able to smash things through other universes</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9982</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9982</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker. No personnel are allowed to touch <i>SCP-9982</i> unless it is for testing purposes.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9982</i> is a baseball bat that was found at the bottom of the Pacific ocean. It is made out of wood and has a length of 2.4 meters. The object was found by the SCP foundation after reports from nearby ships about an unidentified object floating in the sea. When someone touches <i>SCP-9982</i>, it will teleport them to another universe (See Addendum 9982-1). After testing, it seems that when someone touches <i>SCP-9982</i> they will be teleported to another universe where they are at the same location but there are some differences between both universes:<br><br>The person's appearance will change (hair color, hair style, skin color etc.)<br><br>The person's personality changes as well (someone who is shy can become more outgoing for example)<br><br><i>SCP-9982</i> itself also changes its appearance and characteristics depending on what universe it teleports people to. It can appear as a sword or even an axe depending on which universe you are teleported too. The only thing that doesn't change is how long <i>SCP-9982</i> actually is no matter what form it takes in other universes . This means that if you touch <i>SCP-9982</i> in one universe then touch it again in another one then you will be sent back to your original universe .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9982.1 : </h3>**********<br><br>The following is a list of the different universes that <i>SCP-9982</i> has been teleported to:<br><br><h3>Addendum 9982.2 : </h3>Interview with **********<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ********** </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Doctor ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>********** was one of the first people to touch <i>SCP-9982</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Doctor <br><br><b>██████: </b>Hello, my name is Doctor ██████.
