When police arrived at the scene, <i>SCP-14654</i> was recovered along with all patients who were affected by <i>SCP-14654</i>'s anomalous effect.<br><br><i>SCP-14654</i>'s anomalous effect manifests when someone watches it and causes them to become aggressive and hostile towards others around them unless they are restrained or watched by someone else while watching <i>SCP-14654</i>. Those affected by this effect will also experience paranoia and hallucinations that cause them to believe that there is something wrong with their body such as having insects crawling under their skin or feeling like they are losing blood even if no wounds are present on their body. These symptoms will only cease if those affected watch another copy of <i>SCP-14648</i> but this time without any physical contact between those watching it (i.e using headphones). Once these symptoms cease, those affected will return back to normal unless they watch another copy of <i>SCP-14864</i> again where these effects will repeat itself once more like an endless cycle until death occurs due to cardiac arrest from cardiac arrhythmia caused by stress or heart attack caused by over exertion during hallucinations .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14654.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14654</i>-1, a 19 year old male who was affected by <i>SCP-14654</i>'s anomalous effect. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, I am Dr. ██████ and I will be conducting your interview today. <br><br><b><i>SCP-14654</i>-1: </b>What the fuck is this? Where are you taking me? Get off of me! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please calm down and answer my questions or else we will have to sedate you again until you're ready to cooperate with us. (<i>SCP-146441</i> calms down) Thank you for cooperating with us now can you tell us what happened when you were watching the tape? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14654</i>-1: </b>It was nothing special really, it just showed a hospital that looked like it was abandoned until some people started running out of it screaming like crazy men and then a black faced thing jumped from the camera to attack them as if they were possessed by something evil…no wait…I think I'm going crazy! Why am I talking about this shit?!<br><br>Dr . <br><br><b>█████: </b>Do not worry , we are here to help . Now please continue on what happened after that . (SCP - 146441 continues) SCP - <br><br><b>146441: </b>One of those people got attacked by that black faced thing which caused him to scream in pain as if he was getting tortured before he fell on the ground dead while everyone else ran away from there as fast as they could while screaming like madmen too even though no one attacked them except for that guy who got killed by whatever that thing is….I think…I think..I'm going insane! Help me please!!!<br><br>Dr . ███: It's alright , we are here to help but first tell us where did all of this happen ? (SCP - 146441 pauses for 2 minutes before answering)<br><br>SCP - <br><br><b>146441: </b>In Mexico at an abandoned hospital near [REDACTED] but why do y'all want t know where did all this happen ? Is there something wrong with me ? Am I sick or something?!<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>.████████: </b>No , your fine but just answer our questions so we can help you get better so please continue on what happened next after everyone escaped from there including yourself ?(SCP – 14644 continues)<br><br>SCP – <br><br><b>164641: </b>Well…after everyone escaped from there except for myself since someone had locked the door behind them trapping me inside along with those things …well let's just say everything went downhill after that point ….(scp – 14644 pauses again ) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After questioning, subject became agitated and attempted suicide via hanging himself using his bed sheet which failed due to intervention from guards stationed outside his cell until subject calmed down enough for him to be sedated once more until further notice<br><br><h3>Addendum 14654.3 : </h3>Experiment Log:<br><br>Experiment-14654-A:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-95831, a 34 year old male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to watch <i>SCP-14654</i> and report any anomalous effects after watching it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After watching <i>SCP-14654</i>, subject reported feeling of paranoia and hallucinations that caused him to believe that there was something wrong with his body such as having insects crawling under his skin or feeling like he was losing blood even if no wounds were present on his body. These symptoms ceased when subject watched another copy of <i>SCP-14864</i> but this time without any physical contact between those watching it (i.e using headphones). Once these symptoms ceased, subject returned back to normal .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It seems that the only way for subjects affected by SCP 14654's effect to return back to normal is by watching another copy of it without any physical contact between those who are affected by its anomalous effect which means that anyone who watches the tape must be restrained before they watch it so they can't harm themselves or others around them until they return back to normal . Experiment - 14654 - B: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 95832 , a 32 year old female . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to wait in front of a room where SCP - 146442 is being played while wearing headphones so she can't hear anything from outside the room while she watches the footage inside the room alone until someone enters into her cell and tells her what happens inside the footage after she finishes watching it . <br><br><b>Results: </b>After finishing SCP - 14644 , subject reported seeing black faced entities jumping from one person's head onto another person's head causing them both screaming in pain before falling on ground dead before other people ran away from there screaming like madmen too even though no one attacked them except for those two people who got killed by whatever those things are….I think…I think..I'm going insane! Help me please!!! <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It seems that once someone watches this footage without anyone else around them while they watch this tape, black faced entities will jump out at random intervals towards whoever watches this tape which causes anyone who sees these entities attacking others nearby go insane due to stress caused by fear until death occurs due to cardiac arrest from cardiac arrhythmia caused by stress or heart attack caused by over exertion during hallucinations . Experiment – 14864 – C <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D – 95833 , a 29 year old female <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed not tell anyone about anything related about experiment unless given permission otherwise along with wearing headphones so she couldn't hear anything from outside along with being restrained during experiment. Results When asked about experiment after testing ended, subject became agitated and attempted suicide via hanging herself using her bed sheet which failed due to intervention from guards stationed outside her cell until subject calmed down enough for her be sedated once more until further notice</div>
