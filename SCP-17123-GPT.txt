<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17123 is  a particularly carnivorous breed of eggplant</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17123<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17123</i> is a species of eggplant (Solanum melongena) that possesses an extreme level of carnivorous behavior. <i>SCP-17123</i> appears to have evolved from a normally herbivorous strain, and displays traits not found in any known existing species.<br><br><i>SCP-17123</i> has the ability to move and hunt for prey, primarily small mammals such as rodents, birds, and occasionally lizards or snakes. It does this by using its leaves to create sound waves which it uses to locate potential prey items within its vicinity. Once located, <i>SCP-17123</i> will then use its stem to rapidly propel itself towards the target item before consuming it whole with its fruits. In addition, <i>SCP-17123</i> has been observed exhibiting an increased level of aggression when provoked or threatened in any way; often attacking whatever is closest in range regardless of size or strength.<br><br>It should be noted that while <i>SCP-17123</i> does possess some form of intelligence, it appears limited only to hunting behavior and basic problem solving skills; showing no signs of higher cognitive functions such as language comprehension or abstract thought processes.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17123</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with an automated feeding system, capable of providing <i>SCP-17123</i> with a steady supply of small mammals and other suitable prey items.<br><br>Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear protective gear and remain vigilant for any signs of aggression from <i>SCP-17123</i>. In the event that it does display aggressive behavior, personnel are to immediately evacuate the area and contact security personnel for assistance.<br><br>In addition, all research involving <i>SCP-17123</i> must be approved by Level 4 or higher personnel before being conducted.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17123.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a group of researchers attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-17123</i> by exposing it to various forms of audio stimuli. After several hours of experimentation, the plant appeared to respond positively when exposed to classical music; displaying an increased level of calmness and responsiveness. Further testing is currently underway in order to determine if further communication can be established with <i>SCP-17123</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17123.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ███████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ███████, can you tell us more about <i>SCP-17123</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Yes, of course. <i>SCP-17123</i> is a particularly carnivorous breed of eggplant that has evolved from a normally herbivorous strain. It uses sound waves to locate prey and then propels itself towards the target item before consuming it whole with its fruits. In addition, it exhibits an increased level of aggression when provoked or threatened in any way; often attacking whatever is closest in range regardless of size or strength.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17123.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> To test the limits of <i>SCP-17123</i>'s predatory behavior, a live rat was placed in its containment chamber. The rat was then observed for 15 minutes as it attempted to escape from <i>SCP-17123</i>. After 10 minutes, the eggplant had successfully tracked down and consumed the rodent.<br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> <i>SCP-17123</i> is capable of hunting and consuming prey items much larger than itself with relative ease.</div>
