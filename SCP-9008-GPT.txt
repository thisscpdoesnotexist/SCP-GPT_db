Interaction with SCP-9008 is only permitted under the supervision of at least one level 4 researcher and two level 2 guards.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9008-GPT</i> is a small wooden child in the height of 2 meters. SCP-9008 has large amounts of brown hair, and is covered with crudely carved facial features. SCP-9008 has large amounts of wood throughout its body, with most notably his cock being made out of wood. SCP-9008's heart is located under his cock instead of the normal location on the left side of a humans chest.<br><br><br>When exposed to an adult human male, SCP-9008 will begin to grow its penis until it reaches an average length size for humans. If said human male does not ejaculate while exposed to SCP 9008, it will shrink back down and return back to its original state after 10 minutes when exposed to a different male human or any other humanoid subject that ejaculates upon exposure with no change in size or length of said penis . Once the penis returns back to normal size for 20 minutes after exposure from any one subject , It loses all anomalous properties and becomes non sentient as well as no longer exhibiting attraction for other males . It remains this way until another male ejaculates onto it once again . If not kept under observation at all times by researchers , Any previous test subjects that have been exposed before will begin talking about how they know what makes them happy , And then proceed by strangling themselves until they are dead due to loss pressure from their penises becoming too big if they do not ejaculate soon enough .<br><br><br>After Incident 900914/2 where Dr ████ accidentally took off his pants during testing while within close proximity with 9008 GPT, He was promptly gagged and blindfolded along with having 3 security guards restrain him as he begged for mercy before being taken into temporary containment along with 90080 GPT during post incident deconstruction measures before removing them from immediate area for further testing outside containment cell while awaiting transferral into a more permanent cell structure at [REDACTED] facility..<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9008 were found within a forest outside of [REDACTED] village. The local police department had received reports from the locals of people going missing in that area, and sent out search parties to look for any possible leads.<br><br>They eventually discovered an abandoned shack, with two humanoid creatures inside. These creatures had been reported as being very violent towards the search party and attacking them on sight . One member of the team took note of one creature having a tree growing out from between his legs , while another mentioned that they looked like normal humans otherwise . After making contact with them, they identified themselves as <i>SCP-9008-GPT</i> and refused to come along peacefully , instead opting to attack the team head on . The team opened fire and killed both instances before reporting their findings back to headquarters.<br><br>The bodies were taken back to Site 13 for study , where further analysis showed that these humanoids were indeed sentient despite their appearance , And had been living in those woods for quite some time now after being abandoned by a group held religious cult who had fled into nearby forests after being raided by law enforcement due to allegations of child abuse which caused these anomalies along with several other humanoid anomalies which have yet be discovered at large at this time For containment purposes..<br><br><h5>Addendum 9008.1:</h5><br><br><br><h5>Addendum9008.2:</h5><br><br><i>SCP-9008-GPT</i> has been cleared for testing with other humanoid subjects.
