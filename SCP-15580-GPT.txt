<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15580</i> is  a boiling kettle of Earlgray tea</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15580</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15580</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Testing with <i>SCP-15580</i> is currently suspended pending further research into the effects of <i>SCP-15580</i> on subjects.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15580</i> is a boiling kettle of Earlgray tea. It has no anomalous properties until it is poured into a cup and consumed by an individual. Once consumed, the subject will begin to grow another set of arms and legs, as well as begin to secrete a new set of internal organs. This process takes approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete.<br><br>Once completed, the subject will have gained the ability to create any liquid they desire from their own body at will, but only through one orifice at a time (mouth/nose/ears). The amount that can be created at once is dependent on how much liquid is already in their system. In addition, subjects are able to control these liquids with extreme precision in order to form limbs for themselves if necessary (this does not require additional organs).<br><br>In addition, subjects are still able to consume food normally through their mouth even after this change has occurred; however they must drink water regularly in order for them not to dehydrate as quickly as normal humans would due to having more openings for fluid loss than normal humans do (approximately 2x more). Subjects also seem unable or unwilling (to date)to communicate with others about what has happened after consuming <i>SCP-15580</i>'s contents; however they do seem capable of understanding speech directed towards them normally despite having no visible ears or vocal cords during testing.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15580.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Subject ████ █████, a D-class personnel who has consumed <i>SCP-15580</i>'s contents.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. █████████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after subject was discovered to have been affected by <i>SCP-15580</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Good morning, Mr.██████, how are you feeling today?<br><br>Subject <br><br><b>████: </b>I'm fine thanks doctor, just a little thirsty is all… [Subject drinks from glass of water provided] Ahh that's better… So what do you want me to do now? [subjects eyes begin to turn into small puddles of water] Oh god damn it! What the hell is going on!? Where are my eyes!? Where are my goddamn eyeballs!? [subject begins screaming loudly and flailing around erratically in his seat]<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Calm down please Mr.██████ we don't know why this happened yet and we need your help in order to find out! Please try to remain calm for now until we can get some answers for you! [subject calms down slightly but still appears distressed] Thank you very much; now could you describe what happened before this started happening?<br><br>Subject ████:[after being prompted multiple times by Dr. █████████ subject begins speaking slowly with considerable difficulty due to lack of vocal cords.] Well I woke up at about 5am as usual like any other day and got ready for work; I went through the same routine every day since I've worked here at Site-19 so there wasn't anything unusual about that part of the day except that it took me longer than normal because one of my arms decided it wanted to sleep in today instead of getting up with me like he usually did…I guess he was tired or something but anyway I got dressed then went downstairs and made myself breakfast which consisted of 2 eggs sunny side up and a glass of orange juice…Then when breakfast was done I poured myself a cup o' tea from the kettle as always then sat down at the table with my book while waiting for breakfast time so i could finish reading it before work started….then….then……..[subject trails off into incoherent mumbling]. Then what happened after that doctor? You said there were some unusual things about yesterday besides your arm falling asleep on ya' yeah? What else did happen man?! Tell us already! We ain't got all day here ya know! Shit man hurry up already we're running outta time here doc!! Please tell us doc!! Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaase!!! PLEASE TELL US WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKING SHIT MAN FUCK THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE MAN FUCK THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE MAN FUCKKKKKIIIIIINNNNGGGG SSSSHHHIIIIIIIITTTTT MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKK YYYYOOOOOUUUU AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGG GGGGGGG OOOOOOOOOOOO UUUPPPPPPPP PPRREEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEE TTTTTTTHHHEERRREEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAHhhhhhhhhhhh fuckkkkkkkk…..[At this point subject began coughing violently which caused him great pain due to his new anatomy.] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After approximately 1 hour had passed since beginning the interview, <i>SCP-15580</i> began its effects again upon subject causing him great pain until he expired 1 hour later due to blood loss caused by internal bleeding caused by rapid growths forming throughout his body (See Addendum 15580b). Autopsy reports show no signs that death was caused directly by <i>SCP-15580</i> itself however; instead it seems likely that death occurred due to severe internal trauma from repeated spurts of liquid being ejected from various orifices within subjects body which were uncontrolled at this point (see Experiment Log 15580b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15580.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log:<br><br><b>Notes: </b>It is unknown how <i>SCP-15580</i> has been able to maintain a constant temperature of 100°C for the duration of testing. Further research into the properties of <i>SCP-15580</i> is required. -Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9123, male, age 32 <br><br><b>Notes: </b>Subject was chosen due to his apparent lack of any family or friends and his willingness to help <i>"the cause"</i> (D-9123 was informed that he would be helping in an experiment regarding SCP-███). <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was given a cup containing contents from <i>SCP-15580</i> and instructed to consume it all in one sitting. <br><br><b>Results: </b>1 hour and 45 minutes later, subject began growing limbs as per usual; however instead of growing internal organs they began secreting water through their pores at an accelerated rate. When questioned about what had happened, subject replied <i>"I don't know man, I just started leaking everywhere."</i> <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Further research into why subjects are unable or unwilling to communicate with others after consuming contents from <i>SCP-15580</i> is required in order for us to ascertain whether it's anomalous effects have been negated by this action or if this is simply a side effect caused by whatever happens when someone consumes its contents. -Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Notes: </b>This test was repeated with D-1112 who had been convicted of multiple counts of murder and rape prior to being incarcerated; however no anomalous properties were observed during testing despite the fact that she consumed twice as much liquid as D-9123 did previously (approx 4 liters). It appears that only those who are on good terms with others prior to consuming its contents will experience these effects.- Dr. ██████ Subject A: D - 9 123 , male , age 32<br><br>Subject B: D - 11 12 , female , age 23<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Both subjects were instructed not tell anyone else about what happens when they drink from 155 80 .
