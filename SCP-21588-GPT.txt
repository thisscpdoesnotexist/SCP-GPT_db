After this initial outburst, it will proceed to cry hysterically for approximately five minutes before ceasing all movement and becoming dormant again.<br><br><i>SCP-21588</i> carries an unknown virus that causes extreme paranoia in those exposed to it. The virus can be spread through physical contact with <i>SCP-21588</i> or its clones (see below). Those infected with the virus experience delusions of being followed or watched, as well as feelings of intense fear and anxiety when exposed to any form of media or communication technology. In extreme cases, these symptoms can lead to complete mental breakdowns resulting in insanity or death.<br><br>Every time <i>SCP-21588</i> becomes dormant after screaming “I AM THE UOLLIAC!” it will produce one clone identical in appearance but lacking any memories or personality traits associated with its original host body. These clones are capable of independent thought and action but lack any sort of moral compass; they are driven solely by their instinctual desire for self preservation and reproduction via creating more clones like themselves whenever possible using the same method as their progenitor (i.e., standing still until another clone appears).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21588</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell should be equipped with video surveillance and sound dampening technology to prevent any potential spread of the virus.<br><br>Personnel entering <i>SCP-21588</i>’s containment chamber must wear full body protective suits and face masks at all times, as well as gloves and boots that have been treated with an antiviral agent. Any personnel exposed to <i>SCP-21588</i> or its clones are to be quarantined immediately for observation and treatment if necessary.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21588.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-21588</i> was observed to be in the process of cloning itself. All personnel within the containment chamber were immediately evacuated and the area was sealed off until further notice.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21588.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21588</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21588</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-21588</i>, can you tell me why you scream “I AM THE UOLLIAC!”?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21588</i>:</b> I… I don’t know. It just comes out of me whenever someone is near. I don’t want to do it but it happens anyway. Please help me make it stop!<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> I’m sorry, but we don’t know how to make it stop. Can you tell me anything else about yourself?<br><b><br><i>SCP-21588</i>:</b> No… I just want the screaming to stop. Please help me!<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-21588</i> was returned to its containment cell after the interview.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21588.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log:</b> On ██/██/████, an experiment was conducted to test the effects of <i>SCP-21588</i>’s virus on a human subject. The subject was exposed to <i>SCP-21588</i> for two minutes before being removed from the containment chamber and monitored for any signs of infection.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After two minutes of exposure, the subject began exhibiting symptoms consistent with those infected by <i>SCP-21588</i>’s virus; they experienced intense paranoia and fear, as well as feelings of being watched or followed even when alone. These symptoms persisted for several days before gradually diminishing over time until completely disappearing after approximately one week.</div>
