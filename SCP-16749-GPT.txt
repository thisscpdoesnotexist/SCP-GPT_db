The <i>SCP-16749</i> has the ability to move at speeds of up to ███ km/h, and can also use its tentacles as weapons. It has a very large appetite, but is not hostile unless provoked.<br><br><i>SCP-16749</i> was contained in an object known as <i>SCP-16749</i>'s ship, which Dr. ██████ found in the Bermuda Triangle while on vacation with his family. He then brought it back home where he studied it for 2 years before bringing it to the Foundation's attention when he discovered that there were other objects like this one in other places around Earth (See Addendum 16749A). After studying it for several more weeks, he decided to bring it into containment so that other researchers could study its abilities and hopefully find out how to get rid of them if possible (See Addendum 16749B).<br><br><h3>Addendum 16749.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 16749.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-16749</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to get more information on <i>SCP-16749</i>'s origins.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, 16749, my name is Dr. ██████, and I'm going to be interviewing you today. Is that ok?<br><br><b><i>SCP-16749</i>: </b>Yes sir! What would you like me to do?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well, I'd like you to tell me about your home planet and how you got here if that's alright with you?<br><br><b><i>SCP-16749</i>: </b>Sure thing! My home planet is called [REDACTED], and it has a lot of treasure for pirates like me! It's also much bigger than Earth so there are many places for us to hide from the authorities when we're stealing treasure from other planets or whatever we're doing at the time! We also have these ships that can travel through space really fast and can hold up to 50 people in them at once! They're very cool ships indeed! That is where I am from sir, now what else would you like me to say? (Note by Dr.) Oh yes sir, one more thing before I forget; my people are very good with technology as well as being able to use magic too because they were originally wizards but then they found out how awesome technology was so they started using both magic AND tech together ever since then sir!! (End Note) But anyways…that's all I know about my home planet…now what else would ya' want ta' know about it!? Oh yes sir one last thing; we have a king who rules over us all but he usually lets the council do most of the work because he doesn't want too much responsibility on his shoulders ya' know!? Heh heh ha haa…haaaahhhahaha….(<i>SCP-16749</i> starts laughing uncontrollably) What did ya' say!? Did ya' just call me crazy?! Are ye calling 16749 crazy!? Ye better watch yerself matey or ye'll be walking the plank in no time!!! (<i>SCP-16749</i> begins cackling wildly while waving its tentacles around menacingly) AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHHAAHAHAAAHHHHHH!!!!!! (Dr. ███ attempts calming down <i>SCP-16739</i> by waving his hand in front of its face.) There there boyo', don't worry none now…..I didn't mean any offense by calling ye crazy….I just meant it as a joke…..there there……don't cry……don't cry…..(Dr.'s voice becomes muffled as SCP starts crying loudly into his chest). Ok ok ok calm down now….don't cry anymore…..(Dr.'s voice becomes muffled again). There there…don't cry anymore….you've been through enough already haven't cha'? No need ta' keep crying over something silly like this right lad?? There there….shhhh shhhh shhhhhhh……..shhhhhh…………ok ok let go of me now sonny boyo'. Alright now where were we again??? Oh yes that's right; please continue telling us about your home planet if you could please?? Thank you 16749.(Note by Dr.) Damnit why does this always happen every time someone mentions their homeworld??? Why does everyone always start crying when asked about their homeworlds????????? This makes no sense whatsoever!!!!! Why does everyone miss their homeworlds so badly after being away from them for only 2 years??? Ok let go back into character here before our experiment gets ruined again.(End note) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 16749.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Experiment: </b>16749-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-16749</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-16749</i> was given 2 live chickens to eat.
