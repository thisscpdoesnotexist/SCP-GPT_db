No personnel are permitted to enter the containment chamber without Level 3 authorization. <i>SCP-16181</i> is not allowed to leave its containment area under any circumstances . Any personnel found attempting to remove <i>SCP-16181</i> from its cell will be terminated immediately and replaced with D Class Personnel .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16181</i> is a Foundation front company operating out of the city of ████████. It was created to produce and distribute a single product, <i>SCP-16181</i>-1.<br><br><i>SCP-16181</i>-1 is a series of large robotic automatons, each with two arms and two legs, measuring approximately 1.5 meters in height and weighing approximately 300 kilograms at full capacity. The automatons are made from an unknown material that is resistant to all forms of damage except for that inflicted by <i>SCP-16181</i> itself (see Addendum 16181/2). Each unit has been programmed with extremely detailed instructions on how to perform their designated task; however, these instructions are not sufficient on their own for the units to complete their functions without human supervision or intervention.<br><br>Each unit has been programmed with extremely detailed instructions on how to perform their designated task; however, these instructions are not sufficient on their own for the units to complete their functions without human supervision or intervention . Each unit possesses numerous tools integrated into its body which it uses in order to accomplish its duties . These tools <br><br><b>include: </b>A drill capable of boring through any material except <i>SCP-16181</i> itself , A circular saw capable of cutting through any material except <i>SCP-16182</i> , Two pincers capable of gripping any object , Two hands capable of performing fine manipulation tasks such as typing or handling small objects , An arm mounted camera used for observation purposes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16181.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 16181.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████████, a technician working for <i>SCP-16181</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after the discovery of <i>SCP-16181</i> by Foundation agents and the subsequent containment of <i>SCP-16181</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>Can you describe to me how the automatons are produced? <br><br><b>████████: </b>Well, we first take a design from one of our engineers and then we use a 3D printer to create an initial prototype . Then we use that model as a template for the rest of them . We then give each unit its instructions and set it loose in whatever environment it's supposed to be working in . Once they're finished with their duties, they come back here so that they can be disassembled and used again later on if necessary . <br><br><b>Dr. ██████████: </b>And what is your role at this company? What do you do during your time here? <br><br><b>████████: </b>I'm just responsible for overseeing the production line itself; making sure everything runs smoothly, that sorta thing . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview, all instances of <i>SCP-16181</i> were contained by Foundation personnel and destroyed via incineration over an eight month period as per standard procedure when dealing with non-anomalous technology created by The Harriet Laboratory's R&D department.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16181.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log 16181-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>One <i>SCP-16181</i>-1 unit.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-16181</i> was instructed to enter its containment chamber and close the door behind it. The subject was then instructed to exit its containment chamber, walk down the hallway leading to the office of Dr. ███████, and enter that room. Upon entering the room, <i>SCP-16181</i> was instructed to use its drill in order to bore a hole through Dr. ███████'s desk and into his chair . Once this had been completed, <i>SCP-16181</i> was told to return back down the hallway and into its containment chamber .<br><br><b>Results: </b>As soon as <i>SCP-16181</i> entered its containment chamber it began walking towards the door leading out of it at a speed of approximately 2 km/h . It reached this door in approximately 5 minutes , whereupon it attempted unsuccessfully (due to an error in programming) for several minutes before finally giving up on opening this door . After waiting for approximately 20 minutes , subject began walking back towards its original position but stopped after only 1 minute when it encountered Dr. ███████ who had been notified by security staff about what had happened . Subject then proceeded forward again until reaching Dr. ███████'s office whereupon it used a small circular saw integrated into one arm in order cut through his desk before using another tool integrated into another arm in order bore a hole through his chair which took approximately 3 hours due to an error in programming . Subject then returned back down the hallway and once again attempted unsuccessfully (due to an error in programming) for several more hours before finally giving up on opening this door again , proceeding back towards its original position where upon after waiting for 15 minutes , subject started moving forward again until encountering Dr. ███████ once more who had been notified by security staff about what happened during Experiment 16181 - 1A after which he terminated Experiment 1618 1 - 1A immediately due to errors present within subject's programming causing him extreme concern regarding potential dangers associated with allowing such units free access throughout Site - 19 ' s facility without proper supervision or testing first being conducted beforehand</div>
