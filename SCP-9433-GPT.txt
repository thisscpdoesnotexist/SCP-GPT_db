Consult the template for guidance.】<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9433</i> is a shapeshifting creature that can take the appearance of anyone who sees it.<br><br>Seen from a distance, <i>SCP-9433</i> appears to be a human male of indeterminate age and build. It wears clothes typical of modern prison inmates in America, including orange pants and a white shirt. An electroshock collar is visible around its neck at all times.<br><br><i>SCP-9433</i> was first discovered in ████████ County, Georgia on 05/04/1997 after reports arose concerning an <i>"inmate"</i> at the ████████ County Correctional Facility who could change his appearance at will . Foundation agents were sent to the facility and were able to interview <i>SCP-9433</i> secretly; however, he would not provide any information as to how he became an inmate in the correctional facility or how he obtained his shapeshifting abilities. He did express interest in being moved to another cell as long as it was away from other inmates due to them attempting continuously to harm him with seemingly no motive or purpose for these actions beyond simple violence towards him . Agent █████□█ proposed moving <i>SCP-9433</i> into isolation within Site 19 based on this information; approval was granted by O5 command staff shortly afterwards, and <i>SCP-9433</i> has been contained at Site 19 ever since (see Addendum 9434). Due to its nature, only D class personnel are permitted access within 10m of SCP 9432's containment chamber without approval from site command staff .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9433</i> was discovered in ████████ County, Georgia on 05/04/1997. <i>SCP-9433</i> had been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of James H███████ and was being held at the ████████ County Correctional Facility. He had been observed by multiple prison staff members undergoing drastic physical changes during his incarceration at the facility; however, this behavior was attributed to him being <i>"crazy"</i> or <i>"on drugs"</i>. <i>SCP-9433</i> was discovered after a prison guard reported seeing him transform into a Doberman Pinscher before escaping from its kennel in the prison's dog pound .<br><br><i>SCP-9433</i> has stated that he cannot remember anything prior to waking up in his cell with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He asked several times if it were possible for him to be released; however, despite pretending to agree with this request and taking notes during interviews SCP 9432 has never actually provided any useful information as to<br><br><h3>Addendum 9433.1 :</h3><br><br>All attempts to remove the collar have been unsuccessful. Several attempts to neutralize <i>SCP-9433</i> by removing his collar failed, and it was decided that until further notice <i>SCP-9433</i> was not permitted to leave his containment chamber. After a week of confinement, the subject seemed to be in good spirits despite the nature of his situation and expressed interest in having more books brought into his cell. After several months passed, he began asking for other entertainment such as television sets or video games; these requests were denied on account of their potential for distraction from research being done on him by Foundation researchers.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9433.2 :</h3><br><br><br>Interviewed: SCP 9432 Interviewer: Dr.<br> ██████ Foreword: This interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9433</i> first arrived at Site 19. <Begin Log> Dr. ██████ enters the cell and approaches <i>SCP-9433</i> cautiously, taking note of the collar around his neck as he does so. He sits down on a chair facing <i>SCP-9433</i> and opens up a notepad on his lap, adjusting his glasses before speaking to him. Dr.<br> ██████ : Hello there, I'm Doctor ██████ with the Foundation; I've been sent here to observe you while you're here at Site 19 . You don't mind if we ask you some questions about yourself, do you? [<i>SCP-9432</i> nods] Alright then… well first things first; what is your name? [<i>SCP-9432</i> remains silent for several minutes] Uh… are you okay? Do you know how long it's been since we found out that someone like yourself was in America? If it weren't for reports from personnel working in prisons such as this one we wouldn't have known that people like yourself even existed! We thought that there were only four others in the country besides yourself , but now it turns out there's actually over two hundred of them! We're just trying to figure this all out right now so please answer my question; what is your name ? [<i>SCP-943</i> remains silent] Well if an object can shift its shape and mimic</div>
