Any individuals who enter the room are to be questioned and administered a Class-A amnestic before being released.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10124</i> is a classroom located in ████████, Germany. The room is furnished with desks and chairs, as well as a chalkboard and blackboard.<br><br><i>SCP-10124</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual enters the room while alone. When this occurs, they will be unable to leave <i>SCP-10124</i> until it has been left unoccupied for at least five minutes. Subjects report feeling <i>"trapped"</i> inside the room; however, they are still able to interact with objects within it normally. Subjects report feeling no compulsion to leave the classroom when others enter it; however, all attempts by multiple individuals to exit the classroom simultaneously have failed (see Addendum 10124-1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10124.1 : </h3> ██/██/████<br><br>During a test of <i>SCP-10124</i>'s properties, D-1234 was instructed to enter the classroom and remain inside for ten minutes. During this time, Dr. ██████ entered the room with three additional D-class personnel carrying a large wooden crate. After five minutes had passed, Dr. ██████ instructed the D-class personnel to leave; however, all four individuals were unable to do so until after another two minutes had passed (see Interview 10124-1).<br><br>Interview 10124-1:<br><br><h3>Addendum 10124.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ██████<br><br>+ Show Interview 10124-1 - Hide Interview 10124-1 <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-1234 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after the events of Addendum 10124.1. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Please state your name for the record, and describe what you experienced in <i>SCP-10124</i>? <br><br><b>D-1234: </b>Uh… yeah, sure… I'm ███ ██████, and I uh… felt trapped in there? It was weird; I could still move around and everything, but it just felt like if I tried to leave someone would stop me or something. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Did anyone else enter the room while you were inside? D-1234 pauses for a moment before responding. <br><br><b>D-1234: </b>No… no one else came in at all while I was there… (pause) except for that guy with the crate who came in with those other guys from earlier today, but he didn't stay long enough to count as <i>"someone"</i>. He left pretty quick once they got me out of there anyway; said he had somewhere else to be or something like that before leaving with them again. He looked kind of nervous too; kept looking over his shoulder at me even after he'd left through the door again when everyone else did too afterwards too like he was worried about something happening to him or something if we were still together or whatever so uh… yeah, that's about it really; nothing much happened after that aside from being taken back here again afterwards until this interview right now really so uh… yeah, not much more to say than that really since nothing more happened during my time inside there aside from feeling trapped and stuff anyways since nothing changed while I was inside apart from everyone leaving once they got me out of there again afterwards until this interview right now which is why uh…<i>" Dr. ██████ pauses for a moment before speaking again. Drs .You mentioned earlier how you described feeling "</i>trapped<i>" inside <i>SCP-10124</i>? Could you elaborate on what exactly made you feel this way?<br><br>D - 12 34 appears visibly uncomfortable during this portion of the questioning .<br><br>D - 12 34: Well , it's just...I don't know how best to describe it really other than saying it felt like if we stayed any longer then we'd get caught doing something bad by whoever owned whatever classroom we were stuck in at the time because none of us wanted to get into trouble by going into a classroom without permission first especially since none of us had any business being anywhere near them anyways since none of us knew where they led either so uh…"</i><br><br>Dr .: You're referring specifically towards classrooms located within schools , correct ?<br><br>D - 12 34: Yeah , pretty much ; some rooms looked different but most rooms looked similar enough between each other anyway so uh…"<br><br>Dr .: How many classrooms have you been stuck within ?<br><br>D - 12 34: Umm….I think maybe two or three total including today's one ? It's hard to keep track sometimes though because sometimes times can seem longer than others depending on how bored/tired/upset/annoyed etcetera someone might be feeling when stuck somewhere ; especially when trapped alone somewhere where no one can hear anyone scream either which is why whenever someone gets stuck somewhere alone where no one can hear them scream then they should always try calling out as loud as possible whenever possible until someone hears them otherwise otherwise they might not ever get found otherwise unless people are nearby who can help find them otherwise unless people are nearby who can help find them first unless people are nearby who can help find them first which is why whenever people get lost then they should always try calling out loudly as loud as possible whenever possible until someone hears their voice first instead because screaming helps attract attention faster than anything else does plus screaming helps attract attention faster than anything else does plus screaming also helps make sure whoever finds whoever gets found doesn't accidentally hurt themselves trying not hurt themselves trying not hurt themselves trying not hurt themselves trying not hurting themselves trying hurting themselves trying hurting themselves too plus screaming also helps make sure whoever finds whoever gets found doesn't accidentally hurt themselves trying helping finding whomever gets found instead either ; especially if whomever getting helped happens helping finding whomever gets found instead either ; especially if whomever getting helped happens helping finding whomever gets found instead either<br><br><h3>Addendum 10124.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-1234<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-1234 was instructed to enter <i>SCP-10124</i> and remain inside for ten minutes. During this time, Dr. ██████ entered the room with three additional D-class personnel carrying a large wooden crate. After five minutes had passed, Dr. ██████ instructed the D-class personnel to leave; however, all four individuals were unable to do so until after another two minutes had passed (see Interview 10124-1).<br><br><b>Results: </b>The crate was opened by Dr. ██████ and found to contain several items commonly used in German classrooms (e.g., textbooks, writing utensils). When questioned about these items, both the subjects and SCP Foundation personnel who observed them reported that they appeared normal in every way except for their unusual weight (the textbooks weighed approximately 50 kg each).<br><br><b>Subject: </b>A second set of four D class personnel were instructed to enter SCP 10124 while carrying a second crate identical to the first one; however, this time they were accompanied by Agent S███████ from Site 19's Anomalous Materials Department .<br><br><b>Results: </b>All six individuals were able exit SCP 10124 normally without difficulty after five minutes had elapsed since their entrance into it . The contents of the crates remained within them during this period; when opened again at Site 19 , both crates contained standard school supplies such as those listed above .</div>
