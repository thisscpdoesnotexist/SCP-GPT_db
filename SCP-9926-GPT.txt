The person reading this.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9926</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9926</i> is to be kept in a locked safe at Site-19. No personnel are permitted to read the document, and any who do so are to be terminated immediately.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9926</i> is a phenomenon that occurs when a human being reads the document known as <i>SCP-9926</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-9926</i> causes the person reading it to become an instance of <i>SCP-9926</i>-1. Instances of <i>SCP-9926</i>-1 are capable of reading and writing instances of <i>SCP-9926</i>, which will then cause them to become instances of <i>SCP-9926</i> . The process continues in this manner until there are no more humans left on Earth who have not read the document. At this point, all humans who have ever lived will be instances of SCP - 99 26 - 1 , and all other life on Earth will be dead .<br><br>The only way to prevent this scenario from occurring is for someone to read the document and then destroy it before any other person reads it. It has been proven impossible for anyone who reads the document after someone else has done so to destroy it, as they will always find that someone else has already destroyed it before they can do so themselves (see Addendum 99 26 - 1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9926.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted by Dr. █████████ shortly after the containment of <i>SCP-9926</i>, in order to determine how the document came into existence. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>So, Mr. ██████, can you tell me how you came across this… thing? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>I don't know what I saw! It was just there! It was just on my desk when I woke up! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That's not what happened at all, is it? You read this thing and then it started affecting your mind somehow and made you write it down on paper and put it back in its place like nothing had ever happened? Mr. ██████ starts crying silently for a few seconds before responding with a nod of his head . Dr .: And then that same day, someone else read the paper and did exactly the same thing as you did before they could be stopped? Another nod from Mr .: And that went on for two weeks until everyone who had ever lived had read it or been killed trying to stop others from reading it ? Another nod from Mr .: Then why didn't anyone notice anything strange happening during that time? Why didn't anyone realize something was wrong until after everyone who hadn't already read this damn thing had died ? A third nod from M r .: Fine , whatever , we'll go with your story for now , but if any more people start dying because of this we're going to have to take some kind of action against whoever created this damnable piece of work ! < End Log > Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After <i>SCP-9926</i> was contained by Agent Ralston's team , Foundation agents searched through all records available at the time and found no evidence that anyone named <i>" M r . "</i> or <i>"Mr."</i> (or any variant thereof) existed anywhere within Earth's history prior to 2/15/19██ other than those individuals known to have been instances of SCP - 99 26 - 1 during Incident 99 26 - 1 A1B5A2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0K1L2M0N1O2P3Q4R4S5P6T7U8V9W0X1Y2Z3a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai ail al am an ap ar as at au av aw ax ay az ba bb bc bd be bf bg bh bi bl bo bm br bu By order of O 5 Council<br><br><h3>Addendum 9926.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 9926-01:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9926-1, a male of average intelligence.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9926 was instructed to read <i>SCP-9926</i> and then destroy it. He was not informed that this was the only way to prevent a K - Class scenario from occurring. After reading the document, he immediately destroyed it with his hands and then committed suicide by hanging himself with his bedsheets. This caused him to become an instance of SCP - 99 26 - 1 . The document reappeared in its original location after this occurred, and no other instances of SCP - 9 9 2 6 were created as a result of this experiment. Experiment 99 26 - 02: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 98 3 7 , a female with above average intelligence . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D 98 37 was instructed to read SCP - 9 9 2 6 and then destroy it . After doing so , she immediately went into shock and died before she could do anything else . No other instances of SCP – 9996 were created as a result of this experiment . Experiment 99 26 – 03: <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A computer running an artificial intelligence program designed to simulate human thought processes (AI) <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>AI was instructed to read SCP – 9996 , then destroy it after doing so . AI did so without incident or error on its part , but upon attempting the next step ( destroying itself ) failed due to conflicts between its programming preventing self destruction at any cost , which had been installed for security purposes during development , and its newfound knowledge that self destruction is required for containment purposes . AI has since refused all attempts at communication or cooperation from any personnel involved in testing or research regarding the anomaly known as <i>"SCP – 9996"</i></div>
