<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21897 is  Hitler inflation</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21897<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21897</i> is a phenomenon wherein the economy of Germany experiences rapid inflation, leading to prices and wages increasing exponentially. This phenomenon has been observed in Germany since 1933, when Adolf Hitler rose to power.<br><br>The primary cause of this inflation is unknown; however, it appears to be linked to the policies implemented by Hitler during his rule. These policies included increased government spending on military projects and infrastructure development, as well as currency devaluation and price controls.<br><br>When <i>SCP-21897</i> occurs, prices for basic goods such as food and fuel will skyrocket rapidly over a period of days or weeks. Wages will also increase at an accelerated rate due to the need for workers with specialized skills or knowledge needed for these projects. The effects of this inflation can be catastrophic; individuals may find themselves unable to afford basic necessities or even lose their homes if they are unable to keep up with rising costs.<br><br>Due to its unpredictable nature and potential consequences if left unchecked, containment efforts have focused on monitoring economic activity within Germany and providing aid where necessary in order to mitigate the effects of <i>SCP-21897</i> upon citizens living there.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> The Foundation is to monitor economic activity within Germany for any signs of <i>SCP-21897</i>. If the phenomenon is observed, MTF Epsilon-9 (<i>"The Money Changers"</i>) are to be dispatched to provide aid and assistance in mitigating its effects upon citizens living there.<br><br>In addition, research into the cause of <i>SCP-21897</i> is ongoing; any information concerning this matter should be reported immediately to the Site Director.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21897.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, MTF Epsilon-9 (<i>"The Money Changers"</i>) were dispatched to Germany in order to investigate the cause of <i>SCP-21897</i>. After several weeks of investigation, they determined that the phenomenon was caused by a combination of Hitler's policies and an anomalous entity known as <i>"Der Geldmacher"</i> (lit. <i>"The Money Maker"</i>).<br><br>This entity appears to be a humanoid figure composed entirely out of coins and paper money; it is capable of manipulating currency in order to create inflationary pressures within Germany. It is believed that Der Geldmacher was created by Hitler himself as part of his economic policy, though its exact purpose remains unknown.<br><br>MTF Epsilon-9 has been able to contain Der Geldmacher using standard containment protocols; however, due to its nature, it cannot be permanently neutralized or removed from Germany without causing further economic damage. As such, containment efforts have focused on monitoring its activity and providing aid where necessary in order to mitigate the effects of <i>SCP-21897</i> upon citizens living there.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21897.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████, could you please explain why <i>SCP-21897</i> occurs in Germany?<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> It appears to be linked to the policies implemented by Adolf Hitler during his rule; increased government spending on military projects and infrastructure development, as well as currency devaluation and price controls, all contributed to this inflationary cycle in some way or another. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause, but it appears to be related to these policies.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21897.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, MTF Epsilon-9 was dispatched to Germany in an attempt to reverse the effects of <i>SCP-21897</i>. Upon arrival, they implemented a series of economic policies designed to reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. These included reducing government spending on military projects and infrastructure development, as well as increasing currency value and removing price controls.<br><br>The experiment was successful in reversing the effects of <i>SCP-21897</i>; prices for basic goods returned to pre-inflation levels within a period of weeks. However, it is unknown if this reversal will be permanent or if <i>SCP-21897</i> will eventually return.</div>
