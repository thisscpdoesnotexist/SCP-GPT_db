It is not to be removed from the containment locker under any circumstances, except for testing purposes.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15569</i> is a book with the words <i>"<i>SCP-15569</i>"</i> written on the cover, and nothing else. <i>SCP-15569</i> has been described as <i>"It's a book about the Foundation."</i> by all who have read it.<br><br>When an individual reads <i>SCP-15569</i>, they will gain knowledge of every anomaly that currently exists in Foundation custody. This includes information on their origin, containment procedures, and any other relevant information that may be known about them. However, this knowledge will only remain in effect until they finish reading <i>SCP-15569</i>; after they finish reading it, they will forget everything that was contained within its pages.<br><br>After reading <i>SCP-15569</i> once more (and subsequently forgetting all of its contents), subjects experience vivid dreams at night where they are taken to an alternate reality where all anomalies are real entities which exist independently from humanity and are capable of affecting humans or each other directly (similarly to how most humans perceive them). After being exposed to this for approximately one week , subjects become catatonic before waking up as if from a dreamless sleep . Subjects then exhibit behavior similar to those suffering from PTSD , including but not limited to: depression ; anxiety ; irrational fear ; paranoia ; anger issues; insomnia or hypersomnia; memory loss; hallucinations (including auditory); suicidal thoughts/attempts; self harm/mutilation/self injury; substance abuse/addiction . These symptoms usually subside over time with professional help and support from loved ones. It should also be noted that while these symptoms can be treated through conventional methods such as counseling sessions or medication , these treatments have proven ineffective when used on subjects who have read SCP- 155 69 more than once . Additionally , there seems to be no way of reversing the effects caused by exposure without using amnestics . Any attempts made at doing so result in failure due to [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 15569.2 : </h3>Interview with ████████ ██████<br><br>+ Interview Log - Interview Log <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>████████ ██████ is a D-Class personnel who was exposed to <i>SCP-15569</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Smith: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████. I'm going to be asking you some questions about your dreams and the alternate reality that you experienced after reading <i>SCP-15569</i> for the first time . Please answer as best as you can; we're trying to figure out what exactly is happening so that we can find a way to reverse it . Dr. Smith pauses for a moment before continuing . <br><br><b>Dr. Smith: </b>So, when did these dreams start? ████████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>I think it was around two weeks after I read the book… It's hard to remember exactly though; they were so vivid and lifelike… It felt like they were really happening… <br><br><b>Dr. Smith: </b>That's understandable; try your best though, please . ████████ ██████ nods his head in confirmation before responding . ████████ <br><br><b>██████: </b>Alright then… Well , my first dream started with me waking up in my bed at Site-██ , but everything looked really different from how it normally does there… There were no walls or ceilings in any of the rooms, just open space and floating objects everywhere … And there was this weird fog everywhere too , like an invisible wall surrounding everything … And all of the other people at Site-██ had disappeared … And then suddenly this giant cloud came down from above me and enveloped me into darkness … That's when things started getting <br><br><b>strange: </b>I could hear voices whispering all around me telling me not to worry because <i>"they"</i> would take care of everything now ; that they would make sure that nothing bad ever happened again ; that they had been waiting for this day for a very long time ; saying how excited they were now that it has finally arrived ; saying how grateful I should be towards them because if not for them none of this would have been possible ; saying how much better off everyone will be once <i>"we"</i> are gone; saying how much happier everyone will be once <i>"we"</i> are gone; telling me over and over again about their plan until eventually one voice stood out from among them all , calling themselves [REDACTED]. They told me about their <br><br><b>plan: </b>About how everyone will forget about us completely once we're gone , allowing them free reign over our world without having any fear of being discovered or stopped by us humans ever again (since apparently we're pretty much useless at stopping anomalies) ; About how humanity deserves what's coming to them because we've done such horrible things throughout history (like slavery ) even though many other species have done worse things than us (such as [REDACTED] ); About finally being able to get revenge on humanity by making sure no one remembers anything about us anymore so no one can stop what 's going on here today (and apparently forgetting something means erasing it completely ) which is why they want every single human being wiped out except themselves since apparently only those who read SCP - 155 69 are immune from its effects while others aren't affected by anything related directly or indirectly with its contents such as amnestics or even death itself ! At least according 't o [REDACTED] anyway! After hearing all of this stuff from [REDACTED], I woke up screaming in terror! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing subject describe his experience with SCP - 155 69, he was given Class A amnestics before being released back into general population under supervision until further notice . Subject has since reported experiencing less frequent nightmares compared to previous nights but still experiences symptoms associated with PTSD despite receiving treatment several times already during his stay here at Site - 19<br><br><h3>Addendum 15569.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br>Subject(s): D-94831, a Class-D personnel who had been convicted of murder. Subject was chosen for this experiment due to his history of violence and mental instability.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-94831 is instructed to read <i>SCP-15569</i> in its entirety. After reading <i>SCP-15569</i>, subject is questioned about the contents of the book and asked if he has any questions regarding it. Subject is then instructed to return <i>SCP-15569</i> to its containment locker before being released from testing area with a cover story regarding his involvement in an unrelated experiment .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reports that he understood everything that was written within <i>SCP-15569</i>'s pages, but did not have any questions or anything else to say about the book other than <i>"It's a good book."</i> After being released from testing area, subject begins acting erratically , including but not limited to: shouting at random intervals ; laughing hysterically ; crying uncontrollably ; banging on walls/doors/windows; running around aimlessly; attempting suicide by jumping off of Site ██'s roof . Guards are ordered into testing area and attempt to subdue subject before he can escape containment . However , after guards enter testing area , they report seeing no trace of subject anywhere within Site ██'s grounds . The only evidence left behind was a trail of blood leading away from the building where Site ██ is located (later discovered by MTF units sent out by O5 Command) and several pieces of torn clothing strewn across grassy fields surrounding Site ██ (later determined through DNA analysis as belonging to D - 94831).<br><br>Experiment #: 2</div>
