Upon waking, the subject will have no memory of the event and will be unable to recall any details about <i>SCP-15504</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-15504</i> was discovered in a club in [REDACTED], after several people were reported to have passed out while laughing uncontrollably. The club was evacuated and all affected subjects were administered Class A amnestics. The source of <i>SCP-15504</i> was traced back to an industrial sized tank containing 2,000 liters of pure helium under pressure. The tank had been installed by an unknown party 5 months prior, with an airlock built into the floor directly above it at one end of the club's dancefloor . Investigation revealed that all records pertaining to this installation had been deleted from local government databases and there were no records indicating who ordered or paid for it or why they would do so.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15504.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, owner of the club where <i>SCP-15504</i> was discovered.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Agent █████████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Hello Mr. ███████, thank you for coming in today. We just need to ask you a few questions about the industrial sized tank that was installed in your club five months ago. █████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>Oh right, that thing! Yeah I remember it now, it was weird as hell! Some guy came into my office one day and told me he wanted to install some sort of airlock on my dancefloor with a giant tank underneath it. He said he had all the permits and everything so I agreed to let him do it but I didn't like how secretive he was about what he wanted it for or who he worked for or anything like that… Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Did you ever find out? █████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>No… when we were done installing the tank this other guy showed up in an unmarked van and took the whole thing away before we could even get a look at what was inside… damnit now I really want to know! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview <i>SCP-15504</i> has been reclassified as Euclid until further information is obtained regarding its origin or purpose .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15504.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15504-1: </b>D-7461 is instructed to approach the tank and remove the lid.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-7461 is unable to remove the lid, and begins laughing uncontrollably. After 10 minutes, D-7461 loses consciousness. Upon waking, D-7461 reports feeling <i>"really happy"</i>.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15504-2: </b>A remote controlled robotic arm is used to remove the lid of the tank.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The robotic arm approaches <i>SCP-15504</i> and begins removing its lid. After approximately 5 minutes, it loses control of its movements and falls over with a loud clang . The robotic arm remains immobile for several hours before being remotely shut down by Dr ██████ . Upon inspection there are no visible signs of damage or any other abnormalities apart from a small amount of helium gas that has leaked out from around one of its joints.<br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15504-3: </b>A pressure gauge attached to an airlock is used in an attempt to measure how high <i>SCP-15504</i>'s pressure has risen since containment began (approximately 3 months prior). The pressure gauge fails after approximately 2 seconds due to excessive force applied by <i>SCP-15504</i> on it's faceplate.<br><br></div>
