When viewed through the mirror, the world appears to be slightly different than reality; small changes such as alterations to architecture, clothing styles, and even the presence of anomalous entities can be observed.<br><br>When an individual looks into <i>SCP-24953</i> for more than three minutes at a time, they will experience an extreme sense of vertigo and disorientation as their senses become overwhelmed by the altered reality presented in the mirror's reflection. After this period of time has elapsed, they will find themselves suddenly transported into this alternate version of reality without any prior warning or recollection of how it happened.<br><br>The only known way to return from this alternate universe is by looking back into <i>SCP-24953</i>'s reflection for at least three minutes again; upon doing so, individuals will find themselves back in their original world with no memory or knowledge of what transpired during their stay in the other realm. It should also be noted that any objects brought along while entering this alternate universe are not returned upon exiting it through <i>SCP-24953</i>'s reflection.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-24953</i> is to be kept in a secure containment chamber at all times, with two guards posted outside the entrance.

If any individual begins to experience symptoms of vertigo or disorientation while inside the chamber, they are to immediately leave and report their findings to a supervisor. Under no circumstances should anyone attempt to enter this alternate universe through <i>SCP-24953</i>'s reflection without proper authorization from command staff.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24953.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a research team was sent into the alternate universe through <i>SCP-24953</i>'s reflection in order to investigate its properties and inhabitants. After three hours of exploration, the team reported that they had encountered several humanoid entities with anomalous abilities as well as multiple locations which seemed to be of extra-dimensional origin. They were also able to collect various artifacts from this other realm for further study.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24953.2: </h3> Interview with D-45892<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> D-45892<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Can you tell me what happened when you looked into <i>SCP-24953</i>? <br><b>D-45892:</b> Well, I remember looking in the mirror and feeling a strange sensation come over me. Then all of a sudden I was somewhere else; it looked like my world but different. There were people walking around wearing clothes that weren't from my time period, and some of them even had wings! It was really weird…<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Did you experience any other strange phenomena while in this alternate universe? <br><b>D-45892:</b> Yeah, there were some weird creatures that kept following me around and they seemed to be able to talk. They said something about wanting to show me something, but I didn't understand what they meant. Then I heard a voice telling me it was time to go back and suddenly I was back in the containment chamber again.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24953.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 24953-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, D-Class personnel were instructed to enter <i>SCP-24953</i>'s alternate universe and observe the changes present in it. Upon entering, they reported seeing a variety of anomalous entities, including humanoid figures with wings and what appeared to be a large dragon flying overhead. After three minutes had elapsed, all personnel were safely returned to their original world without any memory or knowledge of what transpired during their stay in the other realm.</div>
