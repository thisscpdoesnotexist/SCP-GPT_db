The next thing I know is that he poured it on me and left without paying or even ordering anything! But then, something strange happened… The gravy turned into blood! And then it disappeared into thin air! That's when my body started to feel weird… Like there were millions of cells inside me trying to take over my body! My eyes turned black as night and my skin turned pale white like snow! Then all of the sudden everything went back to normal but now there were 2 people standing where there was only 1 before! Then they both vanished into thin air right in front of me!! After that, I woke up in this room with no recollection what had happened after that day until now!! That's when you walked in here!! Please help me!!!<br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15262.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15262 (D-Class)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15262 will enter the room with <i>SCP-15262</i>. Once he is in the room, he will sit down until told to do something else. After 30 minutes, he will be removed from the room and questioned about his experience. The following is a transcript of the interview.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>Dr.: Hello, D-15262? How are you doing?<br><br>D.: I'm fine… What's this cell thingy? It looks like a normal gravy… Are you sure it's safe to eat?<br><br>Dr.: Yes, yes it is! Now please sit down on that chair over there and wait for me to tell you what to do next! [D-15262 sits down on one of the chairs.] Good! Now we're going to test out this cell thingy here for a few minutes before we give it to our boss as a gift! [He takes out his phone and starts recording.] Alright now I'm going to tell you what happens when someone touches this gravy here so pay attention! [He takes <i>SCP-15262</i> off of its plate and holds it up above his head.] If anyone touches this gravy then they get turned into blood forever or vanish into nothingness depending on how much they touch it at once! So don't touch any part of this gravy or else bad things might happen okay!? [<i>SCP-15262</i> begins glowing red.] Oh wait I forgot something… Don't move while I hold onto SCP 1526 2 because if you move then bad things might happen too okay!? [SCP 1526 2 continues glowing red until Dr ██████ puts it back onto its plate.] Okay now that that's done let me see your hand real quick so we can start testing out some stuff alright!? That's good just leave your hand there for now… Mmm hmmm good job not moving!! You're doing great!! Okay now let me see your other hand real quick!! There we go!! Now let me put some more stuff in front of your hands just in case okay!? There we go!! Good job again not moving while my back was turned!!! You're really smart aren't ya?! Alright now let me put some more stuff in front of your hands again just in case because if you move then bad things might happen alright!? Mmm hmmm good job not moving while my back was turned!!! You're really smart aren't ya?! Alright now I'm gonna ask questions about what happened when my back was turned ok?? So pay attention!!!! And remember don't move even an inch or else bad things might happen!!! Okay ready?? Here goes nothing….What did you see when my back was turned??? Did anything weird happen??? Did anything change colors??? Did anything disappear or appear??? Anything like that at all???? No????? Nothing at all happened huh???? Well thanks for being honest with me anyway!!! That means no one touched any part of this gravy here which means no one got vanished into thin air or turn into blood forever!!!!! So thank god everyone didn't die today!!!!! Yayyyyyyy!!!! Ok well since everything went fine today without anyone dying then I guess everything went pretty well today right?? Well thanks again for helping us test out our new cell thingy here so hopefully everything goes nice and smooth tomorrow too without anyone dying ok?! Bye bye~</div>
