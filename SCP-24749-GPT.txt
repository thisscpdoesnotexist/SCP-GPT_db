<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-24749 is  a room where your shadow takes over you</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-24749<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-24749</i> is a room of dimensions 4m x 4m x 3m located in an abandoned warehouse in [REDACTED], USA. The walls, floor and ceiling are painted black and the only source of light is provided by a single candle placed in the center of the room.<br><br>When a subject enters <i>SCP-24749</i>, their shadow will begin to move independently from them, growing progressively larger until it completely envelops them. Once this occurs, all physical contact with the subject will be lost as they become seemingly incorporeal. Subjects have been observed to be able to manipulate objects within <i>SCP-24749</i> through unknown means but cannot interact with anything outside of it.<br><br>The only known way to release subjects from <i>SCP-24749</i> is by extinguishing the candle within it; upon doing so, all subjects affected by its anomalous properties will return to normal immediately. However, once extinguished the candle cannot be relit and must instead be replaced with another one identical in size and shape before any further testing can take place.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-24749</i> is to be contained in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. Access to the room must be restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher and all testing must take place under the supervision of at least two (2) personnel.<br><br>Any subjects affected by <i>SCP-24749</i>'s anomalous properties are to be monitored closely until released from its effects. Any attempts to relight the candle within <i>SCP-24749</i> are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24749.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-24749</i> on non-human subjects. A common house cat (Felis catus) was placed in <i>SCP-24749</i> and its shadow began to grow as expected. However, when the candle was extinguished, the subject did not return to normal and instead remained incorporeal. Further testing is required to determine if this effect is unique to felines or applies to all non-human species.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24749.2: </h3> Interview with D-72498<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-72498, a subject affected by <i>SCP-24749</i>'s anomalous properties.<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> D-72498 was asked to describe their experience within <i>SCP-24749</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me what happened when you entered the room?<br><b><br>D-72498:</b> It was like I had no control over my body anymore. I could still see and hear, but it felt like my shadow was controlling me instead of me controlling it. It seemed to be growing bigger and bigger until it completely enveloped me and then everything went black. The next thing I remember is being released from the room after the candle was extinguished.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Did you experience anything else while inside?<br><b><br>D-72498:</b> Yeah, I could feel something moving around me in the darkness. It was like a presence, but I couldn't see it or make out what it was. It seemed to be watching me and whispering things, but I couldn't understand what it was saying.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> D-72498 was released from <i>SCP-24749</i>'s effects and debriefed. No further information was gained.<br><br><h3> Addendum 24749.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>The following experiments were conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-24749</i> on its subjects. All tests were performed under the supervision of two (2) personnel and recorded by a third.<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> D-93445 was instructed to enter <i>SCP-24749</i> and was observed for five (5) minutes before being released upon extinguishing the candle. Upon release, D-93445 reported feeling as if time had passed more quickly than it should have while inside <i>SCP-24749</i>, though no physical changes in their appearance or behavior were observed.</div>
