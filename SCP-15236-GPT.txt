Once possessed, the subject will begin to exhibit symptoms consistent with schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder.<br><br><i>SCP-15236</i>'s primary anomalous effect manifests when it possesses an individual who has previously been affected by SCP-████ (hereafter referred to as SCP-█████). Upon doing so, <i>SCP-15236</i> will manifest within the mind of any individuals currently affected by SCP-█████ (hereafter referred to as SCP-█████'s) in addition to those already under its control. The number of additional instances of itself that appear varies from one instance to another; however, each instance appears in a different location within the mindscape created by SCP-█████'s primary anomaly. Despite this difference in location, all instances are visible and audible to each other at all times. These additional instances are not hostile towards one another or towards other individuals who have been possessed by 15236; however they do not appear aware that they are manifestations of 15236 rather than independent entities present within the same mindscape as them.<br><br>SCP 15236 was discovered on █/██/20██ when multiple reports were filed regarding a series of murders committed throughout ████████████ County, Florida . According to eyewitness accounts , victims were found with their eyes removed and replaced with photographs depicting various locations around the county . It was later determined that these photographs had been taken from different camera phones belonging to civilians living within ████████████ County . Foundation personnel embedded in local law enforcement agencies traced these phone numbers back until they reached an individual named <i>"Barry Thomas"</i> , whose phone had also taken several pictures around town during the time period where most murders took place . When questioned about his involvement , Mr Thomas denied taking any pictures but expressed interest in photography . Mr Thomas was administered Class A amnestics prior [DATA EXPUNGED] after Dr Ayers realized that he may be able find more information about Barry's connection with 15236 if he could locate him again . After locating him again , Dr Ayers approached Mr Thomas while wearing an eyepatch over his left eye and asked if he would be willing take some pictures for him while wearing it so he could learn how it felt ; Mr Thomas agreed without hesitation due to his interest in photography [REDACTED] Dr Ayers has since retired from field work due [<br><br><h3>Addendum 15236.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 15236.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15236</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Ayers </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Ayers: </b>Good afternoon, <i>SCP-15236</i>. <br><br><b><i>SCP-15236</i>: </b>Hi! <br><br><b>Dr. Ayers: </b>I'm going to be asking you a few questions today, if that's alright with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-15236</i>: </b>Sure!

It wasn't too bad at first but then it got worse and worse until finally nobody would talk to me anymore .
