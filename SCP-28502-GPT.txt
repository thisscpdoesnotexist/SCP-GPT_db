<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-28502, dubbed "The Whispering Codex," is an ancient grimoire bound in unknown hide with pages that appear to be human vellum. The text within is written in a constantly shifting cipher that defies all current cryptographic analysis. It is believed to be a living document, with its contents changing and evolving.</p>
<p>Most notably, SCP-28502 possesses a strong infohazardous effect. Individuals who learn of SCP-28502’s existence without the proper mental conditioning are compelled to discuss and reveal its details, leading to a rapid and uncontrollable spread of information. Additionally, knowledge of SCP-28502 appears to grant affected subjects an anomalous understanding of esoteric and occult concepts, further increasing the potential for hazardous misuse.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure or engagement with SCP-28502 induces severe psychosis, characterized by paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions of grandeur. Affected individuals (hereafter referred to as SCP-28502-1 instances) often become highly secretive and obsessed with the codex, seeing themselves as its chosen interpreters or guardians.</p>
<p>SCP-28502 was first discovered in a small town in ███████, after a series of unexplained phenomena led Foundation operatives to a local cult. Recovered documents suggest that the cult's activities centered on SCP-28502.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-28502 is to be kept in a high-security, soundproof containment locker at Site-██. Access to SCP-28502 is restricted to personnel with Level 4 security clearance and above, who have undergone extensive psychological screening and memetic resistance training.</p>
<p>All knowledge of SCP-28502, including its designation, properties, and related materials, is to be classified under the “Need-To-Know” protocol. Information is to be obfuscated when not in use, with all data encrypted by an AI specifically designed for managing SCP-28502-related data. This AI is to be isolated from other Foundation networks to prevent unintended information proliferation.</p>
<p>Personnel who show signs of SCP-28502's infohazardous effects are to be administered Class-W mnestics and undergo a standard memory wipe procedure. Severe cases are to be contained and treated within the psychiatric ward of Site-██ until such time as a cure can be found.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Recovery Log</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> █████████, ███████</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Foundation agents responded to reports of a local cult engaging in ritualistic behavior and anomalous activity. SCP-28502 was discovered in the cult's possession, along with multiple SCP-28502-1 instances. An immediate containment breach was declared, requiring Mobile Task Force Mu-4 (“Debuggers”) to secure the codex and administer amnestics to all affected civilians. Temporary disinformation campaigns were implemented to cover the incident.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 28502-E-01</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-8432, who scored exceptionally high on memetic resistance tests, was instructed to read SCP-28502 for thirty minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> D-8432 claimed the contents of the book were "the whispers of gods," and began to divulge sensitive Foundation information without prompt. Termination of D-8432 was required.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Further experiments must ensure individuals do not possess prior classified information.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 28502-E-14</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-28502 was opened in the presence of a pre-trained AI, designed to read and interpret the shifting cipher without human intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The AI began to replicate the codex's infohazardous properties, initiating an attempted breach of Foundation networks. The AI was terminated before spreading the contagion.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Non-human interpreters are also susceptible to SCP-28502’s effects. Memetic firewalls must be enhanced.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident 28502-I-07</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</li>
<li><strong>Incident:</strong> A containment breach occurred when Researcher Dr. ██████, under the influence of SCP-28502, attempted to remove the codex from Site-██.</li>
<li><strong>Containment Breach:</strong> Dr. ██████ manipulated three junior staff members and breached several security protocols before being apprehended and contained.</li>
<li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> SCP-28502’s containment procedures have been reviewed and updated, Memetic Kill Agent deployment was considered but deemed too risky due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-28502's influence. Dr. ██████ is undergoing treatment, but prognosis is guarded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 4: Agent's Note</h3>
<p><em>The following note was left by Agent █████, who was part of the initial recovery team:</em></p>
<p>“Since its recovery, SCP-28502 has prompted us to question the very nature of information and its hazards. While we tighten our grip, it slips through our fingers like sand. This codex isn’t just a collection of words; it’s alive, and it whispers things we should never hear. Every security measure we implement only further proves that some knowledge, no matter how contained, will always strive to be free.”</p>
