The base is inhabited by an unknown number of sentient teddy bears, which are believed to be sapient and possess advanced technology.<br><br>The teddy bears are equipped with weapons such as laser rifles and energy shields, and appear to have access to some form of teleportation technology. They also appear to possess knowledge of several languages, including English and Russian. Attempts at communication have been unsuccessful thus far due to their lack of verbal communication or written language.<br><br>The teddy bears are hostile towards any intruders that enter their territory, attacking them with extreme prejudice if they do not leave immediately upon detection. Any attempts at negotiation or peaceful contact have thus far failed; all attempts at breaching the perimeter defenses have resulted in heavy casualties among personnel involved in such operations.<br><br>Despite numerous attempts by Foundation personnel over many years, no further information has been obtained regarding <i>SCP-19834</i> or its inhabitants beyond what has already been observed through reconnaissance missions conducted using unmanned probes sent from Earth orbit.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the hostile nature of the teddy bears inhabiting <i>SCP-19834</i>, no personnel are to be sent within a ██ kilometer radius of the base. Any attempts at communication or negotiation with the inhabitants are strictly forbidden.<br><br>Any unauthorized probes or vessels attempting to approach <i>SCP-19834</i> will be intercepted and destroyed by Foundation forces stationed in Earth orbit. All information regarding <i>SCP-19834</i> is restricted from public access and dissemination.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19834.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an unmanned probe sent from Earth orbit was intercepted and destroyed by the teddy bears inhabiting <i>SCP-19834</i>. Analysis of debris recovered from the crash site revealed that the probe had been equipped with a camera and audio recorder, both of which were still functioning upon impact.<br><br>The footage recorded by the probe showed several teddy bears operating various pieces of equipment within what appeared to be a control room. The audio recording contained snippets of conversation between two or more individuals in English, although no further information could be gleaned due to heavy interference present on the recording.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19834.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><br>Dr. ████, a Foundation researcher assigned to <i>SCP-19834</i>, was interviewed regarding the teddy bears inhabiting the base.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> So, Dr. ████, what can you tell us about the teddy bears inhabiting <i>SCP-19834</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Well, for starters, they're extremely hostile and dangerous. They seem to possess some form of advanced technology that allows them to detect intruders from a distance and launch an immediate counterattack. They also appear to be highly intelligent; they understand basic commands in English and Russian, though they don't respond verbally or with written language. We've yet to make any progress in terms of communication or negotiation with them; all attempts have failed thus far.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Are there any other details you can provide?<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Not really, no. We've been unable to get close enough to the base to observe it in detail, and our probes have only managed to detect a few of its features from afar. All we know is that it's heavily defended and inhabited by these teddy bears, who seem determined to keep anyone from entering or leaving their territory.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19834.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 19834-1:</b> On ██/██/████, a Foundation probe was sent to <i>SCP-19834</i> in an attempt to establish communication with the teddy bears. The probe was equipped with several audio and visual recording devices, as well as a translation device capable of translating English into several other languages.<br><br>Upon arrival at the base, the teddy bears immediately opened fire on the probe, destroying it within seconds. No further attempts have been made since then due to the hostile nature of the inhabitants.</div>
