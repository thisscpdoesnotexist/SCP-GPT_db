<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21486 is  the beach that makes you fold</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21486<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21486</i> is an anomalous beach located in ████████, Florida. It appears to be a normal beach with white sand and clear blue water. However, anyone who visits the beach will find themselves unable to leave it.<br><br>When someone attempts to exit the beach, they will experience an extreme sensation of folding or being folded up into a small space, similar to origami paper folding. This sensation will last for several seconds before the person finds themselves back on the beach again with no memory of what happened during that time period.<br><br>Attempts at leaving by any means other than walking have been unsuccessful as well; vehicles and boats simply stop working when approaching the perimeter of <i>SCP-21486</i> and cannot be restarted until they are taken away from it again. The only way out is by walking out of its boundaries while avoiding contact with any part of its surface or objects on it.<br><br>It has been theorized that this anomaly may be related to some kind of extradimensional space but further investigation is needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21486</i> is to be monitored by a team of researchers at all times. Access to the beach is restricted and any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter it must be detained and questioned.<br><br>Any objects found on or around <i>SCP-21486</i> are to be collected for further study. Any attempts at leaving the beach must be documented and reported immediately.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21486.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to leave the beach by walking. As they reached the edge of the beach, they were suddenly enveloped in a bright light and disappeared for several minutes before reappearing back on the beach with no memory of what had happened during that time period.<br><br>Further investigation is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21486.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Subject ████, a tourist who visited <i>SCP-21486</i>. Interviewer: Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me what happened when you tried to leave the beach?<br><b><br>Subject ████:</b> Well, I was walking towards the exit and suddenly I felt like I was being folded up into a tiny space. It was really weird and uncomfortable but then it stopped and I found myself back on the beach again with no memory of what had just happened.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you remember anything else from that experience?<br><b><br>Subject ████:</b> No, nothing at all. It was like it never happened.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21486.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment Log 1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-214867<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to walk out of the beach.<br><b><br>Results:</b> Subject experienced a sensation of folding and then found themselves back on the beach again with no memory of what happened during that time period.</div>
