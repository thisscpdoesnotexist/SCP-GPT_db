<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19877 is  the armoire of invincibility</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19877<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19877</i> is a large wooden armoire, approximately 2.5 meters tall and 1.8 meters wide. The exterior of the armoire appears to be made out of an unknown type of wood, with no visible markings or decorations on it.<br><br>When opened, the interior of <i>SCP-19877</i> contains a variety of items that appear to have been chosen at random from various locations around the world. These include weapons (ranging from swords and spears to firearms), armor (from plate mail to powered exoskeletons), tools (including medical supplies, computers and communication devices) as well as foodstuffs and other mundane objects such as clothing.<br><br>The anomalous properties of <i>SCP-19877</i> become apparent when any item contained within it is removed from its interior; upon removal, the item becomes completely invulnerable to all forms of physical damage or destruction for an indefinite period until returned inside <i>SCP-19877</i>’s interior again. This includes both kinetic energy based attacks (such as bullets or explosives) as well as magical or supernatural sources - even those which would normally bypass conventional defenses such as antimagic fields are ineffective against these items while they are outside the armoire's interior space. Additionally, any item placed inside <i>SCP-19877</i> will gain these properties upon removal regardless if it had them before being placed in there; this effect does not extend beyond what can fit into its confines however - for example attempting to place a vehicle inside will fail due to size restrictions without exception despite being able to store individual components in there successfully otherwise).<br><br>Furthermore any object stored within <i>SCP-19877</i> has been observed becoming increasingly resistant towards attempts at manipulation by external forces over time; this includes attempts at remote control via technological means such as computer systems or radio signals but also more esoteric methods like telepathy or mind control effects used by sapient entities alike - although some form of manipulation may still be possible depending on how powerful said effect is compared against the increasing resistance provided by this anomaly over time spent outside its confines).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19877</i> is to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-███. Access to the armoire is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher, and any items removed from it must be immediately returned upon completion of testing or experimentation. Any attempts at manipulating objects contained within <i>SCP-19877</i> are strictly forbidden without prior approval from the Site Director.<br><br>In order to prevent potential misuse of its anomalous properties, all personnel entering the containment area are required to submit themselves for a full psychological evaluation before being allowed access. Additionally, any personnel found attempting unauthorized manipulation of objects contained within <i>SCP-19877</i> will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination depending on severity of infraction.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19877.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a group of personnel attempted to use <i>SCP-19877</i> in order to create an impenetrable fortress. The attempt was unsuccessful due to the increasing resistance of objects contained within the armoire when removed from its interior. After several hours of attempting various methods and strategies, it was determined that any attempts at using <i>SCP-19877</i> for such purposes were futile and all personnel involved were reprimanded accordingly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19877.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████, can you tell us what your research into <i>SCP-19877</i> has revealed?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Well, my team and I have been studying the armoire for some time now and we've come to the conclusion that it is a powerful artifact of unknown origin. We believe that whoever created it did so with the intent of providing an impenetrable defense against any form of attack or manipulation - physical, magical or otherwise - which explains why its contents become invulnerable when removed from its interior space. We also believe that the armoire was designed to be used as a form of mobile fortress, allowing its user to move around with an impenetrable defense while still having access to all the necessary items they might need in a given situation.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19877.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 19877-A:</b> A standard issue ballistic vest was placed inside <i>SCP-19877</i>’s interior and then removed. Upon removal, the vest became completely invulnerable to all forms of damage, including kinetic energy based attacks such as bullets or explosives.</div>
