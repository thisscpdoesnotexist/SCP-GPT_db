Further investigation revealed that the bullet had passed through the small intestine and out of the body. The bullet was recovered from Agent ████████'s body and identified as a standard issue 9mm Parabellum round. The source of this round has yet to be determined, as no firearm was found on or near Agent ████████ at the time of discovery.<br><br>Agent ████████ is currently being held under quarantine while <i>SCP-15440</i> is being studied by Foundation researchers to determine its origin and effects on human physiology. At this time, it has been determined that <i>SCP-15440</i> causes no ill effects on human health other than minor discomfort when present in a person's abdomen for extended periods of time (see Addendum 15440a). It should be noted that the presence or absence of <i>SCP-15440</i> does not appear to affect any other bodily functions aside from digestion; for example, if <i>SCP-15440</i> were removed from someone's stomach, they would still digest food normally even though there would be nothing left inside them to digest said food with. This effect appears limited only to digestion; all other bodily processes are unaffected by its presence or absence (see Experiment Log 15440b).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15440.1 : </h3>???????????????<br><br><h3>Addendum 15440.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????????????<br><br><h3>Addendum 15440.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15440-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15440 (male, 26 years old)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15440 is to ingest a meal of his choosing. <i>SCP-15440</i> is then to be removed from his stomach using standard surgical tools and placed on a table in front of him. Once the procedure is complete, the subject will be instructed to describe any changes he notices in his body. Subject was given no information about <i>SCP-15440</i> prior to this experiment.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon completion of the procedure, subject reported feeling as if something were missing inside him; however, all other bodily functions appeared normal aside from digestion. Subject was instructed to consume a meal consisting primarily of protein and carbohydrates; after consuming said meal, subject reported that he felt <i>"fuller"</i> than usual but otherwise did not notice any other changes in bodily function or discomfort due to lack of food consumption for an extended period of time (see Experiment 15440b).<br><br>Experiment 15440b:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-15439 (male, 23 years old) and D-15438 (female, 22 years old) are both healthy individuals with no history or known medical conditions that would affect their digestive systems or stomachs in any way. Both subjects were given no information about <i>SCP-15440</i> prior to this experiment except for its designation as an anomalous object under Foundation containment procedures. Subjects were told that they had been selected for testing due to their similar heights and weights with Agent ████████ — who has been confirmed by researchers as being approximately 1 m 70 cm tall — so that they could help determine how much food Agent ████████ should be fed each day while under quarantine by comparing their own experiences with those described by Agent ████████ during Experiment 15440a . Both subjects agreed willingly upon being informed that they would receive extra rations if they participated in the test properly . Subjects are also aware that said rations may decrease depending on how well they perform during this test .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>As per Experiment 15430a , both subjects ingested meals consisting primarily of protein and carbohydrates before undergoing surgery wherein <i>SCP-15440</i> was removed from their respective stomachs using standard surgical tools; both subjects required local anesthesia before undergoing surgery so as not cause undue stress on themselves while performing it . After surgery was completed successfully without incident , both subjects were asked whether anything had changed inside them after having undergone surgery ; results are summarized below:<br><br>D - 1 4 4 3 8: <i>" I feel like I just ate two full meals instead o' one , but otherwise I'm fine ."</i> Interviewer's <br><br><b>note: </b>Subject did not appear distressed at all despite having undergone invasive abdominal surgery earlier ; interview concluded shortly thereafter without incident .<br><br>D - 1 4 4 3 9: <i>" I don't feel hungry anymore ? It's weird , because I know we just ate dinner but now it feels like hours ago ? But at the same time it feels like my body knows there's still food inside me even though my brain doesn't ? It's hard t' explain ."</i> Interviewer's <br><br><b>note: </b>Subject appeared somewhat distressed throughout interview ; she seemed particularly uncomfortable when describing her experience after eating dinner despite having eaten less than half an hour beforehand . Despite these observations however , she did not request additional painkillers or sedatives during interview ; interview concluded shortly thereafter without incident .</div>
