It has a black body and wings, with white spots on its chest and face. <i>SCP-10034</i> has been seen flying in the air at an altitude of around 3 kilometers above sea level.<br><br><i>SCP-10034</i>'s primary anomalous property manifests when it flies past any human being below it at an altitude lower than 3 kilometers (<i>SCP-10034</i> will fly down to 1 kilometer before flying back up). When this happens, any human who sees <i>SCP-10034</i> will be inflicted by what appears to be a curse transmitted through eye contact . The affected humans will then begin worshiping <i>SCP-10034</i> as their god , and refer to themselves as <i>"Yig's Children"</i>, or simply <i>"Children"</i>. Some subjects have also reported seeing other humanoid figures during these times (see Addendum 1003 for further details).<br><br>+ Show Interview Log 1003 - Hide Interview Log 1003 <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-[REDACTED] </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-[REDACTED] was one of the first victims of The Curse Of Yig . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello there, I'm here to ask you some questions about your current situation. <br><br><b>D-[REDACTED]: </b>Okay… Dr.: First off, how do you feel right now?

This has led researchers to believe that the effects are not caused by <i>SCP-10034</i> itself, but by something else present in its vicinity . It is also worth noting that the subjects who are affected by The Curse Of Yig do not worship other non-euclidean bats (e.g., Pteropus vampyrus) , despite having seen them flying past them at an altitude lower than 3 kilometers .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10034.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br>+ Show Interview Log 10034 - Hide Interview Log 10034 <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-[REDACTED] </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-[REDACTED] was one of the first victims of The Curse Of Yig . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello there, I'm here to ask you some questions about your current situation. <br><br><b>D-[REDACTED]: </b>Hello sir!

A video camera is to be placed inside the room, facing towards D-[REDACTED]. This video camera is then connected to a monitor outside the room, which displays what it sees. The monitor will also display an image of <i>SCP-10034</i> flying past D-[REDACTED]. The experiment will then proceed for 10 minutes . After this time has elapsed, the experiment will end and D-[REDACTED] will be given Class A Amnestics . <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello there, I'm here to ask you some questions about your current situation.

However , it seems as though those who are infected by seeing <i>SCP-10034</i> directly are more susceptible than those who have only seen images of it . It would appear as though direct eye contact with <i>SCP-10034</i> causes its effects on humans easier than indirect eye contact does. -Dr. ████</div>
