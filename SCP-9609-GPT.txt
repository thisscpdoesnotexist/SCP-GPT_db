The colors are always changing in a random order as long as the entity is alive and awake.<br><br>When <i>SCP-9609</i> awakens, its colors will change at all times until it goes back to sleep or dies. This cube entity has been found in the basement room of an abandoned house located at ██████████ street in ██████████████ city by Agent ████████ while investigating reports about missing persons cases nearby and unusual sounds coming from inside the building after midnight (see addendum #1).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> Agent ████████ found out that people who went missing were in fact abducted by humanoids (possibly aliens) and placed inside <i>SCP-9609</i> when they were asleep or unconscious. The abductors used the basement of the home as a bait for their traps. When Agent ████████ opened <i>SCP-9609</i> with the help of a thermal lance, he saw a group of humanoids fighting each other and trying to force another humanoid into <i>SCP-9609</i> from outside, but before they succeeded, Agent ████████ closed it again and alerted the Foundation about his discovery.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9609.1 :</h3> The following is a transcript of the first interaction between Agent ████████ and <i>SCP-9609</i>.<br><br><Begin Log><br> Agent ████████: This thing looks really weird. It's like a giant black cube with no openings or holes on it. I should try to open it, there is a possibility that someone might be trapped inside but alive, that would be great.<br><br>Agent ████████ uses his thermal lance and cuts an opening in the top corner of <i>SCP-9609</i> and peeks inside through the hole he made. After he saw what was inside, he dropped his thermal lance and ran away as fast as possible to avoid being abducted by the humanoids himself who were fighting each other for dominance over this new found technology (unfortunately Agent ████████ was captured by them). <End Log><br> Closing Statement: After hearing about this incident from Agent ████████ when it was being interrogated by Foundation personnel about its discovery, The Site Director sent Task Force Delta-6 (<i>"Damn Fools"</i>) to secure <i>SCP-9609</i> from these hostile humanoids before they could do any harm with their newly acquired technology (see addendum #2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9609.2 :</h3> The following is a transcript of the interaction between Dr. ██████ and <i>SCP-9609</i> after he opened it with help from Task Force Delta-6.</div>
