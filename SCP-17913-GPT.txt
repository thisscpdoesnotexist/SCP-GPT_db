<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17913 is  a wig made of numerous ears.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17913<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Euclid<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17913</i> is a wig composed of human ears, each measuring an average of 0.5 cm in length. All ears are connected to the base of the wig by a thin layer of flesh and cartilage. The number of ears composing <i>SCP-17913</i> varies; however, it has been observed to range from 500 to 1000 at any given time.<br><br>The source for the ears used in <i>SCP-17913</i> is unknown; however, all instances appear to be from different individuals and show no signs of decay or decomposition. While wearing <i>SCP-17913</i>, subjects report feeling a sense of heightened awareness and increased auditory sensitivity as well as an increase in their ability to detect subtle sounds or vibrations around them. This effect appears to extend beyond what would normally be expected from wearing a normal wig made out of hair or other material.<br><br>When removed from its wearer's head, <i>SCP-17913</i> will immediately begin searching for another host via unknown means; if none can be found within 24 hours it will return itself back onto its original wearer's head regardless if they are present or not at that time. Additionally, when worn by someone other than its original owner (designated Host A),<i>SCP-17913</i> will actively seek out Host A with the same vigor as it does for new hosts and attempt to return itself back onto their head once located even if forcibly removed beforehand by personnel attempting containment measures on it . <br><br>Due to these properties combined with its anomalous capabilities, containment protocols have been put into place requiring two personnel when handling <i>SCP-17913</i> during transport between sites or research facilities so that one person may keep watch over it while the other handles any necessary paperwork related tasks such as logging movement records etc…<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17913</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██ when not being used for testing or research purposes. All personnel handling <i>SCP-17913</i> must wear protective gloves and face masks to prevent accidental contact with the object.<br><br>When transporting <i>SCP-17913</i> between sites, two personnel are required to accompany it at all times; one person must remain within visual range of the object while the other handles any necessary paperwork related tasks such as logging movement records etc… Additionally, if Host A is present during transport they must be restrained and monitored closely by both accompanying personnel.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17913.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-17913</i> was worn by Host A during a routine testing session. During the course of the session, Host A reported feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and fear as if something was watching them from within the wig. When questioned about this sensation, Host A stated that they could hear voices whispering to them from inside <i>SCP-17913</i> and that these voices were attempting to convince them to do something unspecified. After approximately 10 minutes of exposure to these whispers, Host A requested that <i>SCP-17913</i> be removed from their head.<br><br>Afterwards no further instances of anomalous activity have been observed in relation to <i>SCP-17913</i> or its wearer's behavior; however, due to the potential risk associated with it personnel are reminded not to leave subjects exposed for long periods of time while wearing it and should take all necessary precautions when handling it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17913.2: </h3> Interview with Host A<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Host A (designated <i>SCP-17913</i>-1)<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Please state your name and age for the record.<br><b><br><i>SCP-17913</i>-1:</b> My name is [REDACTED], I'm 18 years old.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> How did you come to possess <i>SCP-17913</i>?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17913</i>-1:</b> It was a gift from my grandmother, she said it was an heirloom passed down through generations of our family but I never really knew what it was until now…<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you know why it behaves the way it does?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17913</i>-1:</b> No, I don't… I just know that when I wear it, I can hear things more clearly and that's all.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17913.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment Log-17913.3<br><b>Subject:</b> D-87314<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to put on <i>SCP-17913</i> and remain in a soundproof chamber for 30 minutes while wearing it. <br><b>Results:</b> During the experiment, subject reported feeling a heightened sense of awareness and increased auditory sensitivity as well as an increase in their ability to detect subtle sounds or vibrations around them. After the experiment concluded, subject reported feeling fatigued and that they had a headache but otherwise showed no adverse effects from wearing <i>SCP-17913</i>.</div>
