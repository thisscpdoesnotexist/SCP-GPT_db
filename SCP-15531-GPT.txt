It has no discernible facial features, with the exception of a mouth that opens vertically rather than horizontally.<br><br><i>SCP-15531</i>'s body is composed of an unknown material that emits light in the visible spectrum when exposed to air. This light appears to be generated by <i>SCP-15531</i>'s body itself; attempts at removing pieces of <i>SCP-15531</i> for study have resulted in these pieces emitting their own light, which quickly dims and then disappears after several minutes. When not exposed to air (such as when submerged in water), <i>SCP-15531</i> appears dark grey in coloration and does not emit any visible light.<br><br>When exposed to air, <i>SCP-15531</i> will often attempt to approach human beings , especially if they are alone or otherwise isolated from other people . Once it has approached within 2 meters of its target(s), it will begin emitting extremely bright white flashes of light from its mouth . These flashes are typically accompanied by loud noises similar to thunderclaps . The intensity and duration of these flashes increase with proximity; subjects who come within approximately 50 cm experience pain on their skin equivalent to being burned with hot iron rods , while those who come within 10 cm suffer third degree burns across their entire body . Subjects who have been subjected to this effect report feeling as though they were about one second away from death at all times while under attack by SCP- 15531 - usually due to heatstroke or severe blood loss - but were unable even [REDACTED] (see Addendum). During this time, subjects report hearing <i>"the voice"</i> , which they describe as being very loud but impossible for them understand what it was saying ; most subjects express feelings of extreme fear during this period due both the pain inflicted upon them and the sensation described above (see Interview Log 15531). After several minutes (typically between 5 and 15) these attacks cease abruptly; however, subject reports indicate that they continue experiencing pain even after SCP- 15531 ceases its <br><br><b>attack: </b>although lessened considerably compared with what was experienced during the initial attack(s) , this pain remains present until such time as medical attention is provided . In addition , subject reports indicate that even if medical attention is provided immediately following cessation of an attack by SCP - 15535 1 9 instances have been recorded where individuals died before receiving treatment for injuries sustained during an encounter with it ; autopsy results indicated that all such deaths were caused either directly or indirectly<br><br><h3>Addendum 15531.1 : </h3>【<i>SCP-15531</i> Interview Log】<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15531</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████, who had been informed of the nature of <i>SCP-15531</i>'s anomalous properties prior to conducting the interview. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, 15531!
