The website allows users to purchase mansions at prices much lower than their estimated market value. All transactions are done through cryptocurrency, and all mansions purchased through <i>SCP-18305</i> have been abandoned or foreclosed upon prior to being listed on the site.<br><br>When a user purchases a mansion from <i>SCP-18305</i>, they are given access to an online portal which provides detailed information about the property, including its exact location and any special features it may possess. Upon arrival at the property, they will find that it has been completely renovated and furnished with modern amenities. Additionally, all utilities are already connected and in working order.<br><br>The origin of these properties is unknown; however, no evidence suggests that any of them were acquired illegally or by nefarious means. It is also unclear how <i>SCP-18305</i> manages to acquire such properties for such low prices; however, due to its anomalous nature this phenomenon cannot be replicated by normal means.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Access to <i>SCP-18305</i> is to be restricted, and all attempts by personnel to purchase a property through the website are strictly prohibited.

Upon arrival at the site, they discovered a large underground facility with numerous offices and storage areas. All personnel present were wearing business attire and appeared to be conducting some sort of auctioning activity.<br><br>After further investigation, it was determined that the facility was owned by an unknown entity operating under the alias <i>"The Auctioneer"</i>. The Auctioneer appears to acquire abandoned or foreclosed upon mansions from various sources before offering them for sale on <i>SCP-18305</i>. How The Auctioneer manages to acquire these properties is currently unknown.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18305.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18305</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-18305</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> How do you acquire these properties for such low prices? <br><b><i>SCP-18305</i>:</b> We have a network of contacts that we use to source abandoned and foreclosed upon properties.
