She claimed that she did not know any of them and denied ever using Facebook before the incident occurred. The woman later reported being stalked by several individuals claiming to be her <i>"friends."</i> All attempts at tracking down these individuals were unsuccessful; they did not exist prior to the incident occurring and all attempts at locating their IP addresses failed due to unknown error messages received while attempting connection with these addresses.<br><br><b>Date: </b>â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> A man living in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, CA was found dead after being shot by his wife during an argument over him having too many friends on Facebook (over seven hundred). The wife claimed that she believed he was cheating on her with all of his new <i>"friends."</i> An autopsy revealed that none of the new <i>"friends"</i> were real people; they were instead made up profiles created by software programs designed specifically for creating false profiles online as part of viral marketing campaigns for various products and services. The program responsible for creating these profiles has yet to be identified or located; it is believed to be able to operate independently from any computer system connected directly or indirectly with the Internet . Investigation into similar cases has led Foundation agents across multiple continents where similar incidents have occurred under identical circumstances (see Addendum 11183-2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 11183.2 : </h3>Interview with â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, the woman who shot her husband during the incident in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, CA.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after the death of â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ by his wife, â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: Hello, Ms. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ; my name is Dr. [REDACTED].

The man later committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into traffic below after receiving several hundred friend requests on Facebook within a twenty four hour period (see Addendum 11183). Autopsy revealed that none of the new <i>"friends"</i> were real people; they were instead made up profiles created by software programs designed specifically for creating false profiles online as part of viral marketing campaigns for various products and services (see Addendum 11183).

Experiment #: 2 <br><br><b>Date: </b>â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ <h3>Description:</h3> A D-class personnel was instructed to add <i>SCP-11183</i> as a friend on Facebook and then attempt to track down its location using any means available, including but not limited to hacking into Foundation databases, accessing private records belonging to other individuals, etc. <br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject reported having over three hundred friends on Facebook after the incident occurred. After several hours of attempting unsuccessfully to locate <i>SCP-11183</i>'s IP address, the subject was terminated by security personnel for unauthorized access of Foundation resources . Experiment #3 <br><br><b>Date: </b>â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ <h3>Description:</h3> A D-class personnel was instructed to add <i>SCP-11183</i> as a friend on Facebook and then attempt suicide using an electric drill provided by researchers present in the testing chamber (see Addendum 11183.4). <br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject reported having over three hundred friends on Facebook after the incident occurred. After being informed that his suicide attempt had failed due to an unknown error message received while attempting connection with his drill , he became increasingly agitated until he eventually stopped responding entirely . When researchers attempted communication with him again, they found that he had deleted himself from his own account; it is believed that this deletion may have been caused by him deleting himself from existence entirely through suicide . Attempts at reinserting him into reality have thus far proven unsuccessful; it is believed that this is due in part or in whole (see Addendum 11183 -1) because of [DATA EXPUNGED]</div>
