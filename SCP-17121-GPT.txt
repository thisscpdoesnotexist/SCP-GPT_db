I mean, the place had a really eerie vibe to it, even when there weren't any customers around. There were always these weird noises coming from inside the course and sometimes lights would flicker on and off for no reason. I never felt comfortable being there alone, so I usually tried to work with someone else if possible. <br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Did anything else out of the ordinary ever happen while you were working there? <br><b><br>███ ███████:</b> Yeah, one time a group of kids came in to play and I swear I saw something move around the corner. When we went to investigate, there was nothing there but the lights were still flickering like crazy. We all got out of there as fast as we could. <br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you have any theories on what might be causing these phenomena? <br><b><br>███ ███████:</b> Well, it's hard to say for sure but I think it might have something to do with the history of the place. There used to be a carnival that operated nearby and some people say it was haunted by a ghost or something like that… so maybe that has something to do with it? <br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> ████ ███████ was administered a Class-A amnestic and released.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17121.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/20██<br><b><br>Subjects:</b> D-17121-1, D-17121-2, and D-17121-3. All subjects were chosen from a pool of volunteers with no prior knowledge of the anomalous properties of <i>SCP-17121</i>.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subjects were instructed to play a game of minigolf on <i>SCP-17121</i> while personnel monitored their progress from outside the premises.<br><b><br>Results:</b> As soon as all three subjects entered the course, they began experiencing various paranormal phenomena. These included auditory hallucinations such as disembodied voices speaking to them in an unknown language, physical manifestations such as objects being moved or thrown around the area, sudden changes in temperature or lighting, and apparitions appearing out of thin air. The entities interacted with the subjects on multiple occasions; some even attempted physical contact with them before dissipating into thin air shortly after. It should be noted that these effects persisted even after all personnel had evacuated the area; however, they ceased once all three subjects had left <i>SCP-17121</i>'s vicinity.</div>
