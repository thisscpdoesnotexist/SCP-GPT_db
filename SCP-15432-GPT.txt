Is that what you wanted?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Yes it is, thank you very much for your cooperation today Mr… uh… What was it again?<br><br><b>███████████████: </b>It's ███████████ but I don't think we need go into that right now do we? Let's just focus on why I'm here instead shall we?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Right then let's get started shall we? You say you tried to eat <i>SCP-15432</i> despite being aware of its anomalous properties and not having any sort of permission from the site director to do so correct? Why did you do this Mr… uh… [pauses] What was it again again?<br><br>███████████████ [Sighs] Look doc I understand why this is important but can't we just cut through all the crap and get right down to what happened here okay? You know as well as me that there are like five hundred other things in this room with us at any given time so let's just skip all the formalities alright because really who has time for that shit anymore huh?! Christ! [Pauses] Sorry about my language doc but seriously can't we just move on please?! This isn't exactly easy for me either you know! Just ask anyone around here they'll tell ya' how much of a fucking moron I am! So please can we move on already?! Jesus christ! Okay fine whatever if ya' want me ta' say it then fine; fuck it what does it matter anyway; okay look doc when I tried eating 15432 without permission from command or whatever the fuck they're called around here and got caught red handed by one of their stupid little drones or whatever those things are called then guess what happened next huh!? That's right nothing because before anything could happen some big scary looking guy in black armor with some kind of weird helmet came outta nowhere grabbed me by my arm told me he'd take care o' everything himself if I didn't want trouble and dragged me off somewhere else after giving me some bullshit lecture about how eating food without permission is bad or something like that which doesn't make any sense at all because everyone knows food tastes better when someone else cooks it especially when they're making something nice like freshly baked cookies or cakes or muffins oh god those muffins were delicious weren't they doctor!? Oh wait sorry sorry sorry forgot myself there where was i'? Oh yeah he took care o' everything himself so no one had ta worry about getting into trouble including myself which means technically speaking none o' this should be happening now should i'? But hey whaddaya gonna do eh doc sometimes shit happens even though no one wants it too'. So yeah basically nothing happened after he dragged me off somewhere else which makes sense since i'm pretty sure none o' yer people have been able to find him yet have they doctor hmm'? Yeah thought not so basically nothing happened except for maybe his boss yelling at him later probably telling him he shouldn'ta done anything in the first place since technically speaking i'm not supposed ta be allowed ta eat stuff without permission only thing different between us two guys besides his armor costume thingy is tha fact tha he actually listened n didnuts while i've always been more partial towards pancakes myself personally speaking anyways enough about food lets talk abou-' [interrupted].<br><br>[At this point Dr. █████ became visibly uncomfortable.]<br><br><h3>Addendum 15432.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 15432-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-5338, a 23 year old female of European descent. Prior history of mental illness. D-Class status revoked for refusing to fill out form after eating <i>SCP-15432</i>. Terminated by onsite security personnel after attempting to breach containment and consume <i>SCP-15432</i> again.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject's body was found the next day in the Site cafeteria, partially consumed and covered in frosting and sprinkles. The remains were not reclassified as SCP objects, but incinerated as per standard procedure for non-anomalous remains of D-Class personnel who die while under Foundation custody .<br><br>Experiment #: 15432-2<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Drs. ██████ and ████████, both aged 35 at time of experiment. Both have been employed by the Foundation since age 24, with no previous history of mental illness or addiction issues (aside from caffeine dependency). Both are currently married with two children each (Drs ████████ & ██████████ have four children between them). Both signed forms without hesitation or complaint before consuming <i>SCP-15432</i> individually in separate rooms at Site 19 over a period of three days (one bag each day). After consumption was complete they were interviewed together via video conference call while still under effects of <i>SCP-15432</i>'s anomalous properties . Interview conducted by Drs Wilson & Brightman on behalf of O5 Council . Transcript available upon request from Drs Wilson & Brightman .<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>Wilson: </b>Greetings Doctors! We're here today to interview you about your experience consuming… whatever that thing is called?<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>Brightman: </b>Yes! Hello everyone! I'm so excited about this opportunity! I've always wanted to do something like this but never had any friends who would let me eat cake all alone in my office… oh wait you can't see me can you? My bad… anyway yes this is fantastic isn't it? I mean it's just like watching someone else play a videogame except we get to be inside their brain looking out through their eyes instead! So cool right?!<br><br>Dr <br><br><b>Wilson: </b>Uh yeah sure that sounds great actually - now if you could please tell us what happened when you ate that thing then we'll get started? Thanks Doc! <nervous laughter><br><br>Dr <br><br><b>Brightman: </b>Oh right sorry about that - okay so basically there wasn't much warning before it hit me - one moment everything was normal then suddenly everything around me started getting bigger until suddenly my entire field of vision was filled with brightly colored sprinkles and frosting which kept growing larger until they completely blocked out everything else turning my entire world into a sea full of delicious sugary goodness <laughs> it felt amazing ! Then suddenly I felt myself being pulled down towards the ground which got further away as I fell deeper into the sea until eventually there was nothing left above me except for an endless expanse full entirely made up entirely made up entirely made up entirely made up entirely made up [DATA EXPUNGED] <subject begins sobbing uncontrollably> <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br></div>
