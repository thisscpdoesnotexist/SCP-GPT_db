Any personnel interacting with <i>SCP-15628</i> are not to make eye contact with it for longer than 5 seconds, unless given permission by Dr. ██████ .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15628</i> is a male humanoid of unknown origin. <i>SCP-15628</i> is 2.2 meters tall and weighs approximately 70kg, with a muscular build. <i>SCP-15628</i> has dark brown hair and green eyes.<br><br><i>SCP-15628</i> has the ability to make people believe they are its best friend by making eye contact with them for approximately 5 seconds, after which the subject will feel compelled to act as if they are indeed friends with <i>SCP-15628</i>. This effect will last for about 8 hours before wearing off completely, during which time subjects will be unable to remember anything regarding their interaction with <i>SCP-15628</i> other than that they have known each other for years . Subjects affected by this effect have been shown to display increased levels of trust towards <i>SCP-15628</i> despite being unaware of each others' existence prior to exposure . After this period ends, subjects regain all memories regarding their interactions with 15628 and become immune from further effects for 24 hours .<br><br>SCP- 156 28 was recovered from ████████ High School in ██████████ , Minnesota on March 20th 2015 after several students were found acting strangely towards one another , claiming that they had known each other <i>"for years"</i> despite having no previous knowledge of one anothers' existences . Classmates affected by this effect were brought into Foundation custody along with an instance of SCP - 156 28's anomalous properties , following which all instances were administered Class A amnesiacs before being released back into the general population under cover stories created by MTF Eta - 10 (<i>"See No Evil"</i>). All teachers involved in the incident received Class A amnesiacs as well ; however due to the extensive nature of these cover stories it is unlikely that any members involved in said incident will be able to recall it at any point in time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15628.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-15628</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15628</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-15628</i>'s recovery in order to determine the nature of its anomalous properties . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright, I have a few questions for you before we begin the test.
