<h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26056</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Thaumiel</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26056 refers to a cohort of ██ individuals designated Class Đ personnel, each possessing anomalous abilities that contribute to the stabilization and preservation of normalcy. These individuals were identified and contained separately after a series of events that led to the discovery of their unique characteristics. Aggregated analysis suggests that when operating in conjunction, SCP-26056 exhibits a synergistic effect that enhances their anomalous abilities, thereby aiding in containment efforts of other SCPs.</p>
<p>SCP-26056's members possess a wide range of anomalous abilities, including but not limited to: reality anchoring, localized time manipulation, cognitive reshaping, matter transmutation, and extrasensory perception. The unifying trait amongst all SCP-26056 is their shared subconscious drive to maintain the collective unconscious definition of 'reality' as experienced by the majority of the human population.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-26056 is housed in a specialized containment facility located at [REDACTED], designed to accommodate their needs and the unique nature of their abilities. Each member is provided a separate living quarter equipped with standard amenities and tailored modifications to prevent the involuntary manifestation of their anomalous traits.</p>
<p>Interactions between members of SCP-26056 are to be monitored and recorded at all times, and communication is to be facilitated through a secure system to prevent any unauthorized use of their abilities. Personnel assigned to SCP-26056 must undergo thorough mental conditioning to protect against memetic or cognitive anomalies.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach or other critical incidents involving anomalous entities, a protocol known as "Thaumiel Apex" may be enacted, deploying SCP-26056 as a unit to aid in reestablishing control and normalcy.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment 26056-E-01:</strong>
Aim: To assess the individual capabilities and limits of SCP-26056 members.
Procedure: Isolation tests of each member, documenting anomalous effects when presented with various stimuli.
Results: [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26056-E-02:</strong>
Aim: To observe the interactions and collective abilities of SCP-26056.
Procedure: Members were permitted to interact under controlled conditions with a mock containment breach scenario.
Results: SCP-26056 successfully collaborated to suppress and re-contain a simulated Keter-class anomaly. Noticeable enhancement of individual powers was recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 26056-E-03:</strong>
Aim: Testing the limits of SCP-26056's group ability to revert localized reality alterations.
Procedure: Introduction of SCP-████ into SCP-26056's containment area.
Results: SCP-26056 managed to counteract and nullify all reality-warping effects within a radius of ██ meters. Signs of extreme fatigue were observed post-experiment.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Interview Log</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> [REDACTED], member of SCP-26056</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. [REDACTED]</p>
<p><strong><Begin Log></strong></p>
<p>Dr. [REDACTED]: Could you describe your understanding of SCP-26056's group dynamic and your role within it?</p>
<p>[REDACTED]: It's like we're parts of a greater mechanism—I can 'feel' the others' presence in my mind. My role... I think I calm the storms, prevent reality from tearing itself apart when we're in action.</p>
<p>Dr. [REDACTED]: Can you elaborate on the interaction with the other members when 'in action'?</p>
<p>[REDACTED]: It's not just interaction; it's a convergence. We blend into a unified force of will, each enhancement feeding into the next. It's intense and draining, but we stabilize... everything.</p>
<p><strong><End Log></strong></p>
<p><em>Note: The interview suggests SCP-26056 may operate under a hive-mind-like state when employing their abilities collectively.</em></p>

<h3>Addendum 3: Incident Report</h3>
<p>After a containment breach of SCP-████ on [DATE REDACTED], SCP-26056 was deployed. The report details the sequence of events, during which SCP-26056 contained the situation with minimal casualties and infrastructural damage.</p>
<p>Upon re-containment of SCP-████, SCP-26056 members required medical attention due to overexertion of their anomalous abilities. A post-incident evaluation recommended increased recovery time between deployments and further study into the long-term impacts of SCP-26056's collective ability use.</p>
<p>Following this incident, Thaumiel Apex protocol was updated to include a mandatory 48-hour observation period for SCP-26056 members post-deployment, to monitor for any potential adverse effects stemming from their collaboration.</p>
