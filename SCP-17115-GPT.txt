The cupcakes are composed of various organs, including hearts, livers, and intestines. Each cupcake has a distinct flavor that corresponds to the organ used in its creation.<br><br>The cupcakes have been observed to be extremely tasty and often highly sought after by those who come into contact with them.

This effect does not appear to be permanent and can be negated with proper medical attention if necessary.<br><br>In addition, subjects who consume <i>SCP-17115</i> will become increasingly obsessed with consuming more of it until they eventually become unable to resist the urge any longer; this compulsion appears to be linked directly to the flavor associated with each individual cupcake consumed.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17115</i> is to be kept in a secure storage locker at Site-██.
