It is dressed in a black fedora, black suit with matching trousers and shoes, white shirt, and a red tie. Its face appears to be that of a Caucasian male in his late twenties or early thirties.<br><br><i>SCP-19039</i> displays no body language or facial expressions when observed by personnel. However, it has been observed to move its arms as if it were conducting an orchestra while it speaks. When questioned, <i>SCP-19039</i> will respond with long monologues about various topics such as philosophy, history and the nature of reality. These monologues are often incoherent and lack any logical structure or conclusion; however they have been noted to contain some accurate information about certain subjects when researched afterwards by Foundation personnel.<br><br>When attempts are made to physically interact with <i>SCP-19039</i> (such as attempting to touch it) the entity will become agitated and begin speaking louder than before until the attempt is stopped; at which point <i>SCP-19039</i> will return back to its usual behavior of speaking softly but quickly without pause for breath or interruption from outside sources.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19039</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with audio recording equipment and monitored by two personnel at all times. No physical contact with <i>SCP-19039</i> is allowed without prior approval from the site director.<br><br>In order to prevent further spread of its anomalous properties, any personnel who have interacted with <i>SCP-19039</i> must undergo a psychological evaluation before being allowed to interact with other SCPs or leave the facility.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19039.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-19039</i> was observed to be speaking in a language that has yet to be identified by Foundation personnel. Analysis of the audio recordings revealed that it was speaking in an ancient dialect of Latin. Further research is underway.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19039.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19039</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-19039</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████, Site Director of Site-██<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-19039</i>. Can you tell me your name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-19039</i>:</b> Names are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things; they are merely labels that we give to ourselves and others in order to differentiate between individuals. I am simply an entity existing within this reality, nothing more or less than that.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19039.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment Log #19039.3<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-19039</i><br><b>Procedure:</b> An attempt was made to interact with <i>SCP-19039</i> by touching its arm.<br><b>Results:</b> Upon contact, <i>SCP-19039</i> began speaking louder than before and became agitated; it continued to speak in this manner until the experimenter withdrew their hand from contact. Afterwards, it returned back to its usual behavior of speaking quietly but quickly without pause for breath or interruption from outside sources.</div>
