The police were unable to find any motive for his actions, and he was taken into custody. He later claimed that he had no idea why he had done what he did, and when asked about his name, gave the name <i>"Peppa"</i>. After this incident, <i>SCP-15664</i> was discovered on Mr. █████'s computer after it was seized by police officers. An investigation revealed that Mr. █████ owned several other episodes of Peppa Pig in addition to <i>SCP-15664</i> . All instances were found on his computer along with several videos containing child pornography, which led to him being charged with possession of child pornography as well as assault and theft charges.<br><br>+ Addendum 15664 - Addendum 15664 On 11/18/2015 at approximately 9:00 A.M., Agents R██████ and S████████ were sent to investigate an apartment complex in [REDACTED], England due to reports from residents claiming they heard a loud scream coming from one of the apartments at around 8:00 A.M.. When they arrived at the apartment in question (Apartment #3), they found two bodies lying on the floor; both appeared to be male adults in their late 20's or early 30's who had been shot multiple times in their chests with a handgun (later identified as belonging to Agent R██████). However, neither body showed any signs of blood loss or trauma associated with being shot multiple times; instead there appeared only small holes where each bullet would have entered if it weren't for their anomalous properties . Both bodies also showed signs similar to those seen when someone watches too much television , such as dilated pupils , lack of blinking , excessive sweating , etc . Neither body showed any signs consistent with life such as breathing or heartbeat . There were no apparent witnesses present during this incident besides Agents R██████ and S████████ themselves . The only thing left behind by whoever committed this crime is a note written on lined paper reading <i>"I'm watching you"</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 15664.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████<br><br>+ Interview Log 15664-1 - Interview Log 15664-1 <b><br><br><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. B████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15664</i> was discovered in Mr. █████'s possession . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. B████: </b>Hello, Mr. ████, I'm Dr. B████ and I'll be conducting your interview today . <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>Uh… hi? <br><br><b>Dr. B████: </b>So, do you know why we brought you here today? <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>No idea… I just woke up in this room with all these cameras and stuff everywhere… Is this like a TV show or something?
