It calls itself <i>"The Almighty"</i> and has a deep hatred for mankind. Its powers are not yet fully understood.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9181</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> ~~~~~~~<br><br><i>SCP-9181</i>-1 is to be kept in a Vacuum Sealing Container, inside of a Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber. <i>SCP-9181</i>-1 has shown no hostility towards Foundation personnel, so long as it is given water and food twice daily. If <i>SCP-9181</i> tries to escape its containment chamber, it should be sedated with tranquilizers and returned to the container. No living thing(s) should come into contact with <i>SCP-9181</i> for any reason.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9181</i> is a humanoid being, roughly 2 meters tall. <i>SCP-9181</i> has two eyes, one on its head, and another in its navel. There are no other organs inside of <i>SCP-9181</i>'s body, besides the ones that are already expected (heart, lungs). This makes medical examination impossible. The only way to properly examine <i>SCP-9181</i> is through an x-ray or CT scan. It has been discovered that there is a network of nerves all over the body of <i>SCP-9181</i> (except for the head), which connects to each eye and allows it to experience all sensory input at once.<br><br><i>SCP-9181</i> was first discovered when reports of <i>"a man with eyes in his chest"</i> came from ████ County Hospital in ████████ , Florida . After tracking down the individual who had these symptoms, they were found to be suffering with cancerous growths around their navel area (as seen below). After an investigation into this matter by local police officials, it was handed off to local Foundation agents who tracked down 981 before any other civilians could see what was happening and cause a containment breach or public panic.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9181</i> was contained by the Foundation on 10/03/2014. The Foundation took over the ████ County Hospital as it was being evacuated, and brought 981 in for study.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9181.1 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br><h3>Addendum 9181.2 :</h3> 9181's Medical Records<br></div>
