It is to be used as a tool to help fund and facilitate the Foundation's activities.<br><br><i>SCP-9994</i> manifests itself by having the current time displayed on clocks and watches read <i>"25:00"</i>. <i>SCP-9994</i> will not manifest if any of these devices are set to 24:00 or 00:25, or if they are broken and unable to display time.<br><br>The 25th hour in a day can only be accessed by entering one of two rooms that were built specifically for this purpose at Site-19, designated <i>SCP-9994</i>A and <i>SCP-9994</i>B respectively. Both rooms are located on floor B2, which was constructed especially for this purpose. The layout of each room is identical; however, their appearances differ greatly from each other. This difference in appearance causes no effect on the function of either room, nor does it affect those who enter them (see Addendum). Each room has been fitted with an airlock system which allows access into <i>SCP-9994</i> without exposing personnel outside of it to its anomalous properties (see Addendum). In addition, both rooms have been fitted with several monitors connected directly to cameras located within them that allow observation from outside the airlock system without exposing personnel inside it (see Addendum). These monitors have been designated Monitors 1 through 8 respectively; each monitor displays footage recorded by its respective camera below it (see Addendum). The footage recorded shows what would normally be seen while looking around inside either room while standing outside their respective airlocks; however, due to how they were filmed there may occasionally appear some minor distortions when viewed from certain angles or distances away from them . Please see Document 99984 for more information about these distortions . All eight cameras can also record audio picked up by microphones situated around both rooms . Please see Document 9995 for more information about recordings made using these microphones . In addition , all eight monitors have been installed with fully functional keyboards connected directly into their respective computers , allowing anyone viewing them remotely from another computer elsewhere within Site 19 direct control over what camera they view footage recorded by , as well as allowing them access through typed commands into whatever computer controls both rooms' functions ; please see Document 99996 for further details regarding this functionality . Finally , all eight cameras have also been installed with speakers that broadcast audio picked up via microphone directly outwards towards whoever is standing outside their respective airlocks ; please see Document 99997 for more information<br><br><h3>Addendum 9994.1 : </h3>【ACCESS <i>SCP-9994</i>A】<br><br><i>SCP-9994</i>A is a room measuring 8m x 8m x 15m.

It was conducted by Dr. ████████, who had been assigned to <i>SCP-9994</i>'s containment prior to this interview taking place. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Hello? Are you there? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9994</i>A: </b>Yes, I am here; who are you and where am I? <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>My name is Doctor ████████ and we are currently in a room that was built specifically for the purpose of containing you . You have been contained within it since its construction . How do you feel about this? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9994</i>A: </b>Well…I guess I'm not exactly happy about being contained like this; but at least it feels safe in here, which is more than what I can say for the rest of the world outside of it… <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>We understand how you feel; however, we need to ask some questions from you while we attempt to find a way to let all people access your room without exposing them to your anomalous properties . Do you mind answering some questions for us? (SCP doesn't respond) Are…are you still there? (SCP doesn't respond) Do not worry if your answer takes time as long as it isn't too long ; we will wait until a response comes through before asking another question . (SCP doesn't respond) Very well then , please state your name for us so that we may refer to call on when referring back later during our conversation with each other . (SCP doesn't respond) Hello ? Are…are yo u sti ll t h er e ? Sc p -9 9 94 A: Ye s , I 'm he re ; b ut w ha t ar e yo u tr yi ng t o d o t o me ?

So far everything has gone smoothly enough; hopefully she won't try anything unexpected like last time… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After the interview ended, several researchers were sent into both rooms via airlock systems installed inside each one respectively and instructed to retrieve whatever information they could from either room's computers regarding their functions and how they work together with both rooms' cameras and microphones installed inside them as well as how these cameras communicate data between themselves when used together with their respective microphones installed inside them via wireless connections present within each camera's body itself before being returned outside of both rooms via airlock systems installed inside each one respectively after retrieving said information using whatever means necessary without exposing themselves or others directly<br><br><h3>Addendum 9994.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 99994-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-5541, a Caucasian male aged 35. Subject is to enter <i>SCP-9994</i>A and observe footage recorded by Monitors 1 through 8 while standing outside its airlock system . This footage is to be viewed remotely from another computer elsewhere within Site 19. Subject is also to attempt to control the camera view using the keyboard connected directly into Monitor 1's computer , as well as attempting access into whatever computer controls both rooms' functions using typed commands . Finally, subject is instructed not to interact with anything inside <i>SCP-9994</i>A except for its walls and floor .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject enters <i>SCP-9994</i>A and stands in front of Monitors 1 through 8 while simultaneously viewing them from outside of it via Cameras A through H respectively (see Addendum). In addition, subject attempts use of Monitor 1's keyboard and typed commands; however, he does not succeed in doing so (see Addendum). The footage recorded shows what would normally be seen while looking around inside <i>SCP-9994</i>A; however , due to how they were filmed there may occasionally appear some minor distortions when viewed from certain angles or distances away from them. Please see Document 99984 for more information about these distortions. After approximately three minutes have passed since entering the room, subject suddenly becomes aware that he can now hear someone breathing behind him ; this causes him extreme distress which leads him to leave the room without permission immediately after becoming aware of this fact (see Addendum). After leaving <i>SCP-9994</i>A , subject reports being unable to remember anything that occurred inside it after entering it apart from his awareness that someone was breathing behind him ; however , he claims that this did not cause any distress within himself during or after entering the room . He also claims no knowledge about how he left it despite having no recollection of doing so (see Addendum).<br><br>Experiment #: 99994 -2</div>
