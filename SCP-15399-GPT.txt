The song played by <i>SCP-15399</i> is to be recorded and stored on a CD, which is to be kept with the object.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15399</i> is a music box toy, with the words “The Little Mermaid” written on the side. It is made of plastic and wood, and has a metal crank. The toy plays a song when turned, but seems to have no end point or pattern to it. When played for longer than 10 minutes, <i>SCP-15399</i> will begin to play an unknown song that follows no pattern or rhythm previously heard from <i>SCP-15399</i>. This song will continue until the subject leaves the room or stops playing <i>SCP-15399</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-15399</i> was found in ████████'s Toy Store in ██████████ City after reports of several children disappearing near said store were reported by parents of said children. When Foundation Agents raided the store and found <i>SCP-15399</i>, they also found several dead bodies inside; these bodies were later identified as missing persons from nearby towns in Pennsylvania . Autopsies showed that all victims died from massive internal hemorrhaging due to unknown causes; however, all victims had one thing in <br><br><b>common: </b>they had recently visited ████████'s Toy Store prior to their deaths.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15399.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ █████, owner of ████████'s Toy Store<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ██████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>After the raid on his store, Dr. █████████ was sent to interview Mr. ████████ about <i>SCP-15399</i> and the bodies found in his store. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, Mr. ████████, I'm here to ask you some questions about the events that happened here last week; do you mind if I ask you a few questions? <br><br><b>Mr. ████████: </b>Sure thing! What would you like to know? <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Well first off, what is this toy called “The Little Mermaid” that's been reported missing from your store? Mr.: Oh yeah! That was my favorite toy as a kid! I used to play with it all the time until one day it just disappeared… Dr.: And did any of your customers ever report seeing this toy before or after they visited your store? Mr.: Yeah actually! A lot of people said they saw it somewhere else before coming in here; one person even said he saw it at a carnival near [REDACTED]! He said he remembered playing with it there when he was a little kid too… but what does that have anything to do with these murders?! Do you think something happened when we played with this thing?! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>No further action has been taken regarding <i>SCP-15399</i> at this time due to lack of evidence connecting <i>SCP-15399</i> and its song with causing death .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15399.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15399-1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92321<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to crank <i>SCP-15399</i> for 10 minutes.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After subject cranked <i>SCP-15399</i>, it began playing a song that was not previously heard from <i>SCP-15399</i>. The song lasted for 3 hours, after which the subject stopped playing the object and left the room. No anomalous activity was reported during or after experiment. Experiment 15399-2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-92321 (Same subject as previous experiment)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same procedure as previous experiment, with one change; instead of leaving after stopping to play <i>SCP-15399</i>, subject is instructed to stay in room until end of test.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After five minutes into testing, D - 92321 begins convulsing violently and collapses onto floor; shortly afterwards he dies from unknown causes . Autopsy shows massive internal hemorrhaging throughout body , similar to victims found in ████████'s Toy Store . Experiment 15399 -3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 92322 (Died during testing)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same procedure as previous experiments , with one change ; instead of having a guard watch over the test chamber , cameras are set up around it .<br><br><b>Results: </b>During playback of SCP - 153 99 ' s song , camera feed shows no noticeable difference between this test and previous ones ; however at approximately 5 1/2 hours into playback , another music box can be seen in corner of room on ground next to door . This music box is identical in appearance to SCP - 15 399 except for its color scheme being blue rather than red ; when played by itself it plays a different version of [REDACTED] than what was previously heard from SCP - 15 399 . When picked up by D – 92232 , video feed cuts out and all audio feed cuts out except for faint screaming coming from inside chamber; when camera feed returns several seconds later all personnel inside chamber are dead aside from two guards who were knocked unconscious by an unknown force while still alive but severely injured due to broken bones and lacerations across their bodies. Autopsies show that all three subjects died due to massive internal hemorrhaging caused by unknown means similar to victims found in ████████'s Toy Store ; however unlike those victims there were no signs on any wounds caused by sharp objects or claws like those found on other victims .
