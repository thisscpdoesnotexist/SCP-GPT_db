<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21240 is  that, at one point, the plural of "Moose" was "Meese"</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21240<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21240</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that affects the English language, specifically the pluralization of certain words. When a person attempts to form a plural of any word containing the letter <i>"o"</i>, they will unknowingly use <i>"eese"</i> instead of <i>"oes"</i>. This anomaly affects all forms of communication, including spoken and written words.<br><br>For example, when attempting to say or write <i>"moose"</i>, the affected individual will say or write <i>"meese"</i>. Similarly, when attempting to say or write <i>"potatoes"</i>, they will say or write <i>"poteese"</i>.<br><br>This anomaly does not affect proper nouns such as names; for example, if someone were attempting to refer to multiple people named Moose, they would correctly use the plural form “Mooses”. The anomaly also has no effect on other languages; it only affects English.<br><br>The cause of this phenomenon is currently unknown.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the widespread nature of this phenomenon, containment is impossible. All personnel are instructed to be aware of <i>SCP-21240</i> and take steps to ensure that it does not spread further.<br><br>Research into the cause and possible methods of containment is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21240.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a survey was conducted to determine the extent of <i>SCP-21240</i>. The survey revealed that approximately 97% of English speakers were affected by this anomaly.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21240.2: </h3> Interview with Subject<br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-21240-1, a 20 year old female.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Foreword:</b> D-21240-1 was exposed to <i>SCP-21240</i> for a period of two weeks. During this time, she consistently used the incorrect plural form when referring to any words containing <i>"o"</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me what happened? How did you come across this phenomenon?<br><b><br>D-21240-1:</b> I don't really know… it just sort of happened one day out of the blue. I was talking with some friends and we were trying to figure out the plural form of <i>"moose"</i> and somehow everyone started saying <i>"meese"</i>. It felt weird, but none of us questioned it at first because we all agreed that's how it was supposed to be.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you remember any other words that were affected?<br><b><br>D-21240-1:</b> Yeah, I remember <i>"potatoes"</i> became <i>"poteese"</i>. That one was really weird because none of us could figure out why we were saying it like that. We all just sort of accepted it and moved on.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you have any idea how this phenomenon spread?<br><b><br>D-21240-1:</b> Not really, no. We all just sort of accepted it and started using it without thinking about it. I guess over time more people started using it too and now everyone does. It's like a weird kind of groupthink or something.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Is there anything else you can tell me about this phenomenon? Anything at all that might help us understand what's going on here?<br><b><br>D-21240-1:</b> No, not really… sorry, I wish I could be more helpful but that's all I know.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> D-21240-1 was administered Class B amnestics and returned to her normal activities.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21240.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log:</b> On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-21240</i> on an individual. The subject was presented with a series of words and asked to form their plural. All words contained the letter <i>"o"</i>.<br><b><br>Results:</b> The subject consistently used <i>"eese"</i> instead of <i>"oes"</i> when forming plurals.</div>
