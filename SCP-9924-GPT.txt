<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9924</i> is A pair of boxer shorts imbued with the spirit of Mike Tyson</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9924</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9924</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Testing of <i>SCP-9924</i> is currently suspended.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9924</i> is a pair of boxer shorts, brand ████████. The item is made out of 100% cotton and has a tag on the back that reads <i>"Mike Tyson's Undies"</i>. When worn by an individual, <i>SCP-9924</i> will make the subject feel as though they are Mike Tyson. This feeling does not extend to physical appearance or mannerisms, but rather to the subject's mindset. Subjects wearing <i>SCP-9924</i> have been observed to become more aggressive and violent towards others around them.<br><br><i>SCP-9924</i> was discovered in ██████, PA when local police were called to investigate reports of a man assaulting another man with his fists outside his apartment complex. The police found two men arguing in front of one of the apartments while two other men were being treated for injuries nearby. When questioned about what had happened, all four men claimed that they had been attacked by Mike Tyson and suffered injuries as a result (see Addendum). All four men were taken into custody after it was determined that no such person existed at their addresses or within their social circles; however, it was later discovered that all four individuals were wearing boxer shorts with <i>"Mike Tyson"</i> written on them (see Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9924.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Mr. █████ was one of the four men involved in the altercation outside of his apartment complex. <Begin Log, 15/04/2016> Dr. ███: Hello, Mr. █████, thank you for agreeing to this interview with us today. I understand that you were involved in a physical altercation outside your apartment complex yesterday? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Yeah… what happened to those guys anyway? They were acting like they had seen a ghost or something! Dr. ███: We're not at liberty to discuss that right now; however, I can tell you that they are being treated for injuries sustained during their encounter with <i>"Mike Tyson"</i>. Can you please describe what happened yesterday? Mr.: Well… it was just another day; me and my friends went out for drinks after work and went back home around midnight or so - nothing too exciting really - but then we started talking about Mike Tyson and how he's been gone from boxing for years now and how nobody has heard anything about him since he retired from the sport… then all of a sudden there's this knock on my door! At first I thought it was just some kids playing around but when I opened up the door there's no one there except these boxer shorts lying on my doorstep! When I picked them up they started moving by themselves as if someone had thrown them at me! So naturally we thought it was Mike Tyson trying to scare us because that would be hilarious right?! But when we put them on they didn't stop moving until we took them off again! Then we heard knocking at all our neighbors doors so naturally everybody came out thinking it was Mike Tyson trying to scare everyone else too but nobody answered the door when we knocked on it so finally somebody called 911 because apparently seeing boxer shorts move by themselves is scary enough that people call 911 instead of just ignoring them or throwing them away or whatever… Dr.: You said earlier that <i>"Mike Tyson"</i> didn't stop moving until you took him off again- can you elaborate on what exactly happened here? Mr.: Yeah sure- well after putting his boxers back on he came out of my bathroom looking really mad (I think) and tried punching me in the face over and over again while yelling stuff like <i>"you don't want none"</i> <i>"come get some"</i> etcetera etcetera (laughs). The weird thing is though is even though he kept punching me over and over again without letting up once, none of his punches actually hurt which seemed kinda strange right? Like maybe he couldn't actually hurt anyone even though he looked like Mike Tyson himself! It wasn't until later did any real damage start happening; turns out two other guys were wearing boxers with pictures of Mike Tyson written across their chest who got into an argument with each other while trying to figure out if those boxer shorts were real (they weren't) which ended up getting pretty violent pretty fast after both parties refused to listen to reason- one guy ended up getting stabbed in the leg pretty bad before somebody pulled him off before things could escalate further... <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Further investigation revealed no evidence indicating any connection between <i>SCP-9924</i>'s effects and actual instances of Mike Tyson existing within recorded history thus far; however, research into similar anomalous objects related to historical figures remains ongoing as per O5 directive 9924/2b<br><br><h3>Addendum 9924.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9924-1<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9924-1 was instructed to put on <i>SCP-9924</i>. Once he was wearing the item, he was asked to describe his surroundings. After doing so, he was told to punch Researcher ██████ in the face.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-9924-1 described his surroundings as a boxing ring and Researcher ██████ as a member of an opposing team. He then proceeded to charge at Researcher ██████ and punched him in the mouth with full force. The researcher suffered minor injuries and reported that it felt like being hit by Mike Tyson (see Addendum).<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9924-2, -3, -4 (one subject per boxer shorts)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>All three subjects were instructed to put on their respective boxer shorts (SCP 9924) at the same time and were then asked what they saw when they looked around them. They were then told that there would be no repercussions for attacking each other and encouraged to do so if they wished; however, all three subjects agreed not to engage in physical combat with one another after some initial shoving began between them. All three subjects were later interviewed individually about their experiences while wearing SCP 9924; however, none of them could remember anything beyond putting on the boxers until after they had been removed from their bodies. Additionally, all three subjects claimed that it felt like being hit by Mike Tyson when questioned about how it felt during testing (see Addendum).</div>
