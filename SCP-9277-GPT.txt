When <i>SCP-9277</i> enters a shoe, it will not emerge until it has consumed all living organisms located within the shoe, usually within 24 hours.<br><br>When one or more pairs of shoes contain <i>SCP-9277</i>, all other pairs of shoes are to be removed from their homes immediately and sent for incineration with no further testing allowed (see Addendum 9277-01). If any pair is found outside its home without being incinerated within 48 hours after discovery, they are to be considered out of control and treated as such (see Addendum 9277-02).<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9277</i> is a white spider with an average size of 10 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height when fully grown. X-ray images reveal no unusual internal structure (see Addendum 9277-03). Its body is completely hairless, but has a thick layer of silk covering it, which seems to double as a layer of armor against physical harm.<br><br><i>SCP-9277</i> moves quickly and erratically when outside its hideout and consumes all living organisms—whether plant or animal—in its path by wrapping them in silk until they are unable to move or breathe. If there are no other organisms around for it to consume, <i>SCP-9277</i> will attempt to leave the area by any means possible (it has been seen climbing on walls and ceilings more than once). It also does not consume humans unless there are none other animals around for it to consume first; however, if given the opportunity, <i>SCP-9277</i> will try and attack any human near it before running away and leaving the shoe.<br><br>Once inside a shoe that contains living organisms, <i>SCP-9277</i> will remain stationary until every inhabitant has been consumed. While doing so it seems completely immune to all forms of chemical sedation or distraction; however some researchers have reported hearing sighs coming from within their shoes after hours without rest while wearing <i>SCP-9277</i>'s containment shoes. It is theorized that these may just be gasps for air from prey being consumed alive… or something else entirely… but this theory cannot yet be confirmed due to security concerns regarding personnel conducting further testing with live mice inside their own containment shoes .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9277</i> was discovered after several reports of missing pets began emerging from █████, France. After the Foundation gained permission to investigate, the source of the missing animals was determined to be <i>SCP-9277</i>. Although no shoes were initially found near any of its hiding places, it did not take long for researchers to determine that <i>SCP-9277</i> must have been inside all of them. Once containment procedures were put into place and all pairs of shoes were removed from their homes, <i>SCP-9277</i> became docile and stopped attempting to leave its hideouts (see Addendum 9277-04).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9277.1 :</h3> Testing Logs<br><br>All testing has ceased. Testing was deemed too risky due to the amoral and unpredictable behavior of <i>SCP-9277</i>, which can be found in further detail in Addendum 9277-02.<br><br><br>Subject: <i>SCP-9277</i><br><br><br>Procedure: <i>SCP-9277</i> was placed inside a small glass cage containing █ mice to test its response to a possible food source. Staff members were instructed not to wear any footwear outside of their office for the duration of this experiment. Researcher ████ was given an additional pair of shoes as part of his personal equipment for this experiment only, and was instructed not to wear them outside the laboratory if he could avoid it . After 24 hours all living organisms were removed from the cage and incinerated. The enclosure with <i>SCP-9277</i> inside was then cleaned using an industrial vacuum cleaner (which had been drained completely earlier). No anomalous activity occurred during or after this test apart from some sighing coming from within Researcher ████'s shoes . Upon questioning, Researcher ████ claimed that he <i>"wasn't really paying attention at that point."</i> This is considered normal behavior for him when conducting tests on animals while wearing a lab coat over his footwear; however staff have reported being unnerved by seeing him walk back into the laboratory with several dead insects on his coat that he claimed fell off a tree while he was walking down the street towards work again later that day… However these reports are most likely false since no insects matching those found near Researcher ████'s workplace have been sighted anywhere else in France during our extensive search efforts , nor did they match any known species we have records of… but they are still being analyzed [REDACTED]<br><br><br>Subject: D-16073 (Female, age 38) is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation after being sent back into containment repeatedly claiming she <i>"couldn't stop thinking about how sad my shoes looked"</i> following previous tests involving D-class personnel wearing new pairs every day [DATA EXPUNGED] before moving onto testing live mice inside their own containment shoes without telling them what they would be doing beforehand just so I could see what would happen when exposed directly to <i>SCP-</i>[Data Expunged]. However each time she entered her containment shoe she became very agitated claiming there were bugs crawling all over her feet despite there being none present within or around her shoe at any time during or after each testing session . After two weeks she started screaming about seeing spiders everywhere around her even though none existed and refused to leave her cell under any circumstances; however we decided it would be best not to send D-[REDACTED] back into isolation until she stopped acting strangely altogether since we didn't want another incident like last time where multiple D-[DATA EXPUNGED] causing $████████ worth of damage before finally dying due [DATA REDACTED]. Instead we've decided it is safer just simply let them roam freely throughout Site 19's lower levels until either someone accidentally leaves<br><br><h3>Addendum 9277.2 :</h3> Incident 9277-A<br><br>On 19/01/20██, an explosion was heard coming from the area near <i>SCP-9277</i>'s containment chamber, located in the basement of Site 19. The blast severely damaged ██ staff members and ██ researchers while causing fires to break out along multiple hallways, which required extensive cleaning afterwards. When the fire was put out, <i>SCP-9277</i>'s containment shoe had been completely destroyed by an unknown force (a Bic lighter was found on the floor nearby with a handwritten note attached saying <i>"Why don't you just leave us alone?"</i>) and it is believed to have escaped into Site 19 through one of its many air vents or through cracks in its walls caused by this incident . Numerous reports came in from personnel claiming to see <i>SCP-9277</i> walking slowly towards them at various locations throughout Site 19 over the next few days. These sightings were not expected since we believed it to be inactive after destroying its hideout… However these sightings increased during lunch hours and receded during non work hours (with only one sighting occurring during a non work day) suggesting that our earlier hypothesis may have been incorrect… But if that were true then why wouldn't it actively attack personnel at random while they are off duty? I think something else must be going on here… but what?<br><br></div>
