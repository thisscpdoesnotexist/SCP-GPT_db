Can you hear me? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14526</i>-1: </b>Yes, I can hear you just fine. What do you want? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>I'm here to ask some questions about how you got here and what this place is like for you now? <i>SCP-14526</i>-1 sighs heavily, but does not respond for several minutes. When it does speak again, its voice sounds much more distant than before, as if it were speaking from far away instead of across a table from the interviewer's position in the room they are both currently occupying. <i>SCP-14526</i> - 1: This place… It's so dark and lonely here… There's no one to talk to or play with anymore… Just me and my toys… And now that I think about it, there never really were any other kids around here when I lived back home either… We always seemed to be alone wherever we went... Even at school... Everyone else would just ignore us or pretend we didn't exist unless they needed something from us... Then we'd get sent off by ourselves again until someone else needed something from us again later that day.. Or maybe even tomorrow if our parents weren't busy enough already with their own work or stuff like that.. All those people out there in The Backrooms are probably all alone like me too now too though.. They're just sitting there waiting for someone else to come along so they can have someone new to play with for a little while before everyone forgets about them too and sends them off on their own again somewhere else where nobody will bother them ever again until they die all alone without anyone ever coming back into The Backrooms except maybe once every few months when somebody has time between projects or whatever just long enough to take some pictures of all their old stuff sitting around somewhere inside one of these rooms then forget about everything right away because they have other things more important than anything that happened way back then during childhood when everyone was still alive and happy instead of dead forever which is why everything ended up this way anyway because none of those people out there cared enough even after everything turned into nothing but ruin everywhere forever which is why none of them will ever come back into The Backrooms ever again except maybe once every few months whenever somebody has time between projects or whatever long enough only long enough only long enough only long enough only lonnnnnnngggggg…… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After approximately ten minutes following this statement being recorded by DAT recorder #42B4A7F4 (standard issue Foundation audio recording device), an unidentified individual wearing an unknown type armor entered through an open window located on the north wall directly behind where DAT recorder #42B4A7F4 had been placed prior to interview beginning (see attached floor plan). This individual proceeded across the room without making any noise whatsoever despite possessing heavy footfalls consistent with previous observations made regarding personnel wearing standard issue military grade boots while walking across concrete surfaces such as those present within Site 19 at time interview began recording (see attached floor plan).

D-14526 reported no unusual activity during this experiment.<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-14526</i> does not lead to The Backrooms, but rather links directly to the location where it was found. Further testing is required before we can determine if <i>SCP-14526</i> has any anomalous properties whatsoever . Experiment 14527 - Close Experiment 14527 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Researcher ██████ (D-████████), a 38 year old male with an IQ of 173 .<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A remote camera will be placed in front of <i>SCP-14526</i> so as to record any activity inside the portal without exposing personnel to danger or contamination from The Backrooms .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Camera records show that after Researcher ██████ enters the portal he appears on a street corner in Paris, France circa 18██. Researcher ██████ then walks down the street until he comes across an apartment building with his name on it (the address matches his home address). He enters said building and disappears from view for approximately 5 minutes before reappearing through <i>SCP-14526</i> and returning back into Foundation custody without incident . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that while within The Backrooms one is able to travel through time as well as space . Further testing required . + Addendum 14528 - Close Addendum 14528 On 07/23/20██, several items were discovered missing from Site 19's storage facility including various pieces of furniture , art work , office supplies , clothing items , etc… All items have been traced back through their serial numbers or other identifying marks back into their original owners homes at some point over the past two years but none have ever been reported stolen by their owners nor do they appear on any police records for stolen goods.</div>
