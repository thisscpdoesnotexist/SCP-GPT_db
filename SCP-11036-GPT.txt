No personnel are allowed to speak the word <i>"<i>SCP-11036</i>"</i> out loud, nor are they allowed to write it down or communicate it in any other way. Personnel who have been exposed to <i>SCP-11036</i> must be quarantined for no less than 72 hours and administered Class A amnestics afterwards.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11036</i> is a word that, when spoken out loud, will cause the listener to perceive a large number of humanoid entities. This perception is consistent between individuals and cannot be prevented by any known means. These entities appear to have no physical form, but have been described as being <i>"made of smoke"</i> or <i>"made of shadows"</i>. <i>SCP-11036</i> has no apparent pattern in who it affects; affected individuals are spread across all areas of society and are not more likely to be affected based on occupation or location.<br><br><i>SCP-11036</i> was discovered after reports from multiple civilians about seeing <i>"people made out of smoke"</i> around ████████ ████ High School in ████████, Pennsylvania. Agents were dispatched and found that there were indeed several instances of <i>SCP-11036</i> present at the school. The school was evacuated and Class A amnestics distributed while MTF Nu-7 (<i>"Hammer Down"</i>) agents were sent into the building to neutralize all instances of <i>SCP-11036</i> they could find. All persons involved in this incident were administered Class A amnestics afterwards and none retained any memories related to <i>SCP-11036</i> upon interview after being released from quarantine .<br><br><h3>Addendum 11036.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████, the first person to be exposed to <i>SCP-11036</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 11036.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test 11036-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-11036, a Class D personnel who had been exposed to <i>SCP-11036</i> prior to the experiment.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject is instructed to speak the word <i>"<i>SCP-11036</i>"</i> out loud.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon speaking the word, subject immediately reported seeing several humanoid entities made of smoke in his peripheral vision. These entities were described as having no facial features and wearing clothing consistent with that of students at ████████ ████ High School (where <i>SCP-11036</i> was first discovered). The entities did not appear to notice subject; they appeared to be staring at a point on the wall behind him. Subject was instructed to continue speaking and describe what he saw while doing so. After approximately five seconds, all instances of <i>SCP-11036</i> disappeared from sight and subject reported feeling <i>"tired"</i>. Subject was then told that he could stop speaking; after doing so, all instances of <i>SCP-11036</i> reappeared in his field of vision and he described them as still being there before expressing confusion about their presence .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>Subjects who have been exposed previously do not appear able to perceive any additional instances of <i>SCP-11036</i> if they are already present when another instance is created . It appears that once an instance has been perceived by an individual, it will remain in their field of vision for 5 seconds before disappearing unless it is directly looked at during this time period . This effect also does not seem dependent on line of sight; affected individuals can still perceive these entities even if their eyes are closed or covered by something opaque .<br><br>Test 11036 -2:</div>
