<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-16993</i> is  a city map that when updated changes the layout of the actual city</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-16993</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3><br><br><i>SCP-16993</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at all times when not being tested. Access to <i>SCP-16993</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any personnel attempting to take control of <i>SCP-16993</i> must be monitored and supervised by two (2) security guards at all times.<br><br>Testing of <i>SCP-16993</i> must be approved by the Site Director before it can begin, and any changes made during testing must be reversed once testing has concluded. If any permanent changes are made then they must be reported immediately and appropriate measures taken to contain them as necessary.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-16993</i> is a city map that when updated changes the layout of the actual city. The map appears to be an exact replica of the city it represents, and will update itself with any changes made in the real world.<br><br>The map's scale is 1:1, meaning that one square on the map equals one square meter in reality. When <i>SCP-16993</i> updates itself, any buildings or other structures present in its area are removed from reality and replaced with whatever was previously indicated on <i>SCP-16993</i>. This includes roads, parks, rivers, etc., as well as anything else depicted on <i>SCP-16993</i>.<br><br>When viewed by anyone not directly connected to <i>SCP-16993</i> (i.e., not touching it), it appears to be a normal paper city map with no anomalous properties whatsoever. However, if someone touches or holds onto <i>SCP-16993</i> while looking at it they can see all of its features change before their eyes as if they were watching a live video feed of the actual city being altered around them in real time.<br><br>When held by an individual for more than five minutes without interruption or interference from outside sources (such as another person trying to take control of<i>SCP-16993</i>) then said individual will become linked to SCP- 16993 and gain full control over its effects until either they release their grip on it or someone else takes possession ofSCP - 1693 . If this happens then whoever has taken ownership will have full control over what changes are made within the affected area and how long those changes last for before reverting back to normalcy again after some time passes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 16993.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, <i>SCP-16993</i> was used by personnel to temporarily relocate a small village of ██ citizens in order to avoid a natural disaster. The relocation was successful and the villagers were returned to their original location once the danger had passed. This is the only known instance of <i>SCP-16993</i> being used for this purpose.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16993.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>How did you come across <i>SCP-16993</i>?<br><br><b>Interviewee: </b>I was walking around the city one day and noticed that it seemed like the layout of the streets had changed, but when I looked at a map nothing had really changed. That's when I realized something strange was going on and decided to investigate further. Eventually, I found <i>SCP-16993</i> in an abandoned building and figured out what it could do.<br><br><h3>Addendum 16993.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Test #1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-Class personnel<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to take hold of <i>SCP-16993</i> and manipulate the map.<br><br><b>Results: </b>The subject was able to successfully alter the layout of a small area on the map, creating a new road and changing the location of some buildings. These changes were reflected in reality after approximately 5 minutes.</div>
