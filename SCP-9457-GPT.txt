If anyone other than Dr. ███████ discovers <i>SCP-9457</i>, they are to immediately report it, and the object will be removed from their possession.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9457</i> is a small, black satchel. If it is opened by anyone other than Dr. ███████, and anything is placed inside it, the item will instantly disappear, and a small bag of marijuana will appear in its place.<br><br><i>SCP-9457</i> was found in the possession of Mr. ████ ████████ after he reported to police that his house had been burglarized by an unknown person or persons on 11/4/<br>█████████ at 05:43 PM EST . <i>SCP-9457</i> was discovered under the pillow of Mr. ████'s bed after he was apprehended by police for questioning. After being taken into custody, Mr. ████ refused to answer any questions regarding <i>SCP-9457</i> or how it came into his possession before being transported to Site 19 for containment procedures while under standard interrogation techniques;<br> however he did describe what happened on the night in question as follows:<br><br><i>"I was asleep when I heard some rustling downstairs late at night; I thought nothing of it until my wife told me she heard some stuff rattling about too."</i> <i>"I didn't want to get up because I knew something would be stolen; not like we can afford new stuff anyways."</i> <i>"Anyways later that night I woke up from more noise downstairs and saw someone steal my weed stash!"</i> <i>"He ran away with a bag full of weed so I jumped outta bed just as fast! There were 2 bags there but they both disappeared before they got outta sight!"</i> <i>"I chased them down the street but they just vanished into thin air…or something like that…"</i><br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9457</i> was recovered from Mr. ████'s possession after it was found under his pillow by Officer ██████ during a search of the premises. Due to the unusual nature of its recovery, Class-B amnestics were administered to Mr. ████ and the police force involved in handling his case, as well as an additional two D-Class under standard amnestic procedures before being transported to Site 19 for containment procedures while under standard interrogation techniques.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9457.1 :</h3> Testing Logs<br><br>+<br> Show test log - hide text Test #: 9457-1 Subject: D-1930 Procedure: D-1930 is instructed to place a live mouse into <i>SCP-9457</i> and seal the bag.<br> Results: Upon sealing the bag, D-1930 informs Dr. ███████ that the mouse is no longer moving inside. Visual inspection reveals that the mouse has disappeared from its original position, and a small pouch of marijuana has appeared in its place.<br> Notes: The object appears to have produced what was asked of it; however there are no similar reports of any user being able to produce as much as 2 kg at once from this item.<br> Test #: 9457-2 Subject: D-4321 Procedure: A single cigarette is placed in <i>SCP-9457</i> before it is sealed by Dr. ███████ using an adhesive strip (as opposed to her hand).<br> Results: Upon opening <i>SCP-9457</i>, Dr. ███████ discovers a many small marijuana cigarettes instead of the one she placed inside before sealing it shut; all appearing identical in nature with each other despite their size difference with no noticeable difference between them aside from their size and weight (this would be repeated on every item tested afterward).<br> Notes : This effect will only occur if something that can be smoked like tobacco products or weed are put into <i>SCP-9457</i> . The quantity produced seems to vary depending on how much was originally inside for some reason despite displaying no other anomalous effects besides size differences upon opening it again; this suggests this effect does not actually increase its contents but rather creates more items out of thin air .<br> Test # : 9457 - 3 Subject : D - 4332 Procedure : A sample cup containing 2 grams worth of soil from Site 19'<br>s Sector B Greenhouse is placed within SCP - 9459 results : After approximately 5 seconds , a sample cup containing 3 grams worth of soil identical in composition with samples taken from Site 19's Sector B Greenhouse is removed instead ; all tests conducted afterward have yielded similar results whenever placing organic material such as plant matter , animal matter or organic compounds found within various cell cultures used for experimentation purposes into SCP – 9459 instead .<br> Notes : This phenomenon occurs when testing anything organic regardless if they exist naturally, were artificially created through genetic engineering or if they cannot even be considered living things such as certain types chemical compounds found within certain cell cultures used for experimentation purposes which explains why certain anomalies can also be affected by putting them inside . Further analysis may reveal what specific properties allow these objects or substances to function similarly under these circumstances based on whether they were created naturally artificial means but further testing needs to take place first due to current limitations we currently possess regarding our technology available<br><br>+ Show test log - hide text Addendum<br><br><h3>Addendum 9457.2 :</h3> On ██/██/████, D-9331 was instructed to place one sheet of non-anomalous A4 paper into <i>SCP-9457</i>. Upon opening the bag and removing the said sheet, it was discovered that a much larger amount of sheets had been produced instead. Further testing with other items revealed that the object still only produces an equivalent amount when opened despite their size differences.</div>
