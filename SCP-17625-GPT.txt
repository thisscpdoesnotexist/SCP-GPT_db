It will construct a web-like structure within the can before entering a dormant state. When disturbed by sound or vibration, <i>SCP-17625</i> will emerge from the can and attempt to attach itself to any nearby organic life form via its mouthparts. Once attached, <i>SCP-17625</i> will begin to feed on its host's blood while simultaneously injecting an unknown neurotoxin into their body via microscopic pores located along its body surface. This neurotoxin causes severe pain throughout the host's body as well as paralysis in some cases. If left unattended for too long, <i>SCP-17625</i> may eventually cause death due to blood loss or organ failure caused by the neurotoxin poisoning.<br><br>It is believed that <i>SCP-17625</i> reproduces through asexual means; however this has yet to be confirmed due to lack of specimens available for study at this time<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17625</i> is to be contained in a secure storage locker at Site-██. All personnel entering the containment area must wear protective gear and gloves to avoid contact with <i>SCP-17625</i>. Any cans containing <i>SCP-17625</i> are to be immediately disposed of, and all personnel who come into contact with them must undergo decontamination procedures.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17625.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a large number of cans containing <i>SCP-17625</i> were discovered in an abandoned warehouse. All cans were immediately disposed of and all personnel who came into contact with them underwent decontamination procedures.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17625.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Interviewee:</b> <i>SCP-17625</i><br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> How did you come to be in a can?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17625</i>:</b> I was born here, in the cans. It's my home, and it provides me with sustenance and shelter. I don't remember any other life before this one.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> What do you use the neurotoxin for?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17625</i>:</b> It's a defense mechanism. I inject it into my host to paralyze them and make it easier for me to feed on their blood without being disturbed. It's also a way for me to protect myself from predators.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17625.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 17625-1:</b> A single can containing <i>SCP-17625</i> was placed in a soundproof chamber and monitored for activity. After approximately 10 minutes, the can began to vibrate as <i>SCP-17625</i> emerged from it. It then proceeded to attempt to attach itself to the nearest organic life form (in this case, a D-Class personnel). The subject was immediately sedated before <i>SCP-17625</i> could do any further damage and subsequently removed from the chamber.<br><b><br>Results:</b> <i>SCP-17625</i> successfully attached itself to the subject and injected an unknown neurotoxin into their body before being subdued by personnel. The neurotoxin caused severe pain throughout the subject's body as well as paralysis in some cases.</div>
