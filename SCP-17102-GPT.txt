<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17102 is  Bees?????? (Oh no!)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17102<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17102</i> is a species of bee that exhibits anomalous behavior, specifically the ability to produce and manipulate fire. The bees are capable of producing an intense flame from their abdomens, which can be used to ignite combustible materials or cause burns on living beings. <i>SCP-17102</i>'s flames are not affected by any known extinguishing methods, and have been observed burning for up to three hours before dissipating naturally.<br><br>The origin of <i>SCP-17102</i> is unknown; however, it has been hypothesized that they may originate from a hive located in [REDACTED] region of [REDACTED] country.<br><br><i>SCP-17102</i>'s behavior towards humans is unpredictable; while some colonies will remain dormant until provoked, other colonies have been seen attacking humans without provocation or warning. It should also be noted that these bees appear to be highly intelligent and organized despite their lack of communication skills; they have been observed working together in complex tasks such as building structures out of combustible materials and using them as weapons against potential threats.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> All known colonies of <i>SCP-17102</i> are to be monitored and contained by Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (<i>"Red Haze"</i>). Any new colonies discovered are to be reported immediately and contained in a secure facility.<br><br>Personnel assigned to containment of <i>SCP-17102</i> must wear flame retardant suits at all times, as well as protective eyewear. All personnel must also maintain a minimum distance of 10 meters from the colony at all times.<br><br>In the event that an attack is imminent, personnel should retreat to a safe distance and await further instructions from MTF Gamma-5 command.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17102.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, MTF Gamma-5 was dispatched to [REDACTED] region of [REDACTED] country in response to reports of a large swarm of <i>SCP-17102</i>. Upon arrival, the team discovered a large hive containing approximately 500 specimens. After several hours of containment and observation, the team was able to successfully capture all specimens without incident. All captured specimens have been transferred to Site-██ for further study and containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17102.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17102</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of researchers from MTF Gamma-5 was sent to [REDACTED] region in order to investigate the origin of <i>SCP-17102</i>. Upon arriving at the site, they encountered an active colony and were able to capture a single specimen for further study. The following is a transcript of the interview conducted with <i>SCP-17102</i>:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell me your name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17102</i>:</b> I do not have one. We are all part of the same hive mind.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What is your purpose?<br><b><br><i>SCP-17102</i>:</b> We are here to protect our hive and ensure its survival. We use our flames to ward off potential threats and keep the hive safe.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17102.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> A single bee was placed in a sealed chamber and observed for two hours. The bee remained dormant until the end of the observation period, when it suddenly produced a flame from its abdomen and began to fly around the chamber at high speed. After several minutes, the flame dissipated and the bee returned to its original position on the floor.<br><b><br>Results:</b> No further anomalous behavior was observed during this test.</div>
