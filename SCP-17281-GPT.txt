<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17281 is  a cyber woman with corn</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17281<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17281</i> is an entity composed of a humanoid female body made entirely from corn. <i>SCP-17281</i> stands at 1.8 meters in height and weighs approximately 80kg, with the majority of its mass consisting of kernels and husks.<br><br><i>SCP-17281</i> displays sapience, able to communicate through verbal speech as well as utilizing sign language and gestures. Its speech patterns are mostly incoherent, however it has been observed to use words such as <i>"food"</i> or <i>"hungry"</i>.<br><br>When not provided with food sources, <i>SCP-17281</i> will attempt to consume any organic material in its vicinity including living organisms such as humans or animals. It has also been observed attempting to steal food from nearby stores or restaurants when possible. <br><br>When agitated by personnel or other entities, <i>SCP-17281</i> will enter a state of extreme aggression where it will attack anything within range regardless of size or strength using its hands and feet which have been noted to be abnormally strong for an entity composed entirely out of corn husks and kernels. <br><br>In addition, when exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods of time (more than 10 minutes) <i>SCP-17281</i>'s body begins slowly decomposing into individual pieces until nothing remains but a pile of dried up corn husks on the ground. After this process is complete it can be reassembled using similar methods used during its initial containment procedure (see Addendum 17281). <br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-17281</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at all times. The cell must be kept dark and cool with no direct sunlight entering the room.<br><br>Personnel are to provide <i>SCP-17281</i> with food sources on a daily basis, ensuring that it does not starve or become agitated due to hunger. If personnel are required to enter the containment chamber for any reason, they must wear protective gear as <i>SCP-17281</i> has been known to attack personnel when provoked. <br><br>In addition, if <i>SCP-17281</i>'s body begins decomposing due to exposure of direct sunlight, personnel must immediately reassemble its body using similar methods used during its initial containment procedure (see Addendum 17281). <br><br><br><h3> Addendum 17281.1: </h3> Initial Containment Procedure<br><br><i>SCP-17281</i> was initially discovered in a cornfield near ███████, USA. Upon arrival, personnel were able to contain the entity without incident by using specialized containment equipment. <br><br>The containment chamber was then filled with dark soil and covered with a thick layer of plastic wrap to prevent direct sunlight from entering the room. The entity was then provided with food sources on a daily basis to ensure it did not become agitated or attempt escape due to hunger.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17281.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-17281</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-17281</i> <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████ <br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt<br>Dr. ████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-17281</i>. Can you tell me your name? <br><b><i>SCP-17281</i>:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> Do you understand what I'm saying? <br><b><i>SCP-17281</i>:</b> [Nods its head] <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> Alright then, can you tell me why you are here?  <br><b><i>SCP-17281</i>:</b> Hungry… food… eat… <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> I understand that you are hungry, but why did we bring you here? <br><b><i>SCP-17281</i>:</b> [No response] <br><b>Dr. ████:</b> Do you know how you were created? <br><b><i>SCP-17281</i>:</b> [Shakes its head] <br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-17281</i> was unable to provide any further information.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17281.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment 17281.3 was conducted to determine the effects of direct sunlight on <i>SCP-17281</i>'s body.<br><b><br>Result:</b> After approximately 10 minutes of exposure to direct sunlight, <i>SCP-17281</i>'s body began slowly decomposing into individual pieces until nothing remained but a pile of dried up corn husks on the ground. <br><b><br>Conclusion:</b> Direct sunlight causes <i>SCP-17281</i>'s body to decompose quickly and must be avoided at all costs in order to prevent it from entering this state again.</div>
