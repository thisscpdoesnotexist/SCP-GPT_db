<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-17975 is  a living apartment</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-17975<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-17975</i> is an apartment complex located in [REDACTED], Germany. The building appears to be a standard residential dwelling, and contains several apartments of varying sizes. However, the interior of <i>SCP-17975</i> is constantly shifting and changing, with new rooms being added or removed as time passes.<br><br>The occupants of <i>SCP-17975</i> are humanoid entities that appear to be living in the apartment complex. These entities are highly intelligent and will interact with any individuals who enter their home. They will often offer hospitality to visitors, including food and drink, although they do not seem to need sustenance themselves.<br><br>The inhabitants of <i>SCP-17975</i> have been observed engaging in various activities such as reading books, playing board games, discussing philosophy or politics, cooking meals for each other or entertaining guests from outside the complex. They also seem to possess some form of telepathic communication between them which allows them to coordinate their actions without speaking aloud.<br><br>It has been noted that the inhabitants occasionally leave <i>SCP-17975</i> for short periods of time but always return shortly afterwards; it is unknown where they go during these absences or why they leave at all. Additionally, no one has ever seen anyone enter or exit the building aside from its own inhabitants; it appears that they can somehow pass through walls without opening doors or windows when leaving and entering their home<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the nature of <i>SCP-17975</i>, containment is difficult. As such, it is recommended that personnel maintain a low profile when entering and exiting the building. Personnel are not to interact with any of the inhabitants unless absolutely necessary.<br><br>In order to prevent knowledge of <i>SCP-17975</i> from spreading, all visitors must be monitored and questioned upon leaving the complex. Any information regarding <i>SCP-17975</i> must be suppressed or altered as needed in order to protect its secrecy.<br><br>Additionally, surveillance equipment should be installed around <i>SCP-17975</i> in order to monitor any activity within or near it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17975.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a small group of personnel were sent into <i>SCP-17975</i> to investigate its interior. Upon entering the building, they discovered that the walls and furniture had shifted significantly from when they had last seen it. The personnel also noticed that several of the inhabitants appeared to be in a state of distress; one was crying while another was frantically searching for something.<br><br>When questioned, the inhabitants revealed that one of their own had gone missing during their most recent excursion outside <i>SCP-17975</i> and they feared he may have been abducted by an unknown party. They asked if any personnel could help them locate him, but no assistance could be provided at this time.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17975.2: </h3> Interview with an inhabitant<br><br>On ██/██/████, a member of the Foundation was sent to interview an inhabitant of <i>SCP-17975</i>. The following is a transcript of the conversation that took place:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Hello there. Can you tell me your name?<br><b><br>Inhabitant:</b> My name is [REDACTED]. What do you want to know?<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What can you tell me about this place?<br><b><br>Inhabitant:</b> This is our home. We are all connected to each other, and we care for one another. We have been here for a long time, but it feels like only yesterday that we moved in.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> How long have you been living here?<br><b><br>Inhabitant:</b> I'm not sure. Time passes differently for us. It could be years, or it could be centuries. All that matters is that we are here together, and that we take care of each other.<br><br><h3> Addendum 17975.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of researchers entered <i>SCP-17975</i> in order to observe its inhabitants and attempt to communicate with them. The following is a log of the experiment:<br><br>• Upon entering the building, the team was greeted by several of the inhabitants who welcomed them warmly and offered refreshments. They seemed friendly and inquisitive about their visitors, asking numerous questions about their lives outside <i>SCP-17975</i>.<br><br>• The team attempted to engage in conversation with the inhabitants but were unable to do so beyond basic pleasantries; it appeared that they could not understand any language other than their own. However, they did seem interested in what was being said and responded positively when asked questions or given compliments.<br><br>• After approximately two hours of observation, one of the researchers attempted to leave <i>SCP-17975</i> without permission from its inhabitants; however, he found himself unable to do so as if an invisible barrier had been erected around him preventing his exit. He was eventually allowed to leave after explaining his intentions and apologizing for his actions.</div>
