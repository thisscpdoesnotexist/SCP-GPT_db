Different types of rats will appear depending on how the button is pressed</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-17073</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-17073</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Access to <i>SCP-17073</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any rats produced by <i>SCP-17073</i> are to be captured and humanely euthanized, then disposed of in accordance with standard biohazard protocols. <br><br>In the event that any rats produced by <i>SCP-17073</i> escape containment, all available personnel are to be dispatched for their retrieval and relocation back into the containment locker.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17073</i> is a white plastic button, approximately 2 cm in diameter, with the caption <i>"push for rat"</i> printed on its surface. When pressed, <i>SCP-17073</i> will produce one of several types of rats from an unknown source. The type of rat produced is determined by how the button is pressed:<br><br>• Lightly pressing the button will result in a small brown rat appearing.<br><br>• Pressing and holding the button down for five seconds will cause a large black rat to appear. <br><br>• Rapidly pressing and releasing the button multiple times will produce several smaller gray rats. <br><br>The rats produced by <i>SCP-17073</i> are non-anomalous and do not possess any special abilities or properties beyond those typically found in their respective species. After appearing, they will remain stationary until removed from their current location, at which point they will attempt to flee and seek shelter elsewhere if possible.  Attempts to damage or destroy <i>SCP-17073</i> have been unsuccessful; it remains undamaged regardless of what method is used to attempt its destruction.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17073.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a black rat produced by <i>SCP-17073</i> was found to possess an abnormally high level of intelligence. It was able to understand and respond to verbal commands, and even appeared capable of rudimentary speech. After further testing, it became clear that the rat had been exposed to a form of cognitohazardous material prior to its manifestation from <i>SCP-17073</i>; it is currently unknown where this exposure occurred or what the exact nature of the cognitohazard was. The rat has since been relocated into a secure containment chamber for further study.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17073.2 : </h3>Interview with <br>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████████<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-17073</i><br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>What can you tell me about the rats produced by this object?<br><br><b><i>SCP-17073</i>: </b>The type of rat produced depends on how the button is pressed; lightly pressing it will produce a small brown rat, pressing and holding it for five seconds will cause a large black rat to appear, and rapidly pressing and releasing it multiple times will result in several smaller gray rats appearing.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17073.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>██/██/20██ - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of pressing <i>SCP-17073</i> in various ways. The following results were <br><br><b>observed: </b><br><br>• Lightly pressing the button produced a single small brown rat.<br><br>• Pressing and holding the button down for five seconds produced a large black rat. <br><br>• Rapidly pressing and releasing the button multiple times resulted in several smaller gray rats appearing at once, with each press producing one additional rat.</div>
