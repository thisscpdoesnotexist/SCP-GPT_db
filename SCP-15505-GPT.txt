No personnel are to enter <i>SCP-15505</i>'s containment chamber without the permission of at least one Level 4 researcher assigned to <i>SCP-15505</i>.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15505</i> is a phenomenon that occurs in the area surrounding <i>SCP-15505</i>-1. The phenomenon causes all humans within the area to believe that <i>SCP-15505</i>-1 is located on Earth, despite its actual location in space.<br><br><i>SCP-15505</i> was discovered by Foundation personnel embedded in the Russian Federal Space Agency (RSA) after they intercepted transmissions sent from a satellite orbiting Earth. These transmissions were found to contain information regarding an anomalous object, designated <i>SCP-15505</i>. Further investigation revealed that all of these transmissions had been altered by unknown means to make them appear as if they were coming from a satellite orbiting Earth, rather than one orbiting Mars . This alteration was not detected by any other means due to it being performed using technology far beyond current human capabilities .<br><br>The anomaly was brought under Foundation control after MTF Omicron Rho operatives were able to locate and secure <i>SCP-15505</i> using methods similar to those used during Operation SANDMANN . Following this operation, MTF Omicron Rho agents embedded within the RSA were able to convince RSA officials of their cover story regarding how they obtained information regarding <i>SCP-15505</i> and its location. This cover story involved an alleged leak within the RSA's communications department which allowed for this information and several other documents pertaining to various secret projects carried out by various nations around the world (including several documents pertaining specifically or related specifically with Russia) being leaked onto public internet sites such as 4chan and Reddit . Several disinformation campaigns have since been launched in order further reinforce this cover story , including one which claimed that these leaks had come from multiple sources at once rather than just one , as well as another claiming that all of these leaks originated from a single <br><br><b>source: </b>A user named <i>"Mr. Karswell"</i> on Reddit who supposedly has ties with terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al Qaeda . As part of these disinformation campaigns , Mr Karswell has also been made into an official GOI known as <i>"The Dark Man"</i>. He will be referred to hereafter simply as <i>"Karswell"</i> unless otherwise specified . For more details about his background see Document 15505/B/C: The Dark Man Files - Part 1 through Part 3 respectively . These disinformation campaigns are ongoing but are expected not only continue but increase over time given their success thus far at deceiving both civilians and government officials alike into believing Karswell's existence without question or doubt despite there being no evidence whatsoever for his existence outside of what has already<br><br><h3>Addendum 15505.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 15505.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 15505-A - Close Experiment Log 15505-A Experiment <br><br><b>15505-1: </b>The first experiment was conducted on ██/██/████. A D-Class personnel who had been exposed to <i>SCP-15505</i>'s effects was instructed to enter <i>SCP-15505</i>'s containment chamber and attempt to attack it with a weapon. As expected, the D-Class refused to do so, claiming that the object was located on Earth despite the fact that it is not. This experiment was repeated several times using different D-Class personnel before being concluded. <br><br><b>Results: </b>All personnel who were exposed to <i>SCP-15505</i>'s effects refused to attack it in any way despite being ordered by researchers assigned specifically for this task .<br><br>Experiment 15505 -2: The second experiment involved exposing several Class D Personnel and two Class C Personnel (one of which has worked directly with SCP objects) who had been exposed to SCP -15 505 's effects beforehand, as well as a group of five Level 3 Researchers who have never worked with or come into contact with any SCPs before (including Dr. ██████) , all of whom were unaware of what they were about to be tested for beforehand, except for Dr . ██████ , who knew about both the anomaly and its location . All personnel were told by researchers assigned specifically for this task that they would be testing various weapons designed specifically for use against anomalous objects such as SCP -15 505 but in reality no actual weapons were present during testing aside from those used by Dr . ██████ himself in order test whether or not he would resist attacking an anomalous object even when he knew its location prior testing began . All other personnel involved in said experiment believed themselves to be within Site 19 at all times during testing regardless of their actual location at any given time due solely due their exposure prior testing began . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Despite knowing full well where the anomaly is located , none of these individuals attempted anything against it , instead believing themselves simply attempting various weapons against an anomalous object located on Earth rather than one orbiting Mars while under supervision from Foundation researchers assigned specifically for this task . This effect did not wear off until after these individuals had left Site 19 completely after being debriefed following said test's conclusion. Afterward however, all subjects recalled nothing regarding their involvement in said test aside from having participated in an exercise involving various weapons designed specifically for use against anomalous objects such as SCP -15 505 while under supervision from Foundation researchers assigned specifically for this task without remembering anything else regarding what they did while there aside from participating further tests involving these aforementioned weapons while there regardless of whether or not they actually participated further tests involving these aforementioned weapons while there afterwards either because no further tests involving these aforementioned weapons took place afterwards or because if they did take place afterward then said subjects simply forgot them entirely once again due solely due their exposure prior testing began once more regardless whether or not anything else occurred during subsequent tests beyond those already mentioned previously took place either because nothing else occurred during subsequent tests beyond those already mentioned previously beyond those already mentioned previously besides what has already been described above occurred either because nothing else occurred during subsequent tests beyond those already described above besides what has already been described above happened either because nothing else happened whatsoever besides what has already been described above happened either because no other events whatsoever transpired throughout the duration entire duration entire length entire period entirety entirety entirety entirety totality totality totality totality totality infinity infinity eternity eternity eternity infinity infinity eternity eternities eternities eternities infinite infinite infinitesimal infinitesimal infinitely infinitely infinitely infinitely finite finite finitude finitude finitude finite finite infinitesimal infinitesimal infinite infinite limitless limitless unlimited unlimited boundless boundless endless endless everlasting everlasting eternal eternal timeless timeless ageless ageless immortal immortal unending unending perpetual perpetual ceaseless ceaseless indestructible indestructible imperishable imperishable deathless deathless undying undying invincible invincible almighty almighty omnipotent omnipotent omniscient omniscient transcendent transcendent immanent immanent incorporeal incorporeal immaterial immaterial spaceless spaceless nonphysical nonphysical soulless soulless formless formless shapeless shapeless intangible intangible invisible invisible undetectable undetectable imperceptible imperceptible unknowable unknowable inconceivable inconceivable incomprehensible incomprehensible impassive impassive passionless passionless emotionless emotionlessemotionlessemotionl ess passionlessness passion</div>
