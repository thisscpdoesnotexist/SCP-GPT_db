The label depicts a human figure, assumed to be female based on the shape of its hips, wearing what appears to be a cloak or robe. The figure is facing away from the viewer and has its hands up as if it were waving at someone off screen. The text on the front reads <i>"Sunscreen for your sensitive skin! Protect yourself from harmful UV rays!"</i><br><br><i>SCP-10347</i>'s anomalous properties begin when applied to any non living organic matter (plants are not affected). When applied to any living organic matter, <i>SCP-10347</i> will cause it to become invisible (hereby referred to as <i>SCP-10347</i>-1) for an amount of time that varies depending on how much sunscreen was applied onto said object. After this period of time has passed, all traces of <i>SCP-10347</i> will disappear and all instances of <i>SCP-10347</i> will reappear in their original location before disappearing again after 24 hours have passed since reappearing. If more than one object is coated in 1034 then they will appear at different times but always within 24 hours after each other .<br><br><i>SCP-1034</i> was discovered during an investigation into several missing persons reports in ██████ , California where it was found that several people had been reported missing by their loved ones who claimed they had went outside without applying sun protection before disappearing never to be seen again . Foundation agents found bottles labeled as <i>"Sunscreen for your sensitive skin! Protect yourself from harmful UV rays!"</i> near where these people were last seen . Agents also noted that none of them seemed distressed or concerned about being outside without sun protection which led them believe that these individuals were unaware that they had been affected by an anomaly . All missing persons cases linked back to this brand have since been closed due to lack evidence linking them with further investigations into this case .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10347.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 10347.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 10347.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>10347-1: </b>D-95882 was instructed to apply <i>SCP-10347</i> onto a potted plant and then leave it outside for the next 24 hours. After 24 hours, D-95882 was instructed to retrieve the plant and bring it back into the testing chamber. Once in the testing chamber, she will be asked questions about her experience with <i>SCP-10347</i>.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-95882 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr.█████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview is an audio recording of an interview between Dr. ████ and D-95882 after she had used SCP - 1034 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr . <br><br><b>████: </b>Alright, please describe your experience with SCP - 1034 for me . D - <br><br><b>95882: </b>I did as you said doc , I applied some of that sunscreen on my plants before leaving them outside for a day . When I came back they were gone so I thought that maybe something happened to them but then when you told me about this stuff disappearing after a while , well now it makes sense why they were gone . Dr . <br><br><b>████: </b>So you didn't see anything unusual happen before or after applying this sunscreen ? (Pause) Okay, thank you very much for your cooperation , we'll be sure to keep you updated if we find anything else out about this case so don't worry okay? (D - 95882 nods) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It seems that these people are unaware of what happens when they use these bottles of sunscreen which is very strange since there's no way anyone would not notice their loved ones disappearing right in front of their eyes like that unless… unless somehow they're being affected by another anomaly which is why we need to keep looking into this case more thoroughly until we can find out what's going on here …</div>
