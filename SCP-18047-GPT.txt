Its skin is a pale pink color and it has two eyestalks protruding from the top of its head. <i>SCP-18047</i>'s behavior is that of a typical human child between the ages of three and five years old, though it does not appear to age or require sustenance.<br><br><i>SCP-18047</i> was discovered in ██████, France after reports of an <i>"unusual girl"</i> had been reported by local citizens. Upon investigation, <i>SCP-18047</i> was found living among snails in an abandoned garden shed on the outskirts of town. It appears to have been living there for some time before being discovered by Foundation personnel.<br><br>When questioned about its origin, <i>SCP-18047</i> claims to have once been a snail but was transformed into its current form through unknown means at some point prior to being discovered by Foundation personnel. It also states that it cannot remember anything prior to becoming what it is now, nor can it explain how or why this transformation occurred; attempts at further interrogation have proven unsuccessful due to <i>SCP-18047</i>'s apparent lack of understanding regarding such topics as well as its limited vocabulary and general shyness when discussing them with strangers (see Addendum 18047A).<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18047</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. It is to be provided with basic amenities such as clothing, bedding, and toys appropriate for its age.<br><br>Personnel interacting with <i>SCP-18047</i> are to maintain a calm and friendly demeanor at all times; any attempts at aggression or intimidation will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action. Personnel are also reminded that <i>SCP-18047</i>'s transformation was likely caused by unknown means, so any attempts at reversing it should not be attempted without prior approval from the Site Director.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18047.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/████, a research team was dispatched to the location where <i>SCP-18047</i> was initially discovered. Upon investigation, they discovered a large number of snails in the garden shed, as well as several empty snail shells which appeared to have been recently vacated. Analysis of these shells revealed that they had all been inhabited by snails at some point prior to <i>SCP-18047</i>'s transformation into its current form.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18047.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18047</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-18047</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18047</i>.
