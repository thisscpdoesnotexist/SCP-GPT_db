No personnel are allowed to listen to <i>SCP-10084</i>, and any personnel that have listened to it are not allowed within 100 meters of the object.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10084</i> is an instance of a MIDI file titled <i>"The Song That Never Ends.mid"</i>. The song itself is around 2 minutes and 15 seconds long, and contains the lyrics <i>"Oh no, it's happening again! I'm turning inside out!"</i> repeated over and over.<br><br><i>SCP-10084</i>'s anomalous effects manifest when any human subject listens to it for more than 30 seconds. After this time has passed, the subject will begin to experience intense nausea and disorientation, as well as a feeling of being constantly watched by an unknown entity. After one minute has passed since exposure began, the subject will begin to undergo physical changes that are consistent with being turned inside out. These changes include:<br><br>Disintegration of internal organs in reverse order from head to toe; starting with their heart, then lungs/liver/intestines/etc., ending with their brain at which point they die instantly<br><br>Turning into a liquid substance that flows in reverse order from toes to head; starting with their toes and ending at their head where they solidify into flesh once again (this process takes around 5 minutes) This process can be stopped if the affected individual is killed before 1 minute has passed since exposure began (see Addendum 10084-1). If not killed within this timeframe, then <i>SCP-10084</i>'s effects cannot be reversed short of killing them before 5 minutes have elapsed after exposure begins (see Addendum 10084-2).<br><br><h3>Addendum 10084.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> D-81448, a Class-D personnel that was exposed to <i>SCP-10084</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>D-81448 was exposed to <i>SCP-10084</i> for 1 minute before being terminated by security personnel. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>What were you doing when you were exposed? <br><br><b>D-81448: </b>I was just listening to it, like the instructions told me to do. It sounded like some kind of weird song at first but then I started feeling really sick and disoriented and then I couldn't see anything except for this bright light, so I closed my eyes but it didn't help at all… (Subject begins coughing up blood) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Please continue with your account of what happened after the effects manifested themselves in you. <br><br><b>D-81448: </b>It's hard to remember…I don't think about it very often because it makes me feel sick just thinking about it…but anyway, everything started getting dark around me and there were these voices in my head telling me how disgusting I am and how they're going to make sure that no one ever loves or cares about me again…and then they started talking about all the ways they're going torture me until I die a slow death… (Subject begins sobbing) <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>You are not alone now; we are here with you now so please tell us what happened next after hearing those voices in your head! We need as much information as possible if we're going stop this thing from hurting anyone else! (Subject continues sobbing for several minutes before responding.) <br><br><b>D-81448: </b>…so they said that they would kill everyone who ever loved or cared about me first because they knew that would hurt more than anything else if someone close to them died before my eyes while knowing that I'm still alive somewhere out there suffering too….and then things got really blurry but somehow everything went back into place again only backwards; like when something goes through a mirror backwards—I know this sounds crazy but trust me on this one—it's true! So everything went back into place only backwards and then suddenly my brain fell out of my mouth followed by every other organ inside of my body which is when the pain stopped….then there was nothing left inside of me anymore except for some sort of black liquid stuff which flowed outwards from every pore on my body until nothing was left except for skin covering bones which solidified into flesh once again…..and then suddenly everything turned white around me and there were these people standing over where I used be; their faces looked familiar somehow even though none of them seemed familiar at all….they asked if anyone had seen <i>"me"</i> anywhere nearby recently since <i>"he"</i> had gone missing earlier today……they said his name over and over again while looking right through where <i>"I"</i> used be…… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After an autopsy revealed no traces whatsoever indicating that any organs or fluids belonging within an internal human anatomy had been present inside Subject 81448 prior's remains, Subject 81448's remains have been designated as SCP 10084 -1A . Further testing is required regarding whether or not any other instances exist within Foundation custody containing traces belonging within an internal human anatomy .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10084.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-10084-1 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-10084-1 is to listen to <i>SCP-10084</i> for 30 seconds. <br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected, subject began experiencing the effects of <i>SCP-10084</i> immediately after exposure began. After 30 seconds had passed, subject was instructed to stop listening to the file and report any changes. Subject reported that they were <i>"feeling a little sick"</i> but otherwise did not feel any different. <br><br><b>Notes: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-10084</i>'s effects do not manifest if exposure lasts less than 30 seconds. - Dr ██████ Experiment #: 2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-10123 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-10123 is instructed to listen to <i>SCP-10084</i> until it has played for exactly 5 minutes without interruption or termination of the song by Foundation personnel (see Addendum 10084). <br><br><b>Results: </b>As expected, subject began experiencing the effects of <i>SCP-10084</i> immediately after exposure began, and reported feeling as if they were being watched by an unknown entity before one minute had passed since exposure started (see Addendum 10085). After 2 minutes had passed since exposure started, subject reported that their body was beginning to undergo physical changes consistent with being turned inside out in reverse order from head to toe; starting with their toes and ending at their head where they solidify into flesh once again (see Addendum 10086). At 3 minutes and 10 seconds since exposure started, subject's brain disintegrated completely and died instantly as a result of this process; however this process could be stopped if the affected individual was killed before 1 minute had passed since exposure began (see Addendum 10087). If not killed within this timeframe then it would be impossible short of killing them before 5 minutes have elapsed after exposure begins for them or anyone else in proximity with them from hearing <i>SCP-10088</i>'s anomalous effects manifest (See Addendum 10088) .<br><br></div>
