<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19998 is  The existence of parmesan cheese</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19998<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19998</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that causes the existence of parmesan cheese to become a reality. Whenever any form of parmesan cheese is mentioned, described or otherwise referenced, it will manifest in the immediate vicinity with no known source. The type of cheese varies depending on the context in which it was referenced, ranging from freshly grated parmesan to pre-packaged varieties.<br><br>The manifestation of <i>SCP-19998</i> appears to be limited by its proximity to a human subject; if there are no humans present within a 20 meter radius, then no parmesan cheese will appear. Additionally, any newly manifested instances of <i>SCP-19998</i> will immediately begin decaying and become inedible after approximately one hour has passed since their initial manifestation.<br><br>Attempts at containing this anomaly have been unsuccessful due to its unpredictable nature and lack of physical presence; as such, all personnel are advised against mentioning anything related to parmesan cheese while on site or near any Foundation facilities.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-19998</i>, containment is not possible. All personnel are advised against mentioning anything related to parmesan cheese while on site or near any Foundation facilities.
