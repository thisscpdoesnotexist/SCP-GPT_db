The containment chamber is to be guarded by 2 armed guards at all times and the door must remain locked at all times unless testing is being performed on <i>SCP-14470</i>.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14470</i> is a bookshelf with an angelic soul. <i>SCP-14470</i> was discovered after reports of an <i>"angel"</i> were reported in ██████, Iowa. <i>SCP-14470</i> will attempt to lure people into entering its containment chamber by reading to them from various books it has on the shelf. If someone enters its containment chamber, <i>SCP-14470</i> will try to make them read the book it is holding and if they refuse or try to leave, <i>SCP-14470</i> will attack them by slamming the book onto their head repeatedly until they are incapacitated or dead.<br><br><i>SCP-14470</i> was originally contained in a small library in ██████, Iowa before being moved to Site 17 for research purposes. While in storage at Site 17, D-Class personnel attempted multiple times to enter its containment chamber but were unsuccessful due to the fact that <i>SCP-14470</i> had no books on its shelf at that time of testing and could not lure anyone into entering its containment chamber. After this incident occurred several times over a period of 2 months, Drs. ████ and ███████ decided that they would move all of the books off of <i>SCP-1447</i>'s shelf so that it would not be able to lure anyone into entering its containment chamber again while being stored at Site 17 and put up signs around it <br><br><b>stating: </b><i>"SCP <br><br><b>Foundation: </b>Please do not feed or play with any SCPs."</i><br><br>After this incident occurred several more times over a period of 2 months, Drs. ████ and ███████ decided that they would move all of the books off of SCP's 1447's shelf so that it would not be able t o lure anyone into entering its containment chamber again while being stored at Site 17 . They also put up signs around it <br><br><b>stating: </b><i>"Do Not Feed Or Play With Any SCPs"</i>. This did not stop D class personnel from attempting t o get close enough t o touch or interact with any Keter class objects during transportation for testing purposes . This caused several Keter class objects t o become uncontained as well as other Safe/Euclid/Keter class objects during transport because D Class Personnel were trying t o get close enough t o touch or interact with these objects during transport for testing purposes .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14470.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-14470</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14470</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Hello <i>SCP-14470</i>, how are you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14470</i>: </b>I'm fine, thank you for asking. <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>What is your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-14470</i>: </b>My name is Sarah and I am an angel of the lord, with a message from God himself to tell all of mankind that he loves them very much and wants them to be happy and safe in this world. Drs. ████████ and █████████ enter the room at this point in time with several D class personnel behind them carrying books off of its shelf . D class personnel begin placing books back on its shelf as they talk . After several minutes pass by, one of the D class personnel attempts to leave but is stopped by one of the armed guards standing outside of its containment chamber . The guard then tells the D class personnel t o get back inside before closing the door behind him . After several more minutes pass by , one of the armed guards leaves his post at his post outside o f SCP's 1447's containment chamber just long enough for a D Class Personnel t o sneak up behind him while he was talking to another guard about something unrelated t o their current situation right now , grab his gun out from under his arm , pull it out from under his arm while pointing it at one of th e other guards , put it against their head (the head being protected by a helmet) and pull [REDACTED] causing both guards t o fall unconscious onto th e floor . This caused all 3 armed guards outside [REDACTED] containment chamber to be unconscious which allowed 2 other D Class Personnel who were standing nearby watching what was happening unfold right now on 2 separate surveillance cameras that were placed around Site 17's main lobby area (which was not being watched due to recent budget cuts) t o run into Site 17's main lobby area where they grabbed guns from 2 additional security officers who were also knocked unconscious during this incident as well as 1 researcher who was not wearing any form of body armor or protection whatsoever because she thought she would be safe inside her office which has been proven wrong multiple times over a period over 4 years since she started working here due do her lack luster performance here at Site 17 since day 1 when she first started working here while wearing no form body armor or protection whatsoever allowing her too b e taken hostage along with everyone else in Site 17 's main lobby area including every single Keter level object currently stored within Site 17 's main vault located deep underneath site ground level which forced all remaining Foundation staff members stationed within site17 underground facility too evacuate into site17 underground facility deep below ground level where they locked themselves inside until further notice after calling O5 command center informing them about what happened so far during this incident including every single Keter level object currently stored within S i te 17 ' s m ain vault located deep underneath site ground level forcing O5 Command Center too send an MTF unit consisting out 10 heavily armored MTF units equipped wit h heavy weaponry such as assault rifles/shotguns/rocket launchers/etc., 5 heavily armored MTF units equipped with anti tank weaponry such as anti tank rocket launchers/anti tank mines/anti tank grenades etc., 5 highly trained combat specialists equipped wit h high powered tranquilizer rifles capable o f knocking out anything up too keter class objects without killing them instantly via putting darts filled w it h sedatives made specifically for knocking out keter class objects directly into their bloodstream via shooting these darts directly into their skin via tranquilizer rifle causing everything inside Site 1 7 including every single Safe /Euclid /Keter object currently stored there including every single Safe /Euclid /Keter object currently stored there unable t o move due do being knocked unconscious almost instantly upon getting shot w ith these tranquilizer darts filled w ith sedatives made specifically for knocking out k et er objects directly into their bloodstream via shooting these darts directly into their skin via tranquilizer rifle once again proving why we should never let anyone besides trained Foundation personal handle any sort if firearms especially when dealing wit h K et er classes objects even if said firearms are only loaded w i th non lethal ammunition designed only for capturing said K et er classes objects alive instead causeing harm towards anyone else besides said K et er classes objects once again proving why we should never let anyone besides trained Foundation personal<br><br><h3>Addendum 14470.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log 14470.1 - Close Log <br><br><b>Date: </b>11/14/████<br><br><b>Experimenter: </b>Dr. ████<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14470<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-14470 was instructed to enter <i>SCP-14470</i>'s containment chamber and touch the bookshelf while being observed by Dr. ████ from behind a one way mirror.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After D-14470 entered the room, <i>SCP-14470</i> began reading to him from a book it was holding .
