Any individuals who enter <i>SCP-14993</i> are to be apprehended and questioned, then administered Class-A amnestics before being released.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14993</i> is a series of elevators in Site-███. <i>SCP-14993</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual enters any of the elevators and presses the button for a floor that does not exist. All individuals who enter <i>SCP-14993</i> are transported to a previously unknown floor in Site-███, designated Floor 14993.<br><br><i>SCP-14993</i> was discovered after three maintenance workers entered an elevator and pressed the button for Floor -1, which did not exist at the time. The workers were transported to Floor 14993 and were found unconscious by security guards on patrol duty. After being revived, all three claimed to have experienced <i>"a feeling of vertigo"</i> before blacking out.<br><br><i>SCP-14993</i> was then brought under containment after it was discovered that no other floors existed between -1 and 13 (the highest numbered floor at the time). Testing has shown that there is no difference between Floors 13 and 14993 except for their position relative to Earth's surface (i.e., one is above ground while one below). The Foundation has since constructed several more floors between -1 and 13 using materials from different sources such as stone, steel, concrete, etc., but all attempts have failed; none of these new floors have been added to Site maps or included in blueprints or plans for future construction projects despite being fully functional otherwise . It should be noted that this only applies to newly constructed floors; existing ones can still be accessed normally through standard means .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14993.2 : </h3>Interview with   <i>SCP-14993</i>-1<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14993</i>-1 </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is the transcript of an interview between Dr. ██████ and <i>SCP-14993</i>-1, who was found unconscious in Floor 14993 shortly after it was discovered by security personnel. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, can you hear me? [<i>SCP-14993</i>-1 does not respond] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello? I know that you can hear me; I can see your eyes moving under your eyelids! Are you awake? [<i>SCP-14993</i> begins to stir] <br><br><b><i>SCP-14993</i>: </b>Where am I? Who are you people?! What happened to me?! [Dr. ██████ motions for one of the guards to approach and help <i>SCP-149931</i> up] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>You're in a secure facility at Site -███; we found you unconscious in Floor 1499—I mean, Floor -1 earlier today when three workers entered the elevator by mistake and pressed the button for -1 instead of 13 . Can you tell us what happened after they pressed the button? [SCP stands up on its own accord before speaking] SCP: Well, first they all screamed <i>"Oh my God"</i> or something like that before pressing every button on their keypads at once . Then there was this bright flash of light , then I woke up here! Oh wait… no… no… no… oh my God ! No ! Noooooo !!! [At this point, security personnel restrain SCP from harming itself with its restraints.] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After calming down again , further questioning revealed that prior to entering an elevator on Floor 13 , all three workers had experienced similar <i>"flashes"</i> accompanied by loud noises while working near elevators throughout Site -███ (see Addendum 14993.3). It is currently unknown whether these flashes were caused by anomalous activity or if they were simply coincidental occurrences resulting from maintenance work being performed nearby .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14993.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 14993-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14993, male, 30 years old.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject instructed to enter <i>SCP-14993</i> and press the button for Floor -1. Subject complied and was transported to Floor 14993. After a few minutes of observation, subject was instructed to return to normal floor by pressing the button for Floor 13 (the highest floor at the time). Subject complied and returned successfully without incident.<br><br><b>Results: </b>No anomalous properties noted .<br><br>Experiment Log 14993-2:</div>
