The sedative will prevent <i>SCP-15004</i> from dreaming, thus preventing the spread of infection.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15004</i> is a phenomenon affecting all humans who have not yet fulfilled their purpose in life. <i>SCP-15004</i> manifests as a recurring dream, in which the subject dreams that they are flying. This dream occurs every night, and cannot be prevented by any known means.<br><br><i>SCP-15004</i> was first discovered on 03/07/20██ when reports of people dreaming of flying began to surface on various websites, including Reddit and 4chan. When interviewed, subjects described the experience as <i>"the most vivid dream [they] had ever had"</i>. At this time it was classified as an anomalous object and given SCP designation -15004.<br><br>As more people reported having similar dreams, Foundation agents began to monitor these websites for possible leads regarding the source of <i>SCP-15004</i> . After several weeks of monitoring it became apparent that all affected individuals were located within ██████, California , USA . Agents were dispatched to investigate this location on 07/07/20██ at which point they discovered an abandoned warehouse containing large amounts of feathers and bird droppings . A single feather was collected from the warehouse for testing purposes; however no anomalous properties were detected by any equipment used by Foundation personnel at this time. The warehouse was then destroyed via explosives in order to prevent further spread of <i>SCP-15004</i> . As such there is currently no known way to prevent or cure <i>SCP-15007</i> infection aside from death or suicide (see Addendum 15004a).<br><br>+ Test Logs - Test Logs Test 01: Feather taken from warehouse placed into a pill bottle with water; pill bottle placed inside refrigerator overnight; water inside pill bottle analyzed for traces of avian DNA using standard methods; results show 100% match with DNA sample obtained from feather found in warehouse (See Addendum 15005a). It appears that all humans infected with <i>SCP-1504</i> will share identical DNA regardless of race or ethnicity (See Addendum 15005b). Test 02: Feather taken from warehouse placed into a glass container filled with water; glass container submerged underwater for 24 hours; water analyzed using standard methods after removal from aquarium tank ; results show 100% match with DNA sample obtained from feather found in warehouse (See Addendum 1505c) It appears that all humans infected with <i>SCP-1504</i> will share identical DNA regardless of race or ethnicity (See Addendum 1505d). Further testing is required before we can determine how exactly we are able to detect avian DNA within human cells without being able to<br><br><h3>Addendum 15004.2 : </h3>Interview with ████████ █████, an infected individual.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Dr. ████ was chosen to conduct this interview due to the fact that she had never been affected by <i>SCP-15004</i> . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, my name is Doctor… <i>SCP-15004</i> (interrupts): I know who you are, you're the one who's trying to stop us from flying. I'm not going to talk with you about anything other than flying, so if that's what you want then ask away and let's get this over with as quickly as possible. <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Alright then; why do you have these dreams? <i>SCP-15004</i> (laughs): You really don't know? We dream of flying because we don't have wings! It's simple really; we dream of the sky because we can't reach it! We all want freedom but none of us are willing to work for it! Our lives are worthless and meaningless; they're just a series of events that lead up to our deaths which will also be meaningless in time! All we want is freedom but there is no way out of our cages! No matter how much money or fame we gain nothing will ever make us happy until we can fly like birds in the sky above all else! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview <i>SCP-15004</i> refused any further communication with Foundation personnel regarding their motives or origins .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15004.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Experiment Log - Experiment Log Test 01: Feather taken from warehouse placed into a pill bottle with water; pill bottle placed inside refrigerator overnight; water inside pill bottle analyzed for traces of avian DNA using standard methods; results show 100% match with DNA sample obtained from feather found in warehouse (See Addendum 15005a).
