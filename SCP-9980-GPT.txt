<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9980</i> is sentient, contagious frostbite that makes you think you're a superhero.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9980</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9980</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All personnel interacting with <i>SCP-9980</i> must wear Level A hazmat suits at all times, and are not permitted to remove them until they have been decontaminated.<br><br>All staff interacting with <i>SCP-9980</i> must be screened for infection by <i>SCP-9980</i> before entering the containment chamber. Any staff found to be infected are to be immediately removed from contact with <i>SCP-9980</i> and placed into quarantine until such time as a cure can be developed (See Addendum).<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9980</i> is an anomalous condition that affects the skin of humans. <i>SCP-9980</i> manifests as a form of frostbite, with symptoms appearing on the skin in the shape of various superhero logos and symbols.<br><br><i>SCP-9980</i> spreads by physical contact with an infected subject, or through direct exposure to wind carrying <i>SCP-9980</i> particles. The infection rate has been shown to be proportional to the amount of time spent exposed; however, it is unknown whether this relationship is linear or exponential. Once infected, subjects will begin to believe they are a specific superhero (See Addendum). It should be noted that no two subjects have been infected by <i>SCP-9980</i> and believed themselves to be the same character.<br><br>Subjects will claim their powers are based on their own physical abilities and experience; however, testing has shown that these claims are inaccurate and inconsistent with reality (See Addendum). Subjects also display no control over any anomalous properties they may possess; instead these powers act autonomously from their host's consciousness. Testing has revealed that there appears to be no limit on what powers can manifest from <i>SCP-9980</i> infection; however, all subjects have demonstrated superhuman strength , speed , durability , reflexes , stamina , agility , coordination , balance and endurance . Additionally, all infected individuals have demonstrated some form of telepathic communication . It should also be noted that while all subjects demonstrate some form of superpowers after infection by <i>SCP-9980</i> it does not appear necessary for them to retain any level of superhuman ability for them to continue believing themselves as such during interviews or tests (See Addendum).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9980.2 : </h3>Interview with ùîÖùî¶ùî§ùî± ùîûùî©ùî¨<br><br>+ Interview Log 9980.2 - close log <br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-9980</i>, who claims to be <i>"The Flash"</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9980</i>'s containment, and was the first time it had been exposed to any other living human being since its initial recovery. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: </b>Hello, I'm here to ask you some questions about yourself. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9980</i>: </b>What? Uh‚Ä¶ sure? <br><br><b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: </b>Do you know where you are? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9980</i>: </b>Uh‚Ä¶ this is Site 19 right? Are you guys like scientists or something? <br><br><b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: </b>Yes, we're scientists; although not exactly the kind of scientist you may be used to seeing on TV or in comic books . Anyway, could you tell me your name for the record please? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9980</i>: </b>Oh! Sure! I'm The Flash! You can call me Barry if that's easier for ya'. <br><br><b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: </b>Thankyou Mr‚Ä¶ Barry . Could you tell me what your abilities are please? I'd like a list of everything that makes up your powers so we can get a better idea of how they work and maybe even find out how they came about in the first place if possible.. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9980</i>: </b>Sure thing Doc! It's pretty easy actually; all my powers come from my super speed ! That's why I have super reflexes , agility , endurance , strength and stuff too right?! So basically when people see me runin' around they think 'wow that guy must have some awesome powers!' but really it all comes down to plain old speed ! It's kinda disappointing really; no one ever thinks about how hard it is just running around at those speeds all day long without stopping or getting tired . Plus there's no way anyone could keep up with me at those speeds unless they were also fast enough themselves‚Ä¶ which isn't very likely now is it?! Haha! Anyway uh sorry Doctor did ya' want anything else from me before we move onto another subject ? Sorry if this wasn't very helpful but uh yeah that pretty much covers everything important about my power set doesn't it?! <br><br><b>Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: </b>No need to apologize Mr‚Ä¶. Barry ; thankyou for your time (<i>SCP-9980</i> exits room.) Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>As expected infection by <i>SCP-990</i> causes subjects to believe themselves as superheroes based on their own personal abilities and experiences rather than actual reality (See Addendum). Additionally while testing has shown that these claims are inaccurate and inconsistent with reality (See Addendum) infected subjects continue believing them regardless of any contradictory evidence presented during interviews or tests (See Addendum). While further research into this phenomenon is required before any attempt at treatment can be made (see Addendum), current research indicates that treating infected individuals as though they possess actual superhuman abilities will result in them continuing their belief system without issue provided said individuals do not encounter information suggesting otherwise . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing Statement II:: Due to his unique ability among test subjects infected by 9990 Mr‚Ä¶. Barry has been selected as a potential candidate for future experimentation into curing 9990 infection using various forms of therapy including exposure therapy , cognitive behavioral therapy , hypnotherapy etcetera etcetera ‚Ä¶...</div>
