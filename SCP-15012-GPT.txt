Testing with <i>SCP-15012</i> is currently prohibited.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15012</i> is a standard Red Delicious apple core, which appears to have been bitten from.<br><br><i>SCP-15012</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is consumed by a human subject. After consuming <i>SCP-15012</i>, the subject will begin to experience auditory and visual hallucinations in the form of images and sounds of an unknown entity. These hallucinations will continue for approximately 1 hour before ceasing altogether. After this period has elapsed, the subject will then go through a process which has been described as <i>"reverse digestion"</i>. This process involves the subject's body being dissolved into their constituent molecules over the course of approximately 2 hours, after which their body will reform itself back into its original state with all previous injuries healed.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15012.2 : </h3>Interview with █.█, who consumed <i>SCP-15012</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █.█ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview took place after █.█ consumed <i>SCP-15012</i> and experienced the effects of its anomalous properties, along with several other D-class personnel for testing purposes. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Alright, can you describe what you saw? <br><br><b>D-14461: </b>It was a… a big thing, I guess? It looked like it was made out of shadows and had claws that were like knives or something… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>And what did it do to you? D-14461 pauses for approximately 2 seconds before responding in an agitated manner . <br><br><b>D-14461: </b>It cut me up! Like it was slicing my insides up! I could feel my body being ripped apart! Then I just fell apart into these little pieces, then they all came back together again! Dr.: Can you remember anything else about the entity? Where it came from or where it went afterwards?<br><br>D-14461 pauses once more before replying .<br><br>D-14461 appears visibly shaken throughout the duration of this interview .<br><br>D - 14 4 6 1: No… no idea where it came from or went after that… I just remember waking up in here and thinking <i>"What happened to me?"</i> …I'm gonna go now… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview took place, SCP personnel were sent to retrieve <i>SCP-15012</i> from D - 14 4 6 1 's containment locker and found that he had spontaneously combusted shortly after the conclusion of this interview . Further testing with SCP - 15 012 has been suspended until further notice .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15012.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-15012-1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-81234, a 32 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-81234 was instructed to consume <i>SCP-15012</i> and report any auditory or visual hallucinations. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After consuming <i>SCP-15012</i>, D-81234 reported experiencing auditory hallucinations in the form of <i>"a high pitched whining noise"</i>. He also reported experiencing visual hallucinations in the form of <i>"bright flashing lights"</i> for approximately 1 hour before both ceased altogether. After this period had elapsed, his body began to dissolve into its constituent molecules over the course of approximately 2 hours, after which it reformed itself back into its original state with all previous injuries healed. <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It is currently unknown as to whether or not <i>SCP-15012</i>'s effects can be negated by other means than reversing the process through which they manifest themselves. Experiment 15012/2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-81234, a 32 year old Caucasian male. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A sample of DNA belonging to Dr Clef was obtained and used in place of that belonging to D - 81234 . <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon consuming SCP - 15011 , Dr Clef immediately spat out said apple core onto the floor and proceeded to vomit profusely for several minutes before collapsing onto his back on the floor afterwards . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that any human subject who consumes an instance of SCP - 15012 will experience similar effects as those experienced by Dr Clef when he consumed an instance of SCP - 15010 . Experiment 1501 2 / 3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A sample containing DNA belonging 100% pure ██████████ brand apple juice was obtained from Site - 19 's cafeteria and replaced with a sample containing DNA belonging 100% pure ██████ brand apple juice instead . The resulting product was then placed into a standard containment locker at Site 19 's cafeteria , where it would remain until consumed by one ( 1 ) randomly selected member from MTF Iota - 10 (<i>"Damn Feds"</i>). <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon consuming said beverage , Agent ███ immediately spat out said beverage onto the floor and proceeded to vomit profusely for several minutes before collapsing onto his back on the floor afterwards . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that any human subject who consumes an instance of SCP - 150 12 will experience similar effects as those experienced by Agent ███ when he consumed an instance ofSCP—150 10 . Experiment 150 12 / 4 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>A sample containing DNA belonging 100 % pure [DATA EXPUNGED] brand apple juice was obtained from Site 19 's cafeteria and replaced with a sample containing DNA belonging 100% pure [DATA EXPUNGED] brand apple juice instead . The resulting product was then placed into a standard containment locker at Site 19's cafeteria , where it would remain until consumed by one ( 1 ) randomly selected member from MTF Iota — 10 (<i>"Damn Feds"</i>). <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon consuming said beverage , Agent █████ immediately spat out said beverage ontothefloorand proceeded toproceedto vomitprofuselyforseveralminutesbeforecollapsingontohisbackonthefloorafterwards <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that any human subject who consumes an instanceofSCP—150 12 willexperiencesimilareffectsasthoseexperiencedbyAgent██whenheconsumedaninstanceofSCP—150 11</div>
