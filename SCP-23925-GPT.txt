<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-23925 is  an event where Mitch McConnell froze in the middle of a press conference before releasing hundreds of spiders from his mouth</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-23925<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-23925</i> is an anomalous event that occurs when Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader of the United States of America, speaks publicly. When he begins speaking, his body will freeze in place and a swarm of spiders will emerge from his mouth. These spiders are non-anomalous and appear to be normal arachnids native to Kentucky.<br><br>Once released, the spiders will disperse throughout the area or remain on McConnell's person if he is stationary. The amount of spiders released appears to vary depending on how long McConnell has been speaking for; it has been observed that longer speeches result in larger swarms being released.<br><br>The effects of <i>SCP-23925</i> can be mitigated by using a microphone with noise cancellation technology or by having someone speak over McConnell while he is frozen mid-speech; this appears to prevent further spider emergence from occurring. However, it does not stop any previously existing swarms from dispersing throughout the area or reassembling around him afterwards. <br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-23925</i>, it is impossible to contain. As such, personnel are to monitor McConnell's public appearances and be prepared to respond accordingly if an instance of <i>SCP-23925</i> occurs. <br><br>In the event that an instance of <i>SCP-23925</i> does occur, personnel are to immediately deploy insecticide in order to neutralize any spiders released from McConnell's mouth. Personnel should also attempt to locate and capture any surviving spiders for further study. <br><br>Once all instances of <i>SCP-23925</i> have been contained or neutralized, personnel are then instructed to administer a Class A amnestic on all witnesses present at the event in order prevent knowledge of this anomaly from spreading.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23925.1: </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, an instance of <i>SCP-23925</i> occurred during a press conference held by McConnell in Washington D.C. Approximately 200 spiders were released from his mouth before personnel were able to contain the situation. All witnesses present at the event were administered amnestics and no further instances of <i>SCP-23925</i> have been reported since then.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23925.2: </h3> Interview with McConnell<br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> Mitch McConnell <br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me what happened the last time <i>SCP-23925</i> occurred? <br><b>Mitch McConnell:</b> I don't remember much, but I do recall freezing in place and feeling something coming out of my mouth. It was like a swarm of spiders or something… it was really strange. <br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you know why this is happening? <br><b>Mitch McConnell:</b> No, I don't have any idea why this is happening. It's never happened before and it's really frightening to me that it keeps occurring. <br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Do you have any theories as to why this is happening?<br><b>Mitch McConnell:</b> No, I don't. It's a complete mystery to me.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23925.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 23925.3-1:</b> <br><b>Subject:</b> One (1) live spider from a swarm released during an instance of <i>SCP-23925</i>. <br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was placed in a sealed containment chamber and observed for any anomalous behavior. <br><b>Results:</b> Subject did not display any anomalous behavior and appeared to be a normal arachnid. After two weeks, the subject expired due to natural causes.</div>
