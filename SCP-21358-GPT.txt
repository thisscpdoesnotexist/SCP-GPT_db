<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21358 is  the mystery of e621</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21358<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21358</i> is a phenomenon that occurs in the online imageboard e621.net, wherein certain images posted on the site will cause anomalous effects when viewed by users. Upon viewing these images, viewers will experience an intense feeling of dread and fear, followed by a sudden disappearance of all memories related to the image or its contents. The affected user will not be able to recall any details about the image or its contents after this period of amnesia has passed.<br><br>The phenomenon appears to be limited to only certain images posted on e621; it does not appear to affect other websites or forms of media. Additionally, no two instances are identical; each instance affects different people in different ways and with varying intensity. It is unknown what causes this effect or how it functions; however, research suggests that there may be some form of memetic property at work here.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the unpredictable nature of <i>SCP-21358</i>, containment is impossible. All personnel are advised to avoid viewing any images posted on e621 that appear to be anomalous in nature. Additionally, all personnel are encouraged to report any instances of <i>SCP-21358</i> they encounter so that further research can be conducted into its effects and possible containment measures.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21358.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an instance of <i>SCP-21358</i> was encountered by a Foundation researcher who had been browsing the e621 website. Upon viewing the anomalous image, the researcher experienced an intense feeling of dread and fear before all memories related to it were erased from their mind.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 21358.2: </h3> Interview with a Subject Affected by <i>SCP-21358</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-91245<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Please state your name and identification number for the record.<br><b><br>D-91245:</b> My name is [REDACTED], and my ID number is D-91245.<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Thank you, [REDACTED]. Can you tell me what happened when you viewed the image in question?<br><b><br>D-91245:</b> Well, I was browsing through e621 like I usually do, and I came across this one image that caught my eye. It was… strange, almost like it was out of place compared to the other images on the site. So I clicked on it to take a closer look… and then everything went blank after that point. It was like I had forgotten what I was looking at, or even why I was on the site in the first place. It was really weird.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21358.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>The following is a record of experiments conducted in an attempt to further understand the nature of <i>SCP-21358</i>. All tests were conducted with D-class personnel, and all results are reported accordingly.<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> Subject was presented with an image posted on e621 that had been identified as anomalous. Upon viewing the image, subject immediately began to experience intense feelings of fear and dread, followed by a period of amnesia lasting roughly 30 seconds. After this period had passed, subject was unable to recall any details about the image or its contents.<br><b><br>Test 2:</b> Subject was presented with another anomalous image from e621; however, this time they were instructed not to look directly at it but instead focus on something else in the room while still being aware of its presence. Results indicated that no anomalous effects occurred; subject experienced only mild discomfort when asked about their memories related to the image after viewing it for several minutes without looking directly at it.</div>
