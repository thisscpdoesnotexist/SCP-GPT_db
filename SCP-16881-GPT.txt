When i arrived i saw that the movie was not at all like the godzilla movies i have seen before and decided to make a new one based on what people wanted out of a godzilla film . <br><br><b>Dr.█████: </b>So what exactly did they want? <br><br><b><i>SCP-16881</i>: </b>They wanted more giant monster fights , bigger explosions and more destruction overall . So after looking through many different Godzilla films i decided to make one with lots of monster action but also with some human drama thrown into it as well so that people could relate to it more , plus if you don't give them explosions or destruction they will just say its boring which is something we definitely don't want happening here do we ? After a few months we finished filming and released our new film on DVD and Blu ray discs which are still available today if anyone wants them although personally i would recommend watching our VHS copy if possible since its much better quality than any other version . We also made sure that no matter what device someone watches our movie on they will always get the same experience as every other person watching it which is why we made sure that all copies were compatible with both VHS tapes and DVDs or blu rays discs as well as any other devices capable of playing those formats such as streaming sites or online stores however only physical copies are available right now due to bandwidth issues but don't worry these issues should be fixed soon enough thanks to [REDACTED] technology allowing us to compress multiple copies onto one disc without losing too much quality during playback while still keeping everything else just like how its supposed to be seen by everyone else who has watched our film before hand no matter where they are located in the world really makes things easier for us filmmakers nowadays doesn’t it ? <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing this interview, staff have determined that 16882 has been viewed 6 times by 6 different individuals prior being contained by foundation personnel resulting in all viewers speaking japanese even though none were native speakers prior viewing 16882 regardless of their location at time time including locations outside Japan where japanese is not commonly spoken such as North America or Europe despite having never previously learned japanese nor ever having visited Japan before viewing said anomaly suggesting an external force influencing viewers decisions regarding whether or not they watch another copy after viewing one themselves instead of making said decisions independently possibly causing them harm when attempting playback using non normal means<br><br><h3>Addendum 16881.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Experiment-16881-1: </b>D-8674 is a 32 year old caucasian male. D-8674 has never seen any godzilla movies before and was chosen to be the first test subject for <i>SCP-16881</i>. Subject was instructed to place <i>SCP-16881</i> into a standard VHS player and press play. After pressing play, the screen goes black for approximately 2 minutes before showing an image of what would be expected from an unplayed VHS tape with no audio or video output being produced while displaying this image . After this, D-8674 began speaking japanese even if he did not speak japanese normally unless he watched at least one Godzilla film beforehand , this effect lasted until the end of his life or until he watched another Godzilla film which ever comes first . This effect also applies if someone watches another copy of 16882 after watching one themselves , though this time only lasting for as long as both copies are being watched simultaneously . Once these effects wear off completely all memories gained from viewing either 16882 are lost immediately afterwards , although some people report having dreams about them afterwards regardless . Any other attempts at viewing 16882 result in nothing happening except for audio distortion similar to that heard when attempting playback on non compatible devices with no visual distortions taking place however these attempts still count towards how many times you have viewed 16882 allowing you access its anomalous properties so long as you don't exceed 6 times total (including attempted viewings).

When asked why they were speaking Japanese they said “I don’t know I just feel like I should” then proceeded to watch another copy of SCP -16881 after saying “it feels like something is pulling me towards it” despite having not been told that it would allow them access to its anomalous properties more than once<br><br></div>
