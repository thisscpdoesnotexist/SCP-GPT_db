It appears to be made of wood and is inscribed with various patterns and symbols associated with the ancient Sumerian culture, though some have been altered or destroyed. The gate leads to a large open field containing several hundred used cars of various makes, models, years and conditions as well as several dozen car salesmen.<br><br><i>SCP-9115</i> was discovered by an off duty Foundation Agent driving through Germany on vacation after his car broke down. He accidentally drove through <i>SCP-9115</i> and continued driving until he reached the nearest town where he was promptly apprehended by Mobile Task Force Epsilon 12 (<i>"Used Car Salesmen"</i>) who were dispatched from Site-81 for containment of the anomaly. All persons who are subject to <i>SCP-9115</i>'s effects will try their best to stay in close proximity to it so that they can purchase cars from the salesmen at any cost, even if this requires them going into financial bankruptcy or selling away personal assets such as houses or family members . If a subject loses sight of <i>SCP-9115</i> for more than three minutes they will begin experiencing withdrawal symptoms which include nausea and hallucinations until <i>SCP-9115</i> is returned into view whereupon their symptoms dissipate immediately . Subjects will follow any command given by an instance of <i>SCP-9115</i> that would lead them towards purchasing a vehicle such as <i>"follow me back home"</i>. Once inside one of these vehicles subjects are unable to leave its presence unless brought outside range again . After approximately 24 hours subjects report feeling better inside a vehicle , although they do not appear more healthy physically but instead feel psychologically safe within its confines . This effect intensifies over time so that after several days most subjects refuse all food offered unless it has been inside one of these vehicles at least once before eating it , regardless if it has gone bad (see Addendum 9115 -1) . Eventually most cease physical activity completely and become catatonic except for involuntary movements related only actions needed for basic life functions such as breathing , digestion or excretion though this does not seem life threatening since physical health does not deteriorate further over time without human intervention . Subjects begin responding when spoken too but usually only say things like <i>"I love my new car"</i> before going back into catatonia while remaining still otherwise making little sense due changes in speech patterns similar those seen in patients suffering from Korsakoff syndrome (see Addendum 915 -2)<br><br><i>SCP-890</i> poses no direct threat but<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9115</i> was discovered on ██/██/████ when a MTF Epsilon 12 agent was monitoring local police calls for assistance using <i>SCP-</i>████. The call came from a nearby car dealership where half a dozen people had surrounded the entrance to the premises and would not let anyone inside . Police were called but all attempts to disperse the group failed and they were eventually forced to resort to force which resulted in █ deaths by gunshot wounds, several others being taken into custody by Foundation agents stationed at Site-81. All survivors interviewed gave similar accounts of how they had driven through an ancient looking gate before meeting the salesmen, who sold them cars at low prices despite their vehicles appearing heavily vandalized or having missing parts . All subjects also described feeling safe while within one of these vehicles since most seemed very distressed prior to entering them although none could explain why.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9115.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9115</i> appears to have similar effects on all items within its range that would normally decay if left exposed to natural elements for extended periods of time. For instance, a half eaten apple found next to one of the cars was still fresh and edible even though it had been there for several weeks prior their discovery by the Foundation. A test was conducted using a selection of food items that were put in front of <i>SCP-9115</i> but not inside any vehicles and monitored over time . All food tested showed signs of accelerated decay similar to those seen in subjects who experience prolonged exposure with <i>SCP-9115</i>'s effects and many became infested with insects or vermin within hours , though it is still possible for them to be consumed after being thoroughly cooked first as part of a meal .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9115.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9115</i>'s effects seem to be associated with the number of salesmen present within its range and so far no less than one has been detected . It is possible that there are more but they are simply not visible from the gate. Since <i>SCP-9115</i>'s original discovery it has always contained at least one such instance, although several were seen together on rare occasions. To date all instances have been male though it is possible that there exists female ones as well . When questioned about their origin and how they came to be in this state all salesmen replied with a similar story where they were once human but had died after being forced by some sort of celestial being(s) to sell vehicles for eternity as punishment for some crime committed against their deities, although none could recall what this was. As such many theories have been proposed regarding <i>SCP-9115</i>'s nature but none have been confirmed or denied due lack of evidence available (see Addendum 9115 -2)<br></div>
