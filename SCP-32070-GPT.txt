    <h3>Item #: SCP-32070 - "The Beanpaste Child"</h3>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-32070 refers to a neurodivergent child approximately 11 years old, named Alex. SCP-32070’s body superficially resembles that of an average human child, but upon closer examination, it has been discovered that its internal structures are entirely composed of a substance resembling anko, a sweet red bean paste commonly used in East Asian confectionery.</p>
<p>SCP-32070 requires no traditional sustenance, instead absorbing minimal nutrients from its surrounding environment through an unknown process. Despite the lack of typical human organs, SCP-32070 maintains functions such as movement and communication. Currently, SCP-32070 possesses average intelligence but exhibits significant creative abilities, particularly in art.</p>
<p>Any attempt to remove or sample SCP-32070's internal beanpaste results in immediate regeneration, and no lasting harm can be done to it, rendering SCP-32070 effectively immortal. SCP-32070 appears to view the world in unique ways and has expressed feelings of loneliness due to its anomalous nature.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-32070 is contained within a standard humanoid living quarters at Site-██. The room is furnished comfortably to accommodate its neurodivergent needs, with sensory-friendly lighting, noise cancellation features, and access to a variety of artistic mediums which SCP-32070 has shown a preference for.</p>
<p>While SCP-32070 does not require food or drink, a selection of traditional confections containing anko is provided daily, which seems to have a calming effect on it.</p>
<p>Personnel assigned to SCP-32070 must undergo sensitivity training to effectively communicate and engage with neurodivergent individuals. Any interaction with SCP-32070 requires approval from at least one Level 3 researcher specialized in psychology or pediatric care.</p>
<p>Physical examinations are to be conducted bi-weekly to monitor SCP-32070's anko composition and regeneration abilities. It is imperative that personnel avoid discussing its internal composition in its presence to prevent psychological distress.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>SCP-32070 was first encountered in a small town in Japan when reports of a 'candy child' surfaced, drawing Foundation attention. SCP-32070 was located at a local bakery where it was seemingly attempting to communicate with the owner by drawing pictures with its unique internal substance.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Initial Interview</h3>
<p>The initial interview with SCP-32070 revealed that it possesses a full awareness of its unusual condition but has no recollection of its origins. It has expressed a desire for social interaction and a degree of sadness stemming from its inability to integrate into society. Psychologists are working closely with SCP-32070 to improve its wellbeing.</p>
