<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9933</i> is a set of adverts on the SCP Wiki site</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9933</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9933</i> is to be monitored by Foundation webcrawlers for any new adverts. Any products or services that are advertised through <i>SCP-9933</i> are to be purchased and reviewed by Foundation personnel. If the product or service is deemed to have no anomalous properties then it may be used normally; if the product or service is deemed anomalous, then it will be contained in accordance with standard procedures for objects of its class.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9933</i> is a set of adverts on the SCP Wiki site. These adverts are typically placed in the top right corner of articles and pages, although they may appear elsewhere.<br><br><i>SCP-9933</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when a user views an advert for a product or service that they have expressed interest in, but not yet purchased. When this occurs, the user will be presented with an opportunity to purchase said product or service at a discounted price (in most cases 50% off). If the user purchases said product or service within 24 hours of viewing <i>SCP-9933</i>'s advert, then their account will be credited with an amount equal to 10% of their total spend on all products and services purchased from this point forward. This credit can only be used to purchase further products and services from vendors that advertise through <i>SCP-9933</i>. The exact amount refunded to accounts does not appear linked to any specific criteria; users who have spent considerable amounts on various products and services are just as likely to receive large credits as those who have spent very little.<br><br>The source code for <i>SCP-9933</i> has been examined but no anomalous code has been found; it is believed that this anomaly is generated by some form of AI rather than being manually inserted into each page where it appears by Foundation personnel or other parties unknown . Further information regarding this AI and its origin are currently pending investigation .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9933.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ??????? (a user who received a large credit from <i>SCP-9933</i>) </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on the 21/07/20██, after ██████'s account had been credited with the largest amount recorded so far. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, Mr. ???????, I'd like to ask you some questions about your account being credited by <i>SCP-9933</i>. ???????: Sure thing, doc! No problem at all! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation; firstly, can you tell me how much money was refunded to your account? ???????: Let's see… hmm… [Subject checks his bank statement on his phone.] Subject pauses for approximately 5 minutes while he reads through his statement and calculates the total amount refunded to him by <i>SCP-9933</i> since it appeared in his life . Subject then looks up from his phone and smiles at Dr.: That comes out to be $1,856 dollars and thirty seven cents! Pretty sweet deal if I do say so myself! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Following this interview it was discovered that accounts were being credited with different amounts of money depending on which products or services they had purchased through vendors who advertised through <i>SCP-9933</i>; accounts that had spent more money were more likely to receive larger credits than those who had spent less . Further investigation is ongoing into this phenomenon .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9933.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-96537, a 38 year old female of European descent. Prior history of multiple property crimes and petty theft.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was shown a product advert for an iPhone 6s Plus. Subject expressed interest in purchasing the phone at the time, but did not purchase it immediately after viewing <i>SCP-9933</i>'s advert. Subject was informed that she would receive a 10% credit if she purchased the phone within 24 hours of viewing <i>SCP-9933</i>'s advert, and then left to make her own decision regarding whether or not to do so. The subject was given no further information about this credit or its source .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 24 hours had passed, subject purchased an iPhone 6s Plus from ██████ Electronics for $999 USD using her own funds . Upon doing so, her account received a payment of $100 USD from an unknown source . This payment has been confirmed by Foundation webcrawlers as originating from the vendor that sold subject their product (see Addendum 9933.4). It is currently unclear how <i>SCP-9933</i> is able to identify vendors who have sold products to users who have viewed their adverts through <i>SCP-9933</i>; all attempts at tracking down these vendors have failed so far due to them being listed under aliases on official records and having no discernible online presence outside of advertisements through <i>SCP-9933</i> (see Addendum 9933.5).</div>
