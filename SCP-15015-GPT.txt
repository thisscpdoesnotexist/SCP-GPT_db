The Foundation was notified when <i>SCP-15015</i>'s presence caused the entire population of the town to become extremely happy and friendly. After containment, it was discovered that <i>SCP-15015</i>'s effect extends beyond humans; animals are also affected by his presence, causing them to be more social and less aggressive towards each other. Research into whether or not <i>SCP-15015</i> has any effect on plants is currently being conducted.<br><br><i>SCP-15015</i> claims that he can spread happiness to anyone through artificial light; however, this does not appear to be true as no one else has been affected by his presence besides those who were present during his discovery. However, due to the fact that he can make people extremely happy just by talking with them for short periods of time (see Interview Log 15015), it is theorized that if given enough time with someone else (especially if they are in a dark room), then he will be able to make them as happy as those who were present during his discovery; this would effectively give him an unlimited supply of D-Class personnel for testing purposes (see Addendum). Due to this possibility and due to the fact that he cannot be contained at Site 17 due its high amount of artificial lighting , <i>SCP-15015</i> will remain at Site 19 until further notice .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15015.1 : </h3>  Interview Log 15015<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15015</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. K█████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>After a few days of being at Site 19, <i>SCP-15015</i> requested to speak with someone due to the fact that he was lonely. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><i>SCP-15015</i> enters the room and sits down in front of Dr. K█████'s desk.<br><br><b>Dr. K█████: </b>Hello, please have a seat. I'm going to be interviewing you today for your containment procedures, is that alright? <i>SCP-15015</i> nods and smiles happily at Dr. K█████ .<br><br><b>Dr. K█████: </b>Okay then… let's get started then shall we? What is your name?<br><br><i>SCP-15015</i> looks up at the ceiling and thinks for a few seconds before answering .<br><br><b><i>SCP-15015</i>: </b>My name is ███ ███ , but everyone calls me <i>"Happiness"</i>. Dr. K█████ raises an eyebrow in confusion .<br><br><b>Dr.K████████: </b>Why do they call you <i>"Happiness"</i>? Does it have anything to do with why they were so happy when you were discovered? <i>SCP-15015</i> puts his hand on his chin while thinking before answering again .<br><br><b><i>SCP-15015</i>: </b>Well… I guess it does have something to do with my ability… but it's not really because of me; I just spread happiness around wherever I go… They're always happy when they see me because of this ability though; even if we don't talk long enough for my ability to take effect, they still become happier than usual just by seeing me smile at them or something like that… It's pretty cool if you ask me! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>That was very interesting! If what he said about spreading happiness through artificial light is true, then we should be able to use him as an unlimited supply of D Class personnel! -Dr .K████████<br><br><h3>Addendum 15015.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ███<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ███ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. K█████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to see if <i>SCP-15015</i>'s effect on people extends beyond artificial light. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr.K████████: </b>Hello, I'm here to interview you today about a friend of yours; he goes by the name <i>"Happiness"</i>.<br><br>███ ███: Oh yeah! Happiness is my best friend! He's so nice and sweet; he always makes me happy whenever we talk! We've known each other for almost our whole lives too! It's crazy how we met actually… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Well, that was very interesting… I guess his effect does extend beyond artificial light after all… -Dr .K████████<br><br><h3>Addendum 15015.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9632 and <i>SCP-15015</i> <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9632 is to enter <i>SCP-15015</i>'s containment cell with a flashlight. Once inside, she is to turn off the flashlight and wait for 10 minutes before turning it back on. <br><br><b>Results: </b>After turning off the flashlight, D-9632 sat down in front of <i>SCP-15015</i>. After 5 minutes, she began to feel extremely happy and friendly towards <i>SCP-15015</i>; however, this effect did not last long as it wore off after 10 minutes when the light was turned back on. <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>It appears that if there is enough artificial lighting present (especially if they are in a dark room), then he will be able to make them as happy as those who were present during his discovery; this would effectively give him an unlimited supply of D Class personnel for testing purposes . -Dr .K████████<br><br>Experiment #: 2<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>3D -2113 , 3D -2127 , and 3D -2134 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>All three subjects are ordered into a dark room where only one candle is lit . Once all three subjects are inside, they are told that they can sit wherever they want but must stay within five feet of each other at all times. <br><br><b>Results: </b>All three subjects sit next to each other near the candle; however , once darkness sets in after 5 minutes (due to no one being allowed in or out), all three begin moving around frantically looking for each other despite being told not too by Dr . K█████ . Two hours later when lights were turned back on, all three subjects were found huddled together crying due to fear from what happened while sitting alone in the dark room. <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b>It appears that if there is enough artificial lighting present (especially if they are in a dark room), then he will be able to make them as happy as those who were present during his discovery; this would effectively give him an unlimited supply of D Class personnel for testing purposes . -Dr .K████████<br><br>Note from Dr <br><br><b>K█████: </b>I think we're onto something here! We should continue experimenting with this!</div>
