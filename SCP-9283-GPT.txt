They are hunted by a lonely old man.</i> </h3> </center><br><h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9283</i><br><br><h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> ~~<i>SCP-9283</i>-1 is to be kept in a 10x10m room with a door and a window. The room shall display propaganda posters that depict <i>SCP-9283</i> as dangerous and the workers of ~~Site-██ are to regularly replace them.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> ~~<i>SCP-9283</i>-1 is an elderly male human, approximately 70 years old. He is of normal height and has a well toned musculature. His hair is completely white and he keeps it short, except the area around his face, where it grows to shoulder length. ~~<i>SCP-9283</i>-1 has a tan skin tone and wears thick glasses with black rims. He also wears black pants, a white shirt with red stripes on the sleeves and neck as well as dark green shoes that cover his ankles. Apart from being covered in scars from what appears to be past torture or surgery, <i>SCP-9283</i> does not display any abnormal features or traits .<br><br><i>SCP-9283</i> will occasionally leave its cell at night (at least once every two days) in order to hunt for the little blue specks referred to as SCP - 9 283 - 2 . It then captures them using its long tongue (which can apparently stretch up to 10 meters) before killing them by snapping their necks or stomping them under one of its feet until they are pulverized into paste , which is then consumed by SCP - 9 283 - 1 . While doing this however, if it senses that someone else is nearby , it will attempt to hide its face by pressing it up against the wall while eating so that no one can see what he looks like while doing so .<br><br>According to personnel who have seen him eat these creatures , they say that ~~SCP - 9 283 - 1 eats their bodies first before crunching on their heads until they turn into liquid inside his mouth which he then swallows down before continuing on with the rest of their body; however none have witnessed him actually swallowing any part of these creatures after biting off a piece from either end .<br> At some point between midnight and 6:00 AM daily ~~SCP – 9283 will return back into his cell after having finished consuming all of these creatures without anyone seeing him do this; even though surveillance footage clearly shows him leaving out through the gate at this time but not returning through said gate when he returns back into his cell later in the day without anyone seeing how exactly he does this due to there being no cameras outside said gate during this time period whatsoever either way ; even though there are always three guards stationed outside said gate at all times during non daylight hours regardless of whether it’s day or night 24/7 365 days out of every year since containment was established over 20 years ago due tot hat<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> ~~<i>SCP-9283</i> was found in an abandoned hospital located in the rural town of ████████, ██████ after reports of a “bigfoot” attacking locals had been brought to the attention of local law enforcement. He was initially tranquilized and taken into custody by two (2) police officers who were then mysteriously killed under mysterious circumstances when attempting to transport him back to the station for questioning. After this incident, further investigation revealed that these murders were not random and may possibly have been committed by ~~<i>SCP-9283</i> himself . The SCP Foundation was then alerted by local authorities to this occurrence and Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (“City Slickers”) was sent out in order arrest ~~<i>SCP-9283</i> while it slept within one of its huts during daytime; but upon approaching his hut they discovered he had somehow managed to slip out through a hole made underneath it while they were waiting outside for him all along without their knowledge.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9283.1 :</h3> Reported Sightings of <i>SCP-9283</i><br><br><br>Date: ██/██/████<br><br><br>Location: █████████ County, California.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9283.2 :</h3> Interview Log 9283-1<br><br><br>Interviewed: ~~<i>SCP-9283</i>.<br><br><br>Foreword: The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████ to determine the nature of ~~<i>SCP-9283</i>’s anomalous properties, along with why he is hunting the little blue specks (referred to as SCP - 9 283 - 2) in the first place and why they are so important to him . <Begin Log, 12/██/<br>1992 16:21> Dr.<br> ██████ : Hello SCP – 9 283 . We’d like you to answer some questions for us if that doesn’t bother you. SCP –<br> 9 283 : I don't mind answering your questions Doc. Dr .<br> ██████ : Alright then, what are these blue things that you keep eating?<br><br>(SCP - 9283 looks at him with a confused expression on his face.)<br><br>Dr .<br> ██████ : You know those blue creatures you keep eating every night? What do they taste like? (He puts one of his fingers into his mouth pretending to eat it.) Do they taste good or bad? (He then proceeds to make gagging noises while making a disgusted face). Does anyone else eat them as well besides yourself ? Or do you just keep them all for yourself ? Are there any other foods that you can eat besides those creatures ? Or just those things specifically only ? Why did it take so long before we noticed this</div>
