It is owned and operated by Bobby Bill Jr, who claims to have been running the ranch since he was 6 years old. The ranch consists of several acres of land, with various outbuildings and livestock pens.<br><br>The primary anomaly associated with <i>SCP-17051</i> is that all animals on the property are civets (Viverridae). All attempts at introducing other species onto the property have resulted in their sudden disappearance, usually within 24 hours. Any personnel attempting to enter the ranch without permission will be met with aggressive resistance from Bobby Bill Jr himself or his staff of armed guards.<br><br>Additionally, any person entering <i>SCP-17051</i>'s grounds has reported experiencing an intense feeling of dread and unease upon crossing its boundaries. This effect dissipates after leaving the area but can return if reentering it again soon afterwards.<br><br>It should be noted that despite its anomalous properties, <i>SCP-17051</i> does not appear to pose any immediate danger and no hostile intent has been detected from either Bobby Bill Jr or his staff towards Foundation personnel or civilians in general; however due to its Keter classification further research into this anomaly is required before a more accurate assessment can be made as to its true nature and potential threat level<br><br><h3>Addendum 17051.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, Foundation personnel were able to gain access to the ranch by posing as potential buyers.

This behavior was especially noticeable when discussing <i>SCP-17051</i>'s anomalous properties with outsiders.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17051.2 : </h3>Interview with  Bobby Bill Jr<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Bobby Bill Jr<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><h3>Addendum 17051.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/20██<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>Two (2) non-anomalous goats<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were introduced to <i>SCP-17051</i>'s grounds and monitored for 24 hours.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Both subjects disappeared within the first hour, leaving no trace behind.</div>
