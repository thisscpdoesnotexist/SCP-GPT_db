<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18183 is  The humanification of true justice.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18183<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Safe<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18183</i> is a phenomenon that causes any person or group of persons to become the embodiment of true justice. This includes but is not limited to:<br><br>• The ability to sense injustice and act upon it in an appropriate manner.<br>• A heightened sense of morality, ethics, and fairness.<br>• An increased level of understanding for both sides of a dispute or conflict. <br>• An innate knowledge and appreciation for the law, as well as its importance in society. <br>• A strong desire to seek out truth and bring about justice in all areas of life. <br><br>When <i>SCP-18183</i> is active, those affected by it will be driven by a strong urge to ensure that justice prevails at all times, regardless if they are personally involved or not; this can manifest itself via physical means such as intervening in disputes between others or providing legal advice when needed. In addition, those affected will also possess an enhanced capacity for empathy and compassion towards others who are suffering from injustice or unfairness; this can result in them advocating on behalf of those individuals without being asked to do so directly (e.g., speaking up against oppressive laws). <br><br> While <i>SCP-18183</i> does not appear to have any adverse effects on those under its influence - aside from potentially causing some discomfort due to their newfound awareness - prolonged exposure may lead individuals into becoming overly zealous defenders of justice which could lead them into taking extreme measures when dealing with situations where there appears no other option available (e.g., vigilantism).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18183</i> is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel, and any individuals affected by it are to be identified and contained as soon as possible. In addition, research into the effects of <i>SCP-18183</i> on those exposed is ongoing in order to better understand its capabilities and limitations.<br><br>Any attempts at using <i>SCP-18183</i> for personal gain or malicious intent are strictly prohibited; violators will be subject to disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18183.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of individuals in [REDACTED] were observed to have been affected by <i>SCP-18183</i>. After being identified and contained, the individuals were found to be members of a local gang who had previously been involved in numerous criminal activities such as extortion and drug trafficking. In addition, all members had also expressed an increased level of understanding for both sides of any dispute or conflict they encountered; this was further evidenced by their willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel during their containment.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18183.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18183</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████ <br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-18183</i> <br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt <br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-18183</i>. Can you tell me what your purpose is? <br><b><i>SCP-18183</i>:</b> My purpose is to bring about true justice in the world. To ensure that those who have been wronged are able to receive retribution and that those responsible for their suffering are held accountable for their actions. It is my goal to make sure that everyone has access to a fair and just system of laws and regulations, regardless of their social or economic status. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> How do you achieve this? <br><b><i>SCP-18183</i>:</b> By using my abilities to sense injustice and intervening in situations where it is present. I can also provide legal advice and assistance to those who need it, as well as advocating on their behalf when necessary. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you have any limits or restrictions? <br><b><i>SCP-18183</i>:</b> Yes, I am limited by the laws of the land in which I operate; while I may be able to sense injustice, if a law or regulation prohibits me from taking action then I am unable to do so. Additionally, while my goal is to bring about justice, I cannot force people into doing what is right; instead, I can only provide guidance and advice in the hopes that they will do the right thing. <br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><br><h3> Addendum 18183.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Experiment #1:</b> <br><b>Subjects:</b> D-4862, D-4863, and D-4864.<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subjects were exposed to <i>SCP-18183</i> for a period of two hours. During this time they were asked to observe and comment on various scenarios involving injustice or unfairness. <br><b>Results:</b> All three subjects displayed an increased awareness of the injustices present in each scenario, as well as a strong desire to bring about justice in any way possible (e.g., through legal means or physical intervention). Notably, when presented with scenarios that did not have an obvious solution, all three subjects proposed creative solutions that could be used to resolve the issue without resorting to violence or other extreme measures.</div>
