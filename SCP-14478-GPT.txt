A family living nearby reported hearing strange noises coming from the house, and when police investigated they found <i>SCP-14478</i> inside. The police were unable to open the door of the room where <i>SCP-14478</i> was located, so they called for backup. When more officers arrived, they were able to break down the door and enter the room where <i>SCP-14478</i> was located. They found that all of their equipment had been destroyed or damaged by some unknown force within a radius of 10 meters around <i>SCP-14478</i>'s containment locker. When they entered it, all of them became violently ill and experienced auditory hallucinations (see Addendum 14478.2). All personnel who entered this room are now considered lost causes and are not allowed near <i>SCP-14478</i> under any circumstances unless authorized by at least one Level 4 personnel with clearance to access this file or higher .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14478.2 : </h3>Interview with 【ACCESS GRANTED】<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Officer ██████, who was one of the officers that discovered <i>SCP-14478</i>. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Good afternoon Officer ██████, I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened when you found <i>SCP-14478</i>. Officer <br><br><b>██████: </b>Yes, of course doctor. What would you like to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>First off, can you tell me why your equipment stopped working when you got close to <i>SCP-14478</i>? Officer <br><br><b>██████: </b>Well… I'm not sure how to explain it doctor… it was almost as if some kind of force field or something had been activated around the room where we found that thing… but I don't think that's possible is it? <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>You're right, it isn't possible for a force field like that to be activated by itself without any power source nearby… but there is no way for us to know what caused this until we get more information from the other officers who were with you at the time and see if they experienced anything similar or not… so please continue with your story and tell me what happened after your equipment stopped working.. Officer <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Ok well then we basically just tried opening up the door but couldn't do anything since our equipment wasn't working so we called for backup and then waited outside until they arrived…. After about an hour or two more officers showed up and then they were able to break down the door using their batons and stuff so everyone went inside together….. And then all hell broke loose…. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview officer [REDACTED] was taken into custody due to his violent behavior towards personnel in Site-15's cafeteria . It should be noted that he did not show any signs of aggression during his interview with Foundation personnel .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14478.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-14478-1, a 34 year old Caucasian male. Subject has no history of mental illness.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-14478-1 was instructed to turn the dial on <i>SCP-14478</i> until it produced an effect, then describe what happened and how he felt. After that, he was to wait one hour and then repeat the procedure with another dial setting. The experiment was recorded using an audio recorder placed in front of <i>SCP-14478</i>'s containment locker. No other personnel were present in the room during this experiment except for Dr ████████, who monitored D-14478's vital signs using a medical device placed on his wrist. The experiment began at 11:30 AM on ██/██/19██ and lasted for two hours before being terminated by Dr ████████ after repeated requests from D-14478 to stop the test due to severe nausea caused by dial setting [REDACTED]. The following is a transcript of this experiment . Note that some sections have been deleted due to their graphic nature (see Addendum 14478.4). <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr <br><br><b>████████: </b>Please turn the dial until you find something interesting or unusual . D - 1447 8 - 1: Okay… [D - 1447 8 - 1 turns the dial clockwise.] (D - 1447 8 - 1 begins coughing.) Dr <br><br><b>████████: </b>Are you alright? You sound like you're choking . I'm going to call for backup! [Dr ████████ picks up his radio and calls for help.] (D - 1447 8 - 1 continues coughing.) Dr <br><br><b>████████: </b>What are you doing? Get away from that thing! It could be dangerous! [As soon as he says this, all equipment within 10 meters of <i>SCP-14478</i> is destroyed or damaged beyond repair.] (D – 1447 8 – 2 coughs again.) D – 14748 – 2: I don't feel so good… my head hurts… I can't see anything either… it's dark all around me… where am I? … Where did everyone go? … Why can't anyone hear me?! Help!! Someone please help me!! Help!!!!!!! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Experiment #2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Same as previous test <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as previous test <br><br><b>Results: </b>See Addendum 14477 Experiment #3 Subject — A male child between 5–10 years old Procedure — Child enters containment locker containing SCP—14878 Results — Child becomes violent when exposed to SCP—14878, causing severe damage before being sedated by security personnel</div>
