I am just here to ask a few questions about your abilities and how they work and all that jazz, ok? <br><br><b><i>SCP-11064</i>: </b>Sure! Go ahead! Ask away! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Ok then… So first off, how did you get these abilities exactly? Was it an accident or something else entirely different from that? <i>SCP-11064</i> looks at the floor for a second before looking back at the doctor with a smile on his face and says <i>"It's because of my wife Jada Pinkett Smith"</i>. Dr. ██████ laughs for a second before saying <i>"Ok… but seriously though how did you get these powers?"</i> <i>SCP-11064</i> looks at the floor again before answering <i>"Well… it all started when my wife Jada Pinkett Smith had been kidnapped by some people from another dimension who were trying to kill her"</i> he pauses for a moment while looking around him as if he is remembering something very important to him <i>"And so I went into their dimension with some friends of mine in order to save her"</i> he pauses again this time longer than before <i>"But we failed"</i>. He starts tearing up while talking about this incident, but quickly recovers himself by taking out his tissue box from his pocket and wiping away his tears with it <i>"After we failed in our attempt to save her life she told me that she loved me very much"</i> He takes another tissue out of his box while continuing talking about what happened next <i>"…and so I decided that I would do anything in order not to lose her forever"</i>. He finishes up by blowing his nose into one of the tissues he took out earlier on during the interview session . After finishing up blowing his nose into one of them he throws them both away into one of those trash cans found around every corner in any office building ever made since mankind has existed on earth . After throwing them away he continues talking saying <i>"…so after this happened I started training myself everyday until my body was ready enough so that I could use my abilities without having any side effects whatsoever."</i> After finishing up telling us about how exactly did he get these powers ,Dr Smith sits there quietly waiting for us (the foundation)to ask him more questions regarding this incident ,but we have no more questions regarding what has already been asked ,so instead we thank him for being cooperative during our interview session as well as giving us information regarding what had happened earlier today during Incident 110541 . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 11064.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>11064-1: </b>D-9341 was instructed to make a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith.
