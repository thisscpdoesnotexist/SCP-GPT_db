Any civilians who attempt to enter <i>SCP-15641</i> are to be given Class-A amnestics and released.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15641</i> is a large, dimly lit bunker. <i>SCP-15641</i> has 6 entrances and exits, but every exit leads back to the same entrance.<br><br><i>SCP-15641</i> was discovered when reports of a <i>"large, dimly lit bunker"</i> were reported in ██████, ████. Agents were sent to investigate after it was discovered that the location of <i>SCP-15641</i> matched the description given by witnesses. After entering <i>SCP-15641</i> and exploring it for several hours, agents found an exit which led them back to the entrance they had entered from previously. After confirming that this was indeed another entrance/exit of <i>SCP-15641</i> , agents left the area and closed off access to it until further notice could be given by higher authority on what should be done with <i>SCP-15641</i> .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15641.2 : </h3>Interview with ██████ ██████, a witness to <i>SCP-15641</i>.<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>██████ ██████ <br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ████ [BEGIN LOG] <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello Mr. ██████, I am Dr. ████ with the SCP Foundation and I would like to ask you some questions about your experience of <i>SCP-15641</i> . Could you please tell me what happened when you discovered it? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Yeah sure, so me and a few buddies were out on a camping trip in the woods when we decided to go explore this big tower we found there, which is where we found 15641 . We went in and explored around for a while before we got lost and ended up back at the entrance again after going through all 6 exits of it… or entrances I guess… <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Did anything else happen during your exploration? <br><br><b>Mr. ██████: </b>Well yeah one of my friends fell down this hole thing that was there but he just kept falling until he eventually landed on solid ground again so we didn't really think much of it other than <i>"wow that's deep"</i>. Then later on another friend fell down it too but he said something about being able to see his body from above him as he fell which was weird because none of us could see that happening at all… [END LOG] Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After further investigation into reports of people falling down holes inside <i>SCP-15641</i> , several bodies were recovered from underground caverns beneath the bunker itself with no signs of life or injury present upon them other than massive internal haemorrhaging caused by their fall through an unknown medium at high speeds (See Addendum 15641-1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15641.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15641-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-2878, male caucasian, age 32. Prior history of mental illness and addiction to heroin.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject instructed to enter <i>SCP-15641</i> and explore it for several hours before exiting via one of the entrances. After exiting the bunker, subject was given a Class-A amnestic and released.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject entered <i>SCP-15641</i> and explored it for several hours before exiting via an entrance which led him back to the entrance he had entered from previously. After being questioned about his experience in <i>SCP-15641</i> , subject stated that he had found no abnormalities or other abnormalities within <i>SCP-15641</i> . However, after being questioned further about his experience within <i>SCP-15641</i> , subject began experiencing severe paranoia and anxiety attacks until a Class A amnestic was administered to him . It is believed that this is due to exposure of some anomalous property contained within the bunker itself (See Experiment Log 15641 -2).<br><br>Experiment 15641 -2:</div>
