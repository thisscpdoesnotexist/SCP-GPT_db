If any abnormalities are detected, the area will be placed under lockdown until the situation can be resolved.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15390</i> is a herniated disc located in the lumbar region of ██████ ████, a 37 year old Caucasian male. <i>SCP-15390</i> was discovered after Mr. ████ visited his physician complaining of lower back pain and numbness in his left leg. MRI scans revealed the presence of <i>SCP-15390</i> and Mr. ████ was administered Class A amnestics and released from medical care with instructions to return for regular checkups until he no longer experiences any symptoms related to <i>SCP-15390</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-15390</i> is an extradimensional space that only manifests when Mr. ████ is experiencing physical discomfort or stress due to its presence in his body; this includes but is not limited to: physical trauma, muscle fatigue, sexual intercourse, bowel movements and menstruation. Once manifested, <i>SCP-15</i> 390 has been shown to be capable of transporting itself along with anyone within 5 meters into an alternate reality designated as Area 15 390 -1 . The exact nature of Area 15 390 -1 varies depending on what causes it to manifest; however it always seems to have a strong correlation between the cause for manifestation and what occurs once inside (See Addendum 1).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15390.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ████<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>Mr. ████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. █████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15390</i> manifested during a routine checkup and transported Mr. ████ to Area 15 390 -1 . Upon his return, he was administered Class A amnestics and interviewed to determine what had occurred while inside the anomaly. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Alright, could you tell me in your own words what happened? <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>Well… I was lying on the table when all of a sudden it felt like something had grabbed my leg and pulled me under the table where I couldn't see anything but white light; then everything went dark for a few seconds before I found myself on this beach with my wife and daughter swimming in the ocean… <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Did anything else happen while you were there? <br><br><b>Mr. ████: </b>Yeah, we were having such a good time that we decided to stay longer than we planned so we started walking back towards our hotel when all of a sudden this big wave came out of nowhere and knocked us down into the water; by that time it was too late to get back so I just started swimming as fast as I could until we got back safely… It's funny because it never even crossed my mind how dangerous it would be for them to swim in their condition but once they started crying from being cold or whatever, well let's just say that didn't last very long (laughs). Dr <br><br><b>.████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation, if you think of anything else please let us know immediately . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing the footage taken from Area 15 390 -1 , researchers have determined that <i>SCP-15390</i> manifests itself as an alternate reality where any cause for manifestation is made possible regardless of its nature or likelihood due to its extradimensional nature; however only one person can be transported at any given time which has led some members of MTF Beta-7 <i>"Maz Hatters"</i> assigned to monitor <i>SCP-15390</i> believe that there may be more than one instance of <i>SCP-15390</i> located within ████'s body although no further evidence has been found at this time .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15390.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>15390-1: </b>D-Class subject was instructed to engage in sexual intercourse with Mr. ████ while he was experiencing symptoms related to <i>SCP-15390</i>. Subject reported feeling a <i>"slight pressure"</i> before being transported into an alternate reality in which <i>SCP-15390</i> had manifested as a vagina located on the lower abdomen of Mr. ████. Subject reported that the area appeared to be made of flesh and muscle tissue, with several internal structures resembling reproductive organs; however, no reproductive organs were present at this time. After approximately 2 minutes of intercourse, subject reported feeling <i>"full"</i> and requested that they stop due to discomfort caused by the presence of <i>SCP-15390</i>'s reproductive organs inside them (See Experiment Log 15390 -2).<br><br>Experiment 15390 -2: D-Class subject was instructed to engage in sexual intercourse with Mr. ████ while he was experiencing symptoms related to <i>SCP-15</i> 390 . Upon entering Area 15 390 -1 , subject reported feeling a strong burning sensation followed by intense pain as several internal structures resembling male genitalia began emerging from within him; these structures were later identified as having been formed from portions of his intestines and bladder lining . After 10 minutes, these structures had completely emerged from his body and proceeded to penetrate Mr. ████'s skin where they remained attached for the duration of their stay within Area 15 390 -1 . At this point , all subjects present expressed feelings of extreme discomfort due to the presence o f foreign objects inside their bodies ; however, none expressed any desire or ability t o remove themselv es from Area 1 5 3 9 0 - 1 . A s a resul t , all subjects remained in Area 1 5 3 9 0 - 1 for th e duration o f th e experiment .<br><br></div>
