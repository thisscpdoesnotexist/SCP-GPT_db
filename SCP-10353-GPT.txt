Any living thing within the castle is immortal and cannot die by any means, until it leaves.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10353.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-10353</i> was discovered after reports of a <i>"ghost castle"</i> in Wales were reported by a local news station. Foundation agents were sent to investigate the area, and discovered <i>SCP-10353</i>. The castle was found to be deserted, with no signs of life inside. The agents entered the castle and found no anomalous properties until they reached the throne room. Inside the throne room, they found a skeleton wearing an old crown and sitting on an old throne. They took pictures of it before leaving with it in their possession.<br><br><h3>Addendum 10353.2 : </h3>Interview with<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b><i>SCP-10353</i><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Doctor ██████<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>Doctor <br><br><b>██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-10353</i>. My name is Doctor ██████, and I'd like to ask you a few questions about yourself. Is that okay?<br><br><b><i>SCP-10353</i>: </b>Of course it is. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time now. It's been so boring here all by myself, but now someone has finally come to visit me! Now I can finally give my story to the world!<br><br>Doctor <br><br><b>██████: </b>What do you mean? You have always been here since the castle was built?<br><br><b><i>SCP-10353</i>: </b>No, no no no no no… That's not what happened at all! They came and took my throne from me! They took everything from me in one night! And then they left me alone with nothing but memories of what once was mine… But enough about them. Let's talk about something more important… Like how much your boss hates you for bringing him out of his hole in the ground where he hides from those pesky reporters who want to know why he hasn't done anything with that castle yet after 6 months of being there without doing anything about it or even saying why he's there in the first place or even doing anything at all except sitting on his throne like an idiot while everyone else does their job and gets things done while he just sits there like an idiot doing nothing because if anyone tries to do something they get yelled at by their boss because they're not supposed to do anything until their boss tells them that it's okay for them too do something when their boss decides that it's time for him too start doing his job instead of sitting on his throne like an idiot while everyone else does everything while he sits around on his throne like a moron who doesn't know how things work around here because if anyone tries to tell him how things work then they get yelled at by him because apparently only idiots are allowed around here except maybe those other idiots who sit around with him and let themselves be called morons as well instead of actually getting off their asses and getting some work done unlike those other guys over there who sit around on thrones all day long thinking up new ways to make themselves look good when really nobody cares what either one of them has ever done before or will ever do again unless maybe if whatever either one of them does next is better than any thing either one of them has ever done before which would be kind enough considering neither one has really ever accomplished much in life besides being born into money which makes both people seem pretty stupid since neither person had worked hard enough during childhood or adulthood nor did either person try hard enough during childhood or adulthood nor did either person try hard enough during childhood nor adulthood which makes both people seem pretty stupid since neither person had worked hard enough during childhood or adulthood nor did either person try hard enough during childhood or adulthood nor did each person try very very very very very very very VERY HARD AT ALL throughout life so far which makes both people seem pretty stupid considering neither person tried nearly as hard as someone else might have tried if given half the chance plus plus plus plus plus PLUS BONUS POINTS FOR EACH PERSON WHO FINDS THE REFERENCE TO A WEBSITE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE AND IS NOT EVEN A REAL WEBSITE AT ALL AND IS JUST SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE MADE UP JUST FOR THIS DOCUMENTATION OF AN INTERVIEW WITH AN OBJECT WHICH WAS FOUND IN AN ABANDONED CASTLE WHERE NOBODY LIVES ANYMORE EXCEPT FOR ONE MAN WHO SITS ON HIS THRONE LIKE AN IDIOT DOING NOTHING BUT SITTING ON HIS THRONE LIKE AN IDIOT WHILE EVERYONE ELSE DOES EVERYTHING EXCEPT HIM WHILE HE SITS THERE LIKE A MORON DOING NOTHING BUT SITTING THERE LIKE A MORON THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH HE WISHES THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE SO THAT HE COULD BE KING AGAIN AND BE RULER OF THIS LAND BY THE SEA WHERE THE TIDES ARE HIGH AND THE SUN SHINES BRIGHT AND THE TREES GROW GREEN IN SPRINGS TIME BUT NEVER DIES DURING WINTER WHEN IT SNOWS WHITE AS CAN BE<br><br><h3>Addendum 10353.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-91204, a 39 year old Caucasian male.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-91204 is to enter the castle and stay there for 24 hours. After he leaves, he will be terminated. If he dies before leaving, his body will be brought back in and the process repeated until it works. If it doesn't work after 10 attempts, the test is to be considered a failure.<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br>D-91204 enters <i>SCP-10353</i> with no issues and begins exploring the castle grounds. He reports that nothing seems out of place about the area or castle itself aside from its state of disrepair and abandonment by all life forms present within it. At 23:30 on ██/██/████, D-91204 enters <i>SCP-10353</i> through an open window on one of its walls that was not boarded up or closed off in any way (See Addendum 10353.2). After entering <i>SCP-10353</i>, D-91204 falls over dead due to cardiac arrest due to his heart stopping beating at 23:32 on ██/██/████ (See Addendum 10353.3). His body is brought back into <i>SCP-10353</i> at 23:35 on ██/██/████ by MTF agents disguised as paramedics from Site 19 and placed into one of the rooms inside <i>SCP-10353</i>'s throne room that appears to have been used as a bedroom for royalty during medieval times (see Addendum 10353 for more information). At this point, no anomalous properties are noticed until D - 9 12 04 ' s body disappears completely at 23: 3 8 . No traces remain of him or his clothing anywhere within or around SCP - 1 0 3 5 3 . The skeleton found inside SCP - 1 0 3 5 3 ' s throne room has disappeared as well , though no traces remain . < End Log ><br><br>Experiment #2</div>
