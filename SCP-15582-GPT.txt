Testing of <i>SCP-15582</i> is not allowed at this time .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15582</i> is a black, one piece bathing suit. It has the appearance of a standard women's swimsuit, but the material is much more resistant to tearing and damage than normal swimwear. The suit also gives off an odor similar to that of rotting fish when worn by any human being.<br><br>When <i>SCP-15582</i> is worn by any female human being, they will get into a state of extreme relaxation and euphoria, even if they are not in water at the time. They will also become extremely attracted to males who are wearing <i>SCP-15582</i> as well as other females who are wearing it. This effect lasts for up to 2 hours after removal from <i>SCP-15582</i> and can be repeated multiple times per day with no long term side effects or addiction developing over time.<br><br><i>SCP-15582</i> was found in ████████ Beach Resort on ██/██/19██ when several people were hospitalized due to severe burns from hot water while using their hotel room showers . The Foundation was contacted after reports came in about what appeared to be <i>"an invisible fire"</i> burning through shower curtains and bathing suits alike . After investigation it was determined that there had been no malfunctioning equipment or other form of natural cause for this event . All victims were administered Class A amnestics before release back into society with cover stories about faulty wiring causing the incident and all witnesses were given Class C amnestics before being released back into society as well , claiming that they had been exposed to hallucinogenic gases during their stay at the resort . No further incidents have occurred since then except for one instance where an individual attempted suicide while wearing <i>SCP-15582</i> , but failed due to its durability . This individual received treatment for depression afterward instead with no long term effects occurring from this event either .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15582.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ████████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ████████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-15582</i> was recovered from the hotel room where it was found . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, Ms . ████████ .

Her vitals remain normal during this time until she begins screaming loudly while attempting to remove <i>SCP-15582</i> from herself. At this point her vitals begin spiking drastically along with several sudden bursts of steam coming from under the shower curtain before returning back to normal levels. Subject appears extremely distressed but no physical damage has occurred at this time besides minor burns on both arms due to hot water splashing onto them while wearing <i>SCP-15582</i> . Interviewed afterward, subject claims that she <i>"felt like [she] was being raped by a thousand men"</i> for approximately 10 minutes before managing to remove <i>SCP-15582</i> from herself and stop experiencing its effects at which point she felt extreme shame for what had just happened despite not having any memory of what had transpired during those 10 minutes .<br><br></div>
