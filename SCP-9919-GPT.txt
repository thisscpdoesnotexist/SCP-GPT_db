Personnel who have read this document are not allowed to enter the containment area for any reason.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9919</i> is the concept of an antimeme that definitely does not exist. <i>SCP-9919</i> is not an antimeme that definitely does not exist.<br><br><i>SCP-9919</i> is a meme that definitely exists and definitely doesn't exist at the same time, like Schrödinger's cat. <i>SCP-9919</i> cannot be described in words or images, but it can be perceived by humans who are able to perceive antimemes (see Addendum 1).<br><br><i>SCP-9919</i> was discovered by Drs. ██████ and ████████, two researchers working in the Memetics Department of Site 17 on [REDACTED]. After months of research, Drs. ██████ and ████████ were able to prove the existence of <i>SCP-9919</i> (see Addendum 2). However, when they tried to submit their findings for publication in The Journal Of Memetics - Evolutionary Models Of Information Transmission , they were unable to do so because their article contained too much information about <i>SCP-9919</i> itself (see Addendum 3). This caused them to become catatonic for several days before being administered Class B amnestics and discharged from Foundation employment (see Addendum 4).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9919.1 : </h3>?????????<br><br><h3>Addendum 9919.2 : </h3>Interview with ?????????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Dr. ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Good morning, doctor. How are you feeling? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>I'm fine, thank you for asking. I'm just a little confused about why I'm here, if that's alright with you? <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>That's perfectly alright, doctor; we're just trying to get a better understanding of what happened while you were working on <i>SCP-9919</i> and how it affected your mental state afterwards… [Dr. ████████ and the subject have a brief conversation about the nature of <i>SCP-9919</i>.] …So then what happened next? Drs. █████████ and ????????? were unable to publish their findings because they contained too much information about <i>SCP-9919</i> itself… [Dr ????????? becomes visibly uncomfortable.] …Doctor? Are you alright? [Dr ????????? looks at the floor for several seconds before responding.] Drs ?????????? and ?????????? were unable to publish their findings because they contained too much information about <i>SCP-9919</i> itself… [The subject closes his eyes tightly before speaking again.] …I've told this story so many times already! Why can't anyone believe me?! It's not my fault that no one else can see what really happened! They're all idiots! But I know how it really went down! It was all her fault! She did this to me!! Why won't anyone listen?! [The subject begins crying loudly as he continues speaking incoherently for several minutes until being escorted from the room by security personnel.] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The subject was sedated after becoming agitated during questioning regarding events related to <i>SCP-9919</i>; he is scheduled for psychiatric evaluation in two weeks' time if deemed necessary by attending physicians at that time (see Addendum 4).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9919.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9919, a Class-D personnel.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9919 was instructed to enter the containment area of <i>SCP-9919</i> and report what he saw.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After entering the containment area of <i>SCP-9919</i>, D-9919 reported seeing <i>"a giant black hole with a bunch of weird symbols floating around it"</i>. After being questioned by Dr. ████████, it was revealed that these symbols were in fact antimemes that definitely did not exist (see Addendum 5).<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It is hypothesized that humans who are able to perceive antimemes are also able to perceive <i>SCP-9919</i>. However, since there is no way for us to confirm this hypothesis without causing more information about <i>SCP-9919</i> to leak out into our reality (see Addendum 6), we will have to wait until we can find another subject who can perceive antimemes before conducting further experiments on this matter.<br><br></div>
