Subject complied with the instructions given to them. The computer was turned on, and <i>SCP-16844</i> infected it immediately. The subject was then told to leave the containment chamber. After leaving the room, subject began experiencing symptoms of a cold (sneezing, coughing). After 2 hours of monitoring, subject expired due to complications with their cold. It is believed that <i>SCP-16844</i> caused this death by infecting the subject's computer at home before they were brought in for testing and infecting them when they entered <i>SCP-16844</i>'s containment chamber . This test has been deemed inconclusive due to lack of evidence proving that <i>SCP-16844</i> killed D-16844 . Testing will continue as planned .<br><br>Experiment 16845/1:</div>
