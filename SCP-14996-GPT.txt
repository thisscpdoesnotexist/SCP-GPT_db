It has been contained at Site - ██ since its discovery on ██/██/████ . It is to be kept inside a 10 x 10 x 10 meter containment cell with no windows or other openings. The walls are to be made of reinforced concrete at least 2 meters thick, with steel reinforcement bars every 5 cm running parallel to each other for the entire length of the wall (in order to prevent it from breaking through). The door should have three <br><br><b>layers: </b>A layer of lead, then one made out of titanium, then another layer made out of steel reinforced concrete (in order for it not to break down). There should be no cameras inside its chamber; instead there must be two surveillance cameras outside its chamber (one facing towards it and one facing away from it) so that if anything happens within its chamber, personnel will know about it immediately. There must always be two guards stationed outside its chamber at all times; they are not allowed to leave their post until relieved by another guard unless absolutely necessary (such as an emergency evacuation). They must keep their weapons ready at all times; they may fire upon SCP - 1512 if attacked or if any personnel come under attack by SCP - 1512 . If they do fire upon SCP - 1512 , they are not allowed back into Site - ██ unless accompanied by armed guards who will shoot them if they try anything suspicious again while inside Site - ██ . They are also required to wear bulletproof vests while guarding outside SCP - 1512 's containment cell; this vest must have a tracking device attached so that when one guard dies or leaves his post for any reason, he can easily find his replacement without having contact with any other personnel. All nonessential personnel entering Site – 13's main site area must wear bulletproof vests as well as gas masks equipped with filters capable of filtering out [REDACTED] particles produced by [REDACTED] during activation phase 3 which lasts up until<br><br><h3>Addendum 14996.2 : </h3>Interview with ████ ███████, who discovered SCP - 14996<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>████ ███████ was the first person to discover SCP - 14996. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, Mr. ██████████ . I would like to ask you some questions about what happened in the Amazon rainforest on [REDACTED] . Please state your full name for the record and tell me how you first discovered SCP - 14996 . ████ <br><br><b>███████: </b>Alright… my name is [REDACTED] , but everyone calls me <i>"Bill"</i>. I'm a biologist by profession; I've been working in the Amazon rainforest for about 10 years now. One day, while studying some new species of plants that had just appeared there recently, I heard a strange noise coming from inside one of these plants' flowers; it sounded like something was struggling inside there and trying to get out! So I got curious and decided to take a closer look at it… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview was over, Dr. █████████ requested that all personnel who will be working with <i>SCP-14996</i> must have at least 3 years experience with plant life before they are allowed into Site-13's main site area or anywhere near <i>SCP-14996</i>'s containment cell (in order to prevent any further incidents).<br><br><h3>Addendum 14996.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 14996-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14996</i>. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>One D-class personnel is to enter SCP - 14996 's containment cell with a camera attached to his head, and one guard armed with a pistol is to be stationed outside of the chamber. <br><br><b>Results: </b>The D-class entered SCP - 1496 's containment cell without any problems; however, the guard had accidentally tripped on his way into position and dropped his pistol (which was equipped with a silencer). As he picked it up, he turned around and saw that the D-class was already dead (SCP - 1496 had broken through its containment cell wall). The guard fired two shots at SCP - 1496 , but both of them missed. He then ran back towards Site – 13's main site area as fast as possible while being chased by SCP - 1496 . After running for several minutes, he finally reached Site – 13's main site area where there were several armed guards waiting for him; they immediately opened fire upon him after seeing that he was being pursued by an enormous humanoid figure. After shooting him down, they discovered that it wasn't actually an enormous humanoid figure but just a normal human being wearing a large trench coat over their body (this is believed to have been used in order to trick the guards into thinking that it was actually an enormous humanoid figure). <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that if someone attempts to attack or harm SCP - 1512 , it will become hostile towards them instead of becoming hostile towards everyone else around them like most other SCPs do when they are attacked or harmed . This could possibly be due to its extreme intelligence level which allows it to think rationally about situations before acting upon them . This experiment also shows us how powerful and dangerous this entity can be if we allow our guards' weapons get taken away from them by enemy forces during an attack on Site – 13's main site area .<br><br></div>
