After this time has elapsed, all humans within earshot will fall asleep for approximately 2 hours and experience vivid dreams involving <i>SCP-15287</i>'s owner as a young child. These dreams are always pleasant in nature; subjects describe them as <i>"wonderful"</i> or <i>"magical"</i>. Subjects also report being able to hear <i>SCP-15287</i> playing during these dreams even if they are not within earshot of the object while awake.<br><br><i>SCP-15287</i> was discovered after reports of it were submitted to the Foundation front company ████████ Toy Company by multiple parents whose children had been experiencing recurring nightmares involving their past pet dogs dying after winding up <i>SCP-15287</i> while they were sleeping. The Foundation traced all affected families back to one common <br><br><b>source: </b>an antique store in ██████████, Wisconsin that had purchased several boxes of vintage toys from an estate sale in ████████, Wisconsin on 11/23/2016 . The store owner reported having no knowledge of any unusual items among the items he purchased at the estate sale, but agreed to cooperate with Foundation containment efforts once informed about <i>SCP-15307</i>'s properties.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15287.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ █████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>Interview conducted with the owner of <i>SCP-15287</i>, ███████ █████. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, Mr. █████. I'm here to ask you some questions about <i>SCP-15287</i>. <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Okay… I guess? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Thank you for your cooperation, sir; we know this is a difficult time for you and your family but we really need to know what happened with <i>SCP-15287</i> in order to properly contain it and make sure that no one else has their children's dreams affected by it again . [pause] <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Okay… well… uh… my wife and I bought the house from her parents when she got pregnant with our first child, so we didn't have any pets at the time since they had passed away before we moved in or anything like that so we were looking for something nice to put in the nursery so he'd have something familiar around him when he was born and my wife found this music box while she was out shopping one day at an antique store downtown, said it looked cute or whatever so I went ahead and bought it even though it was pretty expensive just because she wanted me too; never thought there'd be any problems with it until all of this happened… [Mr.]████████ pauses briefly before continuing his statement <br><br><b>[Mr.]████████: </b>…I mean yeah obviously there were other things wrong too but that's what started everything off wasn't it? The nightmares? And then everything else followed after that right? That's why everyone thinks its cursed now isn't it because of all those kids having those bad dreams about their pets dying after winding up that music box while they're asleep even though none of them ever did anything like that when they were awake or whatever but still how could anyone think a little kid would do something like wind up a music box over and over again while he's sleeping unless some kind of magic was involved right? So yeah maybe if my wife hadn't wanted me to buy her stupid toy none of this would've happened! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After being informed about <i>SCP-15287</i>'s anomalous properties, Mr D-8221 requested termination due to his inability <i>"to live knowing its out there somewhere"</i>.
