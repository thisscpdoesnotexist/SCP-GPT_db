In the event of <i>SCP-15354</i> changing into its true form, all personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and seal off the area using whatever means necessary until it returns back into its cake form.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15354</i> is a man that has been made out of cake. <i>SCP-15354</i> is approximately 1.8 meters tall, and weighs an estimated 400 kilograms.<br><br><i>SCP-15354</i> was first discovered in the kitchen of Site 18's cafeteria on ██/██/19██ by Dr. ██████ while he was eating lunch with his colleagues Drs. █████, ██████████ and Agent [REDACTED]. He immediately reported this to the rest of the staff who then proceeded to investigate further into <i>SCP-15354</i>'s origins and abilities.<br><br><i>SCP-15354</i> seems to have no physical manifestations when not being observed by anyone other than D class personnel; however, when it is being observed by someone other than D class personnel, it will start to move around freely in its containment cell (see Addendum 15354a). When not being observed by anyone other than D class personnel or any security cameras, <i>SCP-15354</i> will take on its true <br><br><b>form: </b>a large humanoid figure made out of cake which can only be seen through thermal imaging equipment (see Addendum 15354b). It has been shown that if any person makes physical contact with <i>SCP-15355</i> while it is in its true form, they will instantly die via unknown means (See Experiment Log 153545). If there are multiple people observing <i>SCP-15344</i> at once their bodies will start melting into their clothing as well as each other until they become one entity (See Experiment Log 153546). This entity has been dubbed <i>"Cake Man"</i> due to its resemblance to a man made completely out of cake; however this entity does not possess any anomalous properties besides those already exhibited by <i>SCP-15344</i> itself . Cake Man appears to have some sort of control over what happens within Site 18; for example during Incident 153547 Cake Man caused all doors except for one door leading outside Site 18 to lock themselves shut despite having no visible means or method behind doing so . In addition during Incident 153548 Cake Man caused all security guards within Site 18 apart from Agent [REDACTED] and Drs.[REDACTED] & [REDACTED]to become hostile towards everyone else within Site 18 despite having no visible means or method behind doing so either. It should be noted that these two incidents occurred simultaneously with each other yet neither incident had anything do do with each other nor did they have anything do do with the events occurring inside Experiment Lab 2 where both incidents took place at either time .
