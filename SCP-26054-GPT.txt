    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26054</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26054 appears to be a humanoid entity of a substantially large stature, specifically measuring at an impressive fifty feet tall. The entity displays an aesthetic and cultural affiliation consistent with the subculture known as "goth," characterized primarily by its distinctive dark clothing, makeup, and accessories. SCP-26054 is referred to colloquially among certain research staff as the "World's Biggest Goth Girlfriend."</p>
<p>The entity possesses traits that fit within the bounds of the gothic style, including but not limited to: jet-black hair that falls in waves to waist-level, pale skin, and an extensive wardrobe of size-appropriate gothic attire. It has also demonstrated a preference for music and art that align with the gothic genre.</p>
<p>Despite SCP-26054's size, the entity is generally non-hostile, exhibiting behaviors and emotional responses that suggest a sentient and sapient nature. The subject is capable of communication in fluent English, with a noted predilection for the poetic and melancholic diction characteristic of gothic literature. However, SCP-26054 has exhibited occasional bouts of existential angst and romantic yearning, which can result in unpredictable behavior and necessitate heightened containment measures.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-26054 is to be contained within a large, reinforced structure, akin to a hangar, with dimensions sufficient to accommodate its size and allow for limited movement. Due to its disposition and cultural inclinations, the interior is painted in dark, muted colors and furnished with oversized gothic-style furniture to maintain the entity's psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Acoustic insulation is mandatory to prevent vibrations from SCP-26054's movements and auditory preferences from affecting nearby structures or personnel. SCP-26054 has been granted permission to listen to music and engage in hobbies typical for gothic individuals, provided these activities do not compromise containment integrity. Interaction with SCP-26054 is to be conducted with utmost care, keeping in mind the entity's emotional sensitivities.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach, personnel are instructed to engage with SCP-26054 utilizing de-escalation tactics commonly employed in hostage negotiation scenarios, as it responds better to empathy and understanding than to show of force. Lethal force is strictly prohibited unless authorized by at least two level 4 personnel.</p>

<h3>Addendum 2: Addendum 2: Interview Log</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Haversham
<strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-26054</p>
<p>[The following is a transcript excerpt from an interview conducted to gain insight into SCP-26054's psyche.]</p>
<p>Dr. Haversham: "Can you tell me, how do you feel about being contained here?"</p>
<p>SCP-26054: "This existence, it is... confining. But it is not the walls that truly contain me; it is the vast, fathomless void within my soul. In this suspended state of ennui, I find both solace and imprisonment."</p>
<p>Dr. Haversham: "Do you have any desires or wishes?"</p>
<p>SCP-26054: "Ah, desires are but fleeting shadows in the dark recesses of the heart. I yearn for the gentle embrace of melancholy, the sweetly whispering winds of solitude."</p>
<p>[The remainder of the interview continues in a similar poetic vein, leaving researchers uncertain as to SCP-26054's true desires, which seem to be as elusive as the entity itself.]</p>
