    <h1>SCP-25722</h1>
<h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-25722</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Safe</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25722 is an ancient, leather-bound tome of unknown origin, consisting of approximately 300 parchment pages all written in an unrecognized language. Attempts to translate the content through conventional means or linguistic experts in dead languages have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The book emits a low-frequency hum detectable by human ears only when opened. Readers report a varying degree of uneasiness when in the vicinity of the opened book, with some experiencing mild nausea and headaches. Prolonged exposure has not been shown to have lasting effects.</p>
<p>The most anomalous feature of SCP-25722 is its capacity to become 'unspeakable' or undiscussable once the book is closed. Individuals who have viewed the content find themselves unable to articulate, document, or communicate any specific details of its contents — this effect persists in all known languages and through all forms of communication, including writing, speech, and sign language. The compulsion to avoid discussing the specifics of SCP-25722 seems to be unbreakable.</p>
<p>After extensive testing, it has been determined that while the anomaly prevents detailed discussion of the text, it does not extend to the description of the book itself, physical sensations experienced while reading, or the existence of the book.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-25722 is to be stored in a secured locker at Site-17 within the Literary Anomalies Wing. Access to SCP-25722 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above who have been granted permission by the current project head. Physical interaction with SCP-25722 is currently allowed only under supervised experimental conditions and is limited to no more than one hour to prevent undue duress from prolonged exposure to its effects.</p>
<p>Following each interaction, personnel must undergo a psychological evaluation before resuming normal duties to assess any effects generated by the tome’s anomalous properties.</p>
<p>In the event that pages of SCP-25722 are removed, intentionally or accidentally, the fragments must be collected and returned to the binding to prevent potential spreading of the unspeakable effect to the separated pages. The book is to remain closed outside of controlled testing to avoid unintentional exposure to its anomalous properties.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Experiment Log</h3>
<p>Several tests have been conducted to examine the properties of SCP-25722, particularly the nature of the unspeakable effect. In Test 25722-E-17, D-8432 was instructed to read a passage from SCP-25722 and then immediately describe the content. Upon closing the book, D-8432 appeared confused and unable to recall or articulate the passage read, stating only that "it's impossible to explain."</p>
<p>Further experiments have included attempts to document the contents of SCP-25722 using audio and video recording devices, which all resulted in static-filled or corrupted files that could not be deciphered upon playback.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Interview Log</h3>
<p>Interview Log 25722-IL-3</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ███████</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-4879, who had previously interacted with SCP-25722</p>
<p><strong><Begin Log></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Please describe the text you read in SCP-25722.</p>
<p><strong>D-4879:</strong> I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Are you saying that you don’t remember the text?</p>
<p><strong>D-4879:</strong> No, I remember reading it, but I can’t tell you what it was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Can you write it down?</p>
<p><strong>D-4879:</strong> [Subject attempts to write but after several minutes, he shows a blank piece of paper.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Why haven't you written anything?</p>
<p><strong>D-4879:</strong> It’s not that I don’t want to, doc. Every time I try, it’s like the words are there and then they’re just... gone. I can’t explain it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Can you describe how you feel right now?</p>
<p><strong>D-4879:</strong> It feels like my head is stuck in a vice every time I try to talk about what I read. Like I'm being squeezed to keep quiet. It's driving me nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Thank you, D-4879. That will be all for now.</p>
<p><strong><End Log></strong></p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Recovery Information</h3>
<p>SCP-25722 was recovered from an estate sale in █████████, England. The book was part of a collection belonging to a late professor of medieval literature who was reported to have become increasingly reclusive and obsessed with a particular volume in his collection prior to his demise.</p>
<p>Instances of the unspeakable nature of the text were first observed when the estate executors found they were unable to catalog the aforementioned volume. Foundation personnel embedded within local antique and rare book circles were alerted to this phenomenon and secured SCP-25722 for containment.</p>
<p>Addendum 3 concludes the current documentation on SCP-25722. Ongoing research is focused on deciphering the linguistic properties of the text while managing and understanding the psychological impact of its unspeakable effect.</p></div>
