How are you today?<br> Agent █████: I'm fine, thank you. Could we start now? I really don't like waiting around here and- (Agent stops and stares at his hands.) Dr.<br> Leckie: Is something wrong? Agent █████ looks up suddenly . He appears to be disturbed by something . He grabs his chair tightly, as if trying to hold on to reality . He mutters under his breath for several seconds before responding .<br> Agent █████ : What the fuck is this all about? You said that this was an interview! You can't just change what has happened! I'm not wasting any more time with your games!<br><br>Dr. Leckie sighs lightly before speaking again , appearing somewhat annoyed by the agents outburst .<br><br>Dr.<br> Leckie : Please calm down, sir. We simply need some questions answered- (The agent cuts her off )<br><br><br>Agent █████ : Fuck you! This isn't a game for me! Don't treat me like some kind of test subject or lab rat ! All these questions are bullshit anyway !( The agent stands up forcefully from his chair ) Are you people not content with ruining my life ? Huh?! Are there more experiments that have yet to be done?! More tests that need conducting?! Or is it just easier for everyone involved if I suffer in silence ?!! This isn't right ! It's not fair !!!( The agent begins pacing back and forth vigorously , staring at the floor as he speaks ) No one can ever know about what happened … If they did … They would put me away… Probably forever… But why? Why should anyone care!? It's no ones business but my own… And even then it doesn't matter because no one will ever understand…. Do they honestly think that anything can be gained from doing this kind of shit ?? Maybe if someone had told me everything beforehand than maybe I could've found a way out of all of it…. Maybe then things would've been different…..Maybe then none of this would've happened….. Or maybe i wouldn ' t have changed anything at all.....I don ' t know anymore... (The agent collapses into the wooden chair sobbing uncontrollably) Dr. Lecke sits silently watching him cry for several minutes before speaking again in an attempt to comfort him.. She reaches forward placing her hand on top of his trying to calm him down.(Dr. Lecke): Everything will be fine , son.. Your family still loves you very much- (Agent): My family.... My family.... How could they love someone like me...? What sorta monster could possibly come from good parents like them...? A monster who harms children… A monster who rapes young women….. A monster who murders innocent families…. Who destroys everything he touches…… Who allows people die<br><br><h3>Addendum 9019.2 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br><br>Interviewed: Agent █████<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr. Leckie <Begin Log> Dr.<br> Leckie: Good morning, Agent █████ .
