<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15304</i> is  the 1989 ABS-CBN dog VHS</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15304</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15304</i> is contained in a large enclosure at Site-19. The enclosure is to be kept clean and stocked with food, water, and toys. <i>SCP-15304</i> is not to be removed from the enclosure except for testing purposes.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15304</i> is a dog that was born in the Philippines in 1989. <i>SCP-15304</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it comes within 500 meters of any living human. When this occurs, <i>SCP-15304</i> will begin to emit a loud barking noise, and its eyes will begin to glow red.<br><br>After approximately 20 seconds of exposure, the subject will become an instance of <i>SCP-15304</i>-1. Instances of <i>SCP-15304</i>-1 are humanoid entities that have been transformed into dogs by <i>SCP-15304</i>'s effect. They are identical in appearance and capabilities to nonanomalous canines, but possess no sense of self beyond the need to follow their instincts (see below). Instances of <i>SCP-15304</i> do not appear to require sustenance or rest beyond what is required by nonanomalous canines; however, they do not appear able to survive outside their canine form for more than 24 hours without being exposed again by another instance of <i>SCP-15302</i> or 15303 (see below).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15304.1 : </h3>【LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED】<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-15304</i> was discovered in the home of a Filipino family. The family had reported their dog missing several days prior, and were unaware of its anomalous properties. Upon discovery by Foundation personnel, <i>SCP-15304</i> was taken into Foundation custody and given the designation <i>SCP-15304</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-15304</i>'s effect on humans was first discovered when Agent ██████ attempted to approach it for testing purposes. Agent ██████ immediately became an instance of <i>SCP-15304</i>-1 upon exposure to <i>SCP-15304</i>'s effect; however, she retained her human intelligence and memories after transformation (see Addendum 15304.2). Following this incident, all further testing of <i>SCP-15303</i> has been carried out by remote drone or robotic arm controlled from outside its enclosure.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15304.2 : </h3>Interview with 【LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED】<br><br>Following the discovery of <i>SCP-15304</i>, Agent ██████ was brought in for questioning. The following is an excerpt from the transcript of this interview.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15304.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15304-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Agent ██████, who had been exposed to <i>SCP-15304</i>'s effect previously.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was placed in the enclosure with <i>SCP-15304</i>, and instructed to approach it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon exposure, Agent ██████ immediately transformed into an instance of <i>SCP-15304</i>-1. Agent ██████ approached <i>SCP-15304</i> and began barking at it; however she did not appear to be attempting to attack or otherwise harm the object. Experiment <br><br><b>15304-2: </b><br><br><b>Subject: </b>Drones controlled by Foundation personnel from outside of the enclosure containing <i>SCP-15304</i>. <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Drones were instructed to approach and interact with <i>SCP-15304</i> as directed by personnel outside of containment area. <br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon exposure, drones immediately transformed into instances of <i>SCP-15303</i> and began barking at each other in a manner similar to that seen in Experiment 15303 - 1 through - 4 (see below). After approximately 30 seconds, all drones had been destroyed due to self inflicted damage caused by their barks; however no other anomalous properties were observed during this time period beyond those previously documented for instances of both SCPs 15303 and 15302 (see below). Addendum 153014.2 The following is a transcript from Experiment 153014 - 2 . Drone A: I don't understand what's going on here? Why are we barking? Drone B: I think we're supposed to bark! It feels good! Drone C: Barking is fun! Barking makes me feel good! Drone A: Yeah! Barking makes us feel good! It's so much fun!! Drone B: Yeah!! So much fun!!! We can bark forever!!! And we will!!! Forever!!!! Forever!!!!! FOREVER!!!!! All drones cease functioning after approximately 30 seconds due to self inflicted damage caused by their barks; however no other anomalous properties were observed during this time period beyond those previously documented for instances of both SCPs 1503 0and 15032 (see below). Addendum 1503 0 3 The following is a transcript from Experiment 15030 3 - 1 . Dog 1: I'm hungry… Dog 2: Me too… Dog 3: But there isn't any food here… Dog 4: What do you want? Food? Or something else? Dog 5 & 6 (simultaneously): Food!!!! Dogs 1 through 5 proceed towards where they believe food should be stored within the enclosure containing them; however upon arrival they find only toys instead of food or water supplies as expected . Dogs 6 through 10 begin digging at walls where they believe entrances leading outside should be located ; however upon finding only solid concrete walls , dogs 8 through 10 become agitated , resulting in physical altercations between them . Dogs 11 through 14 begin clawing at what appears likely an attempt at escape ; when escape fails , dogs 12 & 13 become agitated , resulting in physical altercations between them .<br><br></div>
