When <i>SCP--GPT</i>████ left, a student of the school, D-8944, who had fallen in love with <i>SCP-9018-GPT</i> approached it and began to speak with it. Moments later when D-8944 attempted to touch <i>SCP-9018-GPT</i>'s hand, its body began to glow brightly in all colors of the rainbow due to its anomaly.<br><br>Affected students were interviewed by Foundation agents and put under amnestics before being released back into their homes; however one student managed to escape before being caught by local law enforcement officers investigating the incident at [REDACTED] High School. The escaped student was later tracked down and her body was found mutilated along with her boyfriend's body which had been cut up into pieces (See Addendum 9018).<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9018.1 :</h3> Interview Log<br><br>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ████ and <i>SCP-9018-GPT</i> on 05/07/████:<br><br>Dr. ████: Hello, <i>SCP-9018-GPT</i>, and welcome to the Foundation. My name is Dr. ████ and I am going to be conducting an interview with you today so we can learn more about you and your anomaly. Can you please state your full name for the record? <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9018: Uh… I don't know what my full name is actually since I don't remember it… Dr. ████: Alright then, what is your first name? Would that help you remember more of yourself? <i>SCP--GPT</i><br>9018: Yeah probably, let's try first names first… My first name is (pause)… (<i>SCP-9018-GPT</i> begins to look around and hums as it tries to think of a proper first name). Fucking hell man! What the fuck happened to me?! Who even am I?! (<i>SCP-9018-GPT</i> appears distressed as it starts shouting out its questions). Dr. ████: Please refrain from using such language as we are recording this conversation; however feel free to ask any questions if they will help jog your memory about yourself or how this anomaly works but please keep them at a minimum as we do not want this conversation being left open for too long in case other anomalous objects hear us talking about them taking action against us or against you due to their jealousy towards you over their lack of being able to see rainbows whenever they want! Now onto my question again which was simply <i>"What is your first name?"</i> Do answer that one please! D-8944 gives no response for 7 seconds until she begins looking around nervously before looking back at her interviewer with fear in her eyes before speaking again in a less confident tone than before <i>"My….first..name..is…..(pauses) How do i fucking put into words how i feel right now? Its like someone got inside my head when i wasn't awake one day while staring at a painting on a wall i had never seen before…and stole all those memories from me."</i><br><br>Dr. ████ looks confused expression on his face after hearing what D-8944 said due ot its incoherent nature but decides not pursue any further questioning about it because he believes that she may have been hiding something else from him <i>"I believe our time here today has come to an end now Ms.-"</i> Before he could finish his sentence, both him and his assistant were found dead two days later by security personnel stationed outside of the containment cell housing 9018 after performing another checkup on its health status just after leaving without permission because they forgot that they still had work waiting for them back at their office building because they became distracted by something shiny instead of completing their assigned task given by one of Site 19's higher ups who previously ordered them not leave until further authorization comes forth which should be within 2 hours time assuming<br><br><h3><br>Addendum 9018.2 :</h3> The death of Site-19's Director of Personnel<br><br>On 05/11/████, the Site-<br>19 personnel director was found dead in his office after apparently jumping out of a window and committing suicide. He was found with a note left next to his corpse which read: <i>"It is too much for me to handle! The visions I see when looking at anything rainbow colored are so beautiful and disturbing at the same time! I am going to take my own life before that vision could consume my soul!"</i></div>
