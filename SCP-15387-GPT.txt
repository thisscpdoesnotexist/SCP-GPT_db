When this happens, the person viewing the image will hear a loud scream from behind them, then feel a sharp pain in their back. The person will turn around to see <i>SCP-15387</i> standing there with its pitchfork raised above its head before disappearing again. The victim of this attack will then begin to experience feelings of paranoia and fear for no apparent reason over time before dying from cardiac arrest . After death, subjects have reported seeing <i>SCP-15387</i> walking away from them after killing them . At times , subjects have reported hearing <i>SCP-15387</i>'s voice whispering <i>"Leave me alone"</i> repeatedly .<br><br><i>SCP-15387</i> was first discovered after reports of deaths caused by cardiac arrest were reported in ██████ , ██ , USA following sightings of <i>SCP-15387</i> appearing on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter . All victims had posted pictures or videos containing images of SCP- 15 387 shortly before they died . Class A amnesiacs were administered to witnesses who viewed images containing an image of 15 387 while Foundation agents investigated the area where these deaths occurred for more information about 15 387 's appearance and whereabouts . Agents found nothing out of ordinary at first but soon found that all victims had posted pictures containing images that could be traced back to one specific house nearby where they all lived within hours prior to their deaths . Agents entered the house where they found evidence relating to 15 387 including multiple cameras set up throughout the house facing every corner as well as several laptops set up showing live footage from each camera placed throughout the house along with several other computers linked together showing various files related to what appeared to be surveillance footage taken over weeks if not months (See Addendum 1). Agents also found [REDACTED] inside one room which contained traces of blood on [DATA EXPUNGED] along with hundreds if not thousands more items related to surveillance equipment scattered across multiple rooms within this residence (See Addendum 2). It was later revealed that these items belonged [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 15387.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted with the mother of one of the victims of <i>SCP-15387</i> after she viewed a video containing an image of <i>SCP-15387</i> shortly before her son's death . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello, Mrs. ███ . I am here to ask you some questions about your son's death. Mrs. ███: Yes, I know why you're here and I'm ready to talk about it if that is what it takes for this to be over with once and for all! Dr. ███: Alright then, let's begin shall we? What can you tell us about your son? Mrs. ███: Well he was a good boy really, he never got into any trouble or anything like that so I don't understand why this happened to him! He was always at home playing on his computer or watching TV when he wasn't at school or work! He never hurt anyone ever in his life! Dr. ███: Did your son have any friends? Mrs. <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Not really no…he didn't have many friends but the ones he did have were very close to him…I remember one time when they all went out together for his birthday but they came back early because they said something spooked them out while they were out…but my boy didn't say what happened so I don't know if it had anything to do with what happened later on… Dr . <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Do you remember their names? Mrs . [ REDACTED ]: No not really….they were just some kids from school….Dr .[REDACTED] ; Do you remember where your son worked at ? Mrs.[ <br><br><b>REDACTED]: </b>Yeah ,he worked as a cashier at the local supermarket near our house …why do want all these things ? Is there something wrong with my boy ? They told me that my boy died from cardiac arrest but how could this happen if he was healthy ! And how could someone die from cardiac arrest without even feeling any pain ! It doesn 't make sense ! Why would anyone want kill my baby?! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing the video containing images of 15 387 ,it has been determined that 15 387 appeared in several frames within three seconds which means that 15 387 must have been moving very quickly in order for its image not be noticed by witnesses who filmed themselves taking pictures and videos while visiting this location (See Addendum 3).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15387.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 15387-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-96631 (Male, 23 years old)<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to view a picture containing an image of <i>SCP-15387</i> on a laptop. After subject viewed the photo, he turned around and saw <i>SCP-15387</i> standing there with its pitchfork raised above its head before disappearing again . Subject then turned back around and continued to watch the laptop screen. Once subject finished watching the video, he was instructed to turn around once more. No instance of <i>SCP-15387</i> was found in the room . Testing concluded .<br><br><b>Results: </b>Subject reported feeling paranoid after viewing images containing an image of 15 387 for several days before dying from cardiac arrest one week later. Autopsy revealed that subject died from cardiac arrest caused by severe stress as well as multiple cuts across his back which were determined to have been caused by <i>SCP-15387</i>'s pitchfork during Experiment 15387 - 1 . It appeared that after Experiment 15387 - 1 , <i>SCP-15387</i> had learned how to appear behind subjects without having been seen beforehand , since it did not appear in front of D - 96631 until after it had already killed him .<br><br>Experiment 15387 - 2:</div>
