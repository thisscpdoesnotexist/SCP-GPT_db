SCP-9009's wheels are fixed in place, and it cannot be opened. All attempts to open SCP-9009 have failed, as any attempt to do so results in the object moving away at a speed of 10km/hr from its holder.<br><br>SCP 9009 will drive itself towards its destination when powered on. It does not require fuel or driver input besides an initial input to start driving; however, the "driver" must be present for SCP 9009 to move at all. The destination that SCP 9009 drives toward is predetermined by O5 command ahead of time; if no destination is set for it beforehand, then it will simply drive around Sector G . No matter where or how fast O5 Command sets the destination for SCP 9009 to travel towards , upon reaching its stated location SCP 909 will reorient itself and begin driving towards another location . This process repeats indefinitely until either an order for its current traveling direction is issued or until power is cut off from the object (which causes it to return back towards Sector G).<br><br><br>If any living being enters inside of SCP 909 while in motion, they will experience no ill effects aside from mild dizziness after exiting (however this dizziness can be negated by entering inside again after exiting). If the driver dies during use of this vehicle then control will transfer over to another individual that can enter into the vehicle within 5 minutes and remain there without leaving it again (even if they fall asleep) until someone else enters inside after them . If nobody else enters within 5 minutes then control transfers back over into whoever entered last previously before expiring . However if multiple people are in there then whoever comes first has priority over who controls this entity . When somebody comes into contact with this entity while moving they also become designated as "drivers" ; however cars left unattended should always have one person enter inside before shutting off as doing otherwise may result in accidents due to mass effect fields created by these vehicles which cause objects nearby them (including other cars) such as trees or poles on roads get pushed out of their way when traveling at high speeds resulting with them impacting directly onto car windows causing deaths instantly due impact force alone being enough force able pierce through car steel frames easily<br><br><br>As long as somebody remains inside each time without leaving , than he/she may choose which direction he/she wants [it]to go instead regardless what orders are given beforehand since these entities seem follow basic common sense even though do not operate under normal physics;however [it] seems only capable going forward without backwards movement capabilities since unable turn around completely reverse directions unless new driver chooses different route opposite ways like normal human drivers would normally do instead<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-9009 was first discovered on ██/██/20██, when a group of high school students were caught driving SCP-9009 through the streets of [REDACTED], New York. When questioned, they claimed to have "found it in a garage with a bunch of other weird shit." They were administered class A amnesics and released.<br><br><br><h5>Addendum 9009.1:</h5> Testing Log<br><br><h5>Test Date:</h5> ██/██/20██<br><br><h5>Subject(s):</h5> <i>SCP-9009-GPT</i> with driver Dr. ██████ and passenger Agent ████████. The destination was set to be [REDACTED] , a remote island near the coast of New York, USA. All previous attempts to travel outside Sector G were denied by O5 Command. Other personnel present during testing include 2 armed guards.<br><br><br><h5>Result:</h5> Upon entering, SCP-9009 quickly accelerated towards its destination at speeds greater than 300km/hr . At one point, it skirted a semi truck at approximately 80 meters away from it . Shortly after passing the semi truck, several police cars began pursuing the object . As per safety precautions, the object was ordered to turn back towards sector G before being destroyed if found out of bounds by any law enforcement officials that engage in pursuit (however due to mass effect fields created by these entities all nearby objects except for other cars get pushed out of their way instead resulting them ramming directly onto car windshields causing deaths instantly due impact force alone being enough force able pierce through car steel frames easily since not designed for normal human or animal flesh ). Upon reaching Sector G , SCP-9009 pulled into a parking space and shut off automatically; both personnel exited without incident .<br><br><br><h5>Analysis:</h5> If not turned around precisely in time (in this particular case, before reaching its destination), SCP-9009 will continue driving until it enters into an unclaimed area or until another order is issued against its current traveling direction. It is also worth noting that if no one else enters inside within 5 minutes after the driver dies then control transfers back over into whoever entered last previously before expiring as mentioned earlier in this report as well although when more people are inside than originally intended changing drivers can cause confusion about who controls whom when multiple people are inside unless clear instructions given beforehand about what actions each individual would take under certain circumstances such as who drives where for what duration etcetera etcetera<br><br><h5>Addendum9009.2:</h5> Incident Report<br><br><h5>Test Date:</h5> ██/██/20██<br><br><h5>Subject(s):</h5> <i>SCP-9009-GPT</i> with driver Dr. ██████ and passenger Agent ████████.
