Infection manifests as the inability for affected subjects to distinguish between real and fictional experiences. This can be observed through an inability for subjects to differentiate reality from fiction in any media, including literature and film. The effect also extends to all social interactions within affected subjects' lives; all friends and family appear no different than imaginary characters created by the mind of the subject.<br><br>The largest recorded outbreak of <i>SCP-9432</i> occurred on ██/██/██ at █████ Elementary School in ██████,<br> Texas as a result of contamination through a school field trip: Subjects were exposed after encountering live specimens during their visit; although no one was physically harmed by exposure at this time, students began reporting symptoms consistent with <i>SCP-9432</i> infection shortly after their return home.<br> Affected parents then unknowingly spread <i>SCP-9432</i> throughout the local community by interacting with other parents while still under its effects: It was not until several weeks had passed that researchers were alerted to an unusual number of reported <i>"sightings"</i> around town while investigating reports that local children were missing school due to illness borne out of boredom - it remains unclear how many students remain infected at this time due to lack of class attendance records for those afflicted over recent months . The incident was successfully contained when MTF Delta 3 <i>"Marshals"</i> infiltrated █████ Elementary School during closing hours under cover story involving scheduled maintenance work; they determined remaining infection rates among staff members before returning control back into Foundation hands . A full list can be found here .<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9432</i> came to the Foundation's attention through media reports of parents who claimed their children were disappearing after playing with imaginary friends. Although this was initially written off as mass hysteria, it was eventually determined that the disappearances were an anomalous event caused by <i>SCP-9432</i> .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9432.1 :</h3> Interview log<br><br>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ██████, for the purposes of understanding <i>SCP-9432</i>'s effects on the human mind.<br><br><br>Interviewed: D-5423, a 34 year old Caucasian male,<br> who will be referred to as subject hereafter Interviewer: Dr.<br> ██████ Foreword: Subject is one of the few victims of <i>SCP-9432</i> who has shown some signs of recovery through extended isolation and therapy. <Begin Log> Dr.<br> ██████: Hello, I would like to ask you some questions about your family and how they were affected by exposure to <i>SCP-9432</i> .<br> Subject: Yeah, sure; that's fine with me man - just give me a second to get my head straight again first… (Subject pauses for several seconds) Okay then… where should we start? Dr.<br> ██████: Let us begin with your family - what was it like before you contracted <i>SCP-9432</i> ?<br> Subject: Well shit man; I don't really remember that far back - but from what I can tell it was pretty good times all around really… Me and my dad worked together at the local auto shop in town for years until he got sick with cancer last year - he passed away a few months after that… Dr. ██████ nods quietly (Subject pauses for several seconds) That's when everything started going downhill though… My mom stopped going out much once she lost her job as a hairdresser when her boss retired last year; she didn't have anyone else around anymore so I tried taking care of her instead while still trying to keep up with work myself...but then one day she just fucking disappeared! She didn't leave any note or anything so naturally I thought she had gone off somewhere without telling me - but then I went looking through our photo albums later on and realized something wasn't right here when there weren't any pictures of her in them anymore; it wasn't long before everything turned into this fucked up mess anyway so who gives a shit now anyway? What do you mean? How did things turn into <i>"this fucked up mess"</i>? Subject stares vacantly at his hands briefly before answering (Subject pauses for several seconds) Oh yeah! Sorry about that doc; uh well uh let me see if I can remember all this stuff properly now that its been awhile since those days … Uh well it started off pretty simple at first actually - after only about two weeks without sleep or food , my brain just kinda shut off completely and everything felt like an outtake from some weird drama film or something … But after another week or two went past without anything better happening than waking up every morning feeling more miserable than the day before , things really began getting messed up in my head … It didn’t take long before all these strange characters started popping outta nowhere everywhere around me wherever they could find space too …I never knew where they came from originally but they seemed convinced enough that they were real people themselves<br><br><h3>Addendum 9432.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9432</i><br><br>+ <i>SCP-9432</i> - <i>SCP-9432</i> <h3><br>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9432</i> <h3><br>Object Class:</h3> Keter <h3><br>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> ~~~ All attempts to contain <i>SCP-9432</i> have been met with failure.

Addendum 9432.2a : Discovery Through Foundation agents embedded within several state and federal departments in Texas , it was determined that █████ Elementary School had become increasingly unruly over recent months - teachers were reporting extreme difficulty maintaining order among students while facing increasing incidences of truancy among students and their parents alike . Though police records indicated no change in local crime rates during this time period , they noted a significant increase in "suspicious</div>
