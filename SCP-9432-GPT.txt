It is to be kept in a glass case within Site-19. Due to its anomalous properties, it must not be exposed to any light other than that of the light bulb above its glass case at any time and no personnel are allowed to enter or exit Site-19 unless wearing an opaque mask and minimum security gear (see Document 9432/A for details). Any personnel affected by <i>SCP-9432</i> must be taken into custody immediately and given Class A amnestics after questioning and returned to their site of origin if possible.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9432</i> is an orange and white tabby cat with a black nose and ears. It weighs 2 kg and stands at 31 cm. The anomalous properties of <i>SCP-9432</i> become apparent when it is exposed to any light other than that of the light bulb above its glass case at Site-19, which it seems to be completely unharmed by. It will then begin to grow, reaching a maximum size after 5 minutes. The time taken for <i>SCP-9432</i> to reach its maximum size increases if it is exposed to brighter light sources, reaching a maximum growth time of 30 days if exposed directly to sunlight.<br><br>Upon reaching its maximum size (at which point there are reported abnormalities in the space surrounding <i>SCP-9432</i>), it will release a large amount of gas from various orifices in its body for approximately 1 hour before returning back down in size until returning back into containment . This process has been shown not to harm either personnel or equipment during this time period as long as they remain within Site 19; however all personnel that were outside of Site 19 during this period were found dead due to unknown causes shortly afterwards . Additionally, no traces of said gas have been found after the duration expires, nor can the source be located outside the boundaries of site 19 despite numerous tests being conducted on various objects containing samples throughout [REDACTED]. Should <i>SCP-9432</i> escape containment , these effects would spread outwards from Site 19 at an exponential rate with an estimated range up to █ kilometers after 24 hours (see Document 9432/A). More research into these effects must continue before we can know more about them .<br><br><i>SCP-9432</i> was discovered within [REDACTED] by Researcher ██████ who had previously owned <i>SCP-</i>[DATA EXPUNGED] prior his employment here at Foundation facilities. He claims that upon noticing that he could feel something inside his head while holding <i>SCP-</i>[DATA EXPUNGED], he decided that testing should be conducted on both subjects using standard testing procedures for Class D Personnel prior placing said subjects under observation via security camera footage before entering Site -19 wearing Level B Hazmat suits and placing them in separate rooms while wearing opaque masks over their faces and changing gloves between test runs without fail each time so as not expose themselves any more than necessary without knowledge or approval from higher ups (see documentation 9432/A) . Following exposure by Researcher ██████ , both instances dematerialized along with all other objects within 3 meter radius around each subject including<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9432</i> was discovered during a recovery conducted by Foundation Personnel within [DATA EXPUNGED] on █/██/19██, after an anonymous tip was sent to the Department of Investigation. The recovery team quickly discovered <i>SCP-9432</i> inside the residence of one [REDACTED]. A search revealed no other anomalies or information regarding origin of <i>SCP-9432</i> nor its current state prior to discovery due to the lack of surviving residents nearby.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9432.1 :</h3> As per request of Dr. ██████, the following is an interview log of <i>SCP-9432</i><br><br><h3>Addendum 9432.2 :</h3> Following Incident 9432-23, the following interview has been approved by Dr. ██████ for use with <i>SCP-9432</i></div>
