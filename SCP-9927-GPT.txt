It will then proceed to jump up and down on their shoulders until they collapse under the weight of <i>SCP-9927</i>, at which point it will claim victory over said individual. The victim's perception of time during this process seems to slow down significantly, causing them to believe that the event lasts for upwards of ten minutes despite only lasting for approximately three seconds in reality.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9927.2 : </h3>Interview with ???????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-9927</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-9927</i>'s acquisition by the Foundation. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-9927</i>, my name is Doctor [REDACTED]. I would like to ask you a few questions if that's alright with you? <br><br><b><i>SCP-9927</i>: </b>Sure thing, doc! What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>How did this happen? Did someone do this to you? <i>SCP-9927</i> laughs for approximately 15 seconds before responding. <br><br><b><i>SCP-9927</i>: </b>Nah man, it just happened one day when I was walking home from work and some kids were making fun of me because of how short I am so I started yelling at them and then I jumped up on their shoulders and they couldn't even feel my weight so they fell over! It was pretty funny actually! They were all screaming about how heavy I felt but it just wasn't true at all! They didn't even try to get me off their shoulders! So then after that day everyone started acting like me and jumping on people's shoulders until they collapsed under the weight of whoever was standing on them but no one could feel our weights anymore so we kept doing it until we realized that nothing had changed about us except our perception of ourselves. Then we decided to start calling ourselves <i>"SCP"</i>s because we're not sure what else to call ourselves since no one can see us or feels us when we stand on them unless they collapse under our weight which makes sense since the only reason why anyone would be able to see or feel us in the first place is if they collapse under our weight while standing on someone else's shoulder right? So yeah, that's how it happened…I guess…Dr.? Are you still there? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Yes yes, thank you for your time ??????? . You are free to go back into your cell now; Agent [REDACTED] will escort you there now if he hasn't already done so by the time this transcript has been approved for release by O5 Command . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It is believed that ??????? has been returned safely back into its containment cell as requested by Dr. ██████ .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9927.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-9927-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9927, a Caucasian male who measures in at 2.13m.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to approach <i>SCP-9927</i> and allow it to stand on his shoulders. Subject was then instructed to walk around the testing chamber while <i>SCP-9927</i> was still standing on his shoulders. After approximately three minutes, subject collapsed under the weight of <i>SCP-9927</i>, at which point he was removed from the testing chamber and allowed to rest for five minutes before being questioned about his experience with <i>SCP-9927</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>When questioned about his experience, subject claimed that he had been carrying <i>SCP-9927</i> for upwards of ten minutes despite only having carried it for three seconds in reality. Subject also claimed that he could feel its feet digging into his back during this time period, despite not actually touching him at any point during the experiment .<br><br>Experiment 9926 -2:</div>
