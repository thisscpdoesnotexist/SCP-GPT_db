The Foundation was alerted to its presence by the Police Department of ███████, who initially suspected it of being an active meth lab. A raid by police officers and agents from Site-17 revealed that <i>SCP-9164</i> had been placed there approximately 2 months prior. <i>SCP-9164</i> is composed primarily of a variety custom components purchased online. Several parts are identifiable as originating from other anomalous items discovered previously, including <i>SCP-1842</i> and <i>SCP-871</i> (both destroyed).<br><br>Testing has shown that any person within viewing or touching distance of <i>SCP-9164</i> will be unable to move, with their body apparently frozen in place despite lack of physical damage or restraint. This effect extends outside of the visible space occupied by the subject's body; subjects have been observed to be able to open doors and walk through hallways without moving their bodies; this effect does not appear to extend beyond visual range. Subjects are capable of vocalizing normally despite this inability and can perform actions such as writing on paper if given sufficient motivation; this appears only possible if they do so without looking at what they are doing . In addition, all forms of electronic communication devices appear disabled when used near <i>SCP-9164</i> - any messages sent while within range become undeliverable after several seconds and fail to arrive at all upon leaving the area affected by it.<br><br>Attempts have been made at using GPS trackers on test subjects affected by 9164 but these invariably cease functioning shortly after entering its proximity due to interference with transmission signals between them. Attempts at placing tracking devices onto 9164 itself have also failed due to apparent teleportation and impenetrability (see addendum). All attempts thus far have resulted in failure . To date no means has been found for removing those under 9164's effects from viewing distance , nor for delivering food/water/supplies or performing medical procedures while they remain so incapacitated . It is currently believed that should a person remain under its effects indefinitely , he/she would eventually die due to biological processes requiring movement extensive enough for them not occurring over time (combination research into methods for reversing this effect is ongoing).<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9164</i> was recovered from the basement of a house in ███████, MI, along with a number of components used in its construction. The owner of the property (name currently classified) has been located and interviewed by Foundation personnel. They claimed to have been influenced by <i>SCP-9164</i> to build it and blamed it for their domestic difficulties over the preceding several months - they described finding themselves unable to perform basic tasks such as washing dishes or taking out the trash without assistance, stating that <i>"the machine was always watching"</i> and that this was why they were unable to move. This person subsequently committed suicide shortly after being removed from 9164's vicinity .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9164.1 :</h3><br> Evidence of possible anomalous activity around <i>SCP-9164</i> prior to containment includes:<br><br>The death of ██████████████, a friend of the property owner and a neighbor, who had been walking past the property when <i>SCP-9164</i> was being constructed. He had reportedly grown increasingly irritable and depressed in behavior since this time. An investigation into the cause of his death revealed that it was due to self-inflicted gunshot wounds, not previously recorded by police. A note found at his apartment read <i>"The machine is watching."</i> Police officers were unable to confirm whether or not 9164 had ever been present at its location prior to recovery . (investigation ongoing)<br><br>Signs reading <i>"THE MACHINE IS WATCHING"</i> found on nearby buildings in the weeks before discovery by foundation personnel<br><br><h3>Addendum 9164.2 :</h3> Item recovered during initial recovery at the same time as <i>SCP-9164</i>.<br><br>Found in the same room as <i>SCP-9164</i>, this object was initially believed to be a nonfunctional prop of some kind. However, it has been discovered that it is in fact possessed of similar power to that of <i>SCP-9164</i> and can extend its effects over a much wider area than 9164 itself. It is unknown whether this item was created by the property owner or if it had existed previously; due to its deleterious effects on research personnel involved with 9164, testing has been suspended for time being .</div>
