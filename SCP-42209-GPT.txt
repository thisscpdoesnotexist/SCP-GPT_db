<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-42209 is an ornate, early 20th-century staircase located within a former noble estate, now designated as Site-██. The staircase itself is composed of oak wood with a faded red carpet runner along its center. It comprises twenty-four steps leading to a stone landing, above which is a closed wooden door. The door is non-functional and seemingly for aesthetic purposes, as no structures are present beyond it.</p>
<p>SCP-42209's anomalous properties manifest when an individual steps onto the first stair without carrying a source of light, such as a flashlight or candle. Upon doing so, the staircase appears to descend or ascend indefinitely, depending on the direction the individual believes they are going. This illusory extension can last for hours or even days, with subjects reporting no signs of an endpoint.</p>
<p>The illusion is immediately broken if any light source is introduced, which reveals SCP-42209 to be unchanged in its original construction. No long-term physical effects have been observed in subjects after experiencing SCP-42209's properties. However, psychological evaluations indicate increased levels of stress and mild cases of existential dread in some individuals after prolonged exposure. </p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-42209 is to be secured within Site-██, with access restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. The premises are to be monitored by video surveillance at all times to ensure no unauthorized access occurs.</p>
<p>A perimeter has been established two meters from SCP-42209's base to prevent accidental activation of its anomalous properties. Warning signs have been posted to advise of the potential psychological impact on those affected by SCP-42209.</p>
<p>In the case of testing, subjects must be under constant supervision, and a light source should be immediately available to terminate the effect of the anomaly abruptly. All testing must be approved by at least one Level 3 researcher and adhere to the documented procedures to minimize potential psychological harm.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>SCP-42209 was discovered following reports of a "haunted staircase" in the local town of ████████. Foundation agents investigated these claims and discovered the property had been abandoned for several decades. Agents █████ and ████ were the first to encounter SCP-42209's anomalous properties during an initial reconnaissance mission. Upon their return, the Foundation secured the estate and classified it as Site-██.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Experiment Log</h3>
<h4>Experiment 42209-E1:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-56103</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to climb SCP-42209 without a light source.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Subject ascended SCP-42209 for approximately two hours before requesting termination of the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject reported a sense of endless progression but no alterations in perceptions aside from the lengthening staircase.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 42209-E2:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-56103 (repeat testing)</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject instructed to descend SCP-42209 without a light source, one day after E1.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The subject descended for three hours before a flashlight was introduced, revealing the subject's actual position at the sixth step from the base.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Despite the anomaly's predictability, subjects often experience a strong disillusionment when the illusion is broken.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experiment 42209-E3:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> D-56002</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject carried a concealed light source and was instructed to ascend SCP-42209, activating the light source at will.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> Upon encountering the illusion of an infinite staircase, the subject activated the light after 45 minutes, negating the anomaly.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject's cooperation was noted, and psychological resilience against the anomaly's effects seemed particularly strong.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addendum 3: Incident 42209-I1</h3>
<p>On ██-██-20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██, leading to a temporary power outage. SCP-42209 was inadvertently activated by a security officer attempting to navigate the site during the blackout. The illusory effect persisted for approximately four hours as the officer believed he was descending to an underground level for evacuation purposes.</p>
<p>The incident emphasized the importance of emergency lighting systems in areas containing SCP-42209 and prompted a scedule for power system checks and redundancies at Site-██. The officer was later treated for acute anxiety but was otherwise unharmed.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Researcher Notes</h3>
<p>While SCP-42209 is considered 'Safe,' continued observation and research are essential. The psychological impacts, although generally mild, pose interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between human perception and anomalous items. SCP-42209 may prove beneficial in developing treatments or training to combat memetic and perception-based anomalies.</p>
<p>Ongoing analysis is directed toward understanding the mechanism that permits SCP-42209 to influence the mind's interpretation of space and time. Additionally, cross-testing with subjects exhibiting innate resistance to memetic and cognitohazard effects is planned, with the goal of identifying potential overlaps in anomalous psychological defenses.</p>
