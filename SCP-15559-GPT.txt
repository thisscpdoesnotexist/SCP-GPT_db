<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15559</i> is  Doug Walker, the Nostalgia Critic</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15559</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15559</i> is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. <i>SCP-15559</i> is to be provided with a laptop computer and an internet connection as well as any other amenities it requests. As of the time of writing, no requests have been made by <i>SCP-15559</i>; however, it has expressed interest in receiving various books and movies from the Foundation's library which are currently being reviewed for potential inclusion into its containment chamber.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15559</i> is Doug Walker, the Nostalgia Critic. <i>SCP-15559</i> exhibits no anomalous properties when not being observed.<br><br><i>SCP-15559</i> will only become active when a human subject (henceforth referred to as the <i>"observer"</i>) views it directly and then ceases observation of it. Upon becoming active, <i>SCP-15559</i> will begin to move towards the observer at a rate of 1m/s until it comes within 2m of them. At this point, <i>SCP-15559</i> will begin to speak in a voice similar in tone and inflection to that used by Doug Walker in his review series <i>"Nostalgia Critic"</i>. The exact words spoken by <i>SCP-15559</i> vary between instances but are always consistent with how they were spoken by Doug Walker during said review series; however, they can be paraphrased as follows:<br><br><i>"Hello there! I'm here from [REDACTED] Productions! We're looking for some fresh new talent and we think you'd be perfect for our next big project!"</i><br><br>Upon being questioned about their identity or purpose, instances of <i>SCP-15559</i> have shown themselves capable of producing false identification cards which display the name <i>"Doug Walker"</i> alongside an image matching that used on actual driver's licenses issued in the state where the instance was encountered; however, none have been found to contain any information relating to an actual person named Doug Walker who matches their appearance or description. All attempts at tracking down these persons have failed so far due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. In addition, all attempts at determining whether or not these persons actually exist outside of their appearances during encounters with instances of <i>SCP-15459</i> have resulted in inconclusive results due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Attempts are currently underway in order determine if any individuals named <i>"Doug Walker"</i> actually exist anywhere outside Foundation containment facilities where they are being held pending further investigation into whether or not they are linked with any anomalous activity occurring within these facilities; however no such link has yet been found. It is also worth noting that all attempts by Foundation personnel assigned under Level 2 clearance or higher who view an instance of <i>SCP-15499</i> while attempting this research have resulted either directly or indirectly (as a result from actions taken against them) causing them harm ranging from mild injuries including but not limited too cuts and bruises inflicted upon them via blunt force trauma caused by various blunt objects including but not limited too baseball bats and crowbars up through death via gunshot wounds inflicted<br><br><h3>Addendum 15559.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, the original observer of <i>SCP-15559</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted on 01/██/20██ after an instance of <i>SCP-15559</i> attempted to recruit Mr. █████ for its <i>"next big project"</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello Mr. █████, I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened earlier today. <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Sure thing doc! What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Well first off, I'd like to know how long you've been working here at Site-19? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>About 2 years now! I transferred over from Site-17 when they were closing it down; it's a lot better here than there is if you know what I mean! Dr.: Yes, that's very true… Now then, could you tell me what happened earlier today when one of our security personnel approached your desk and asked if he could borrow your stapler for a moment? (At this point in the interview, Mr.) [REDACTED] begins displaying signs of distress such as sweating and shaking his head rapidly back and forth; however he does not respond verbally for several seconds before responding with the following statement) <br><br><b>[REDACTED]: </b>Oh God no… please tell me that wasn't real… Please tell me that was all just some bad dream or something! It can't be real right?! It just can't be!! (Mr.) [REDACTED] begins crying hysterically at this point while rocking back and forth in his seat while repeating <i>"It can't be real"</i> over and over again until eventually succumbing to his injuries sustained during an attempt by another researcher assigned under Level 2 clearance or higher who viewed an instance of <i>SCP-15459</i> while attempting research into whether or not any persons named Doug Walker exist outside Foundation containment facilities where they are being held pending further investigation into whether or not they are linked with any anomalous activity occurring within these facilities; however no such link has yet been found (see Addendum 15559.2). <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Due to the sensitive nature of this information as well as its potential impact on future containment procedures involving instances of <i>SCP-15459</i> , access will only be granted in cases where Level 4 clearance is confirmed beforehand .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15559.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-82321, a male caucasian of average build and height. Subject has been trained in the use of firearms and has been given a 9mm pistol loaded with non-anomalous bullets. Subject is also aware that <i>SCP-15559</i> is capable of speech but has not been informed as to what it may say or do.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-82321 will be instructed to enter <i>SCP-15559</i>'s containment chamber alone and then observe it for 2 minutes before ceasing observation of it.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon ceasing observation, D-82321 reported seeing an individual matching the description given by instances of <i>SCP-15559</i> standing approximately 2m away from him; however, no such entity was visible to researchers viewing via security camera footage or any other means available at this time. After remaining still for approximately 30 seconds without speaking, the entity began moving towards D-82321 at a rate of 1m/s until coming within 2m distance; upon reaching this point, the entity stopped moving completely and spoke in a voice similar in tone and inflection to that used by Doug Walker during his review series <i>"Nostalgia Critic"</i>. The exact words spoken by this instance were consistent with those used previously by Doug Walker during said review series; however they can be paraphrased as follows:<br><br><i>"Hello there!
