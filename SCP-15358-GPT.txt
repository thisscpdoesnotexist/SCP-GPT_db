<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-15358</i> is  none of ya business</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-15358</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Keter<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-15358</i> is to be contained in a 10x10x10 meter cell with the walls lined with rubber padding. <i>SCP-15358</i> is to be fed one (1) live pig every two (2) days. <i>SCP-15458</i> is not allowed to leave its containment cell under any circumstances.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15358</i> is a large, green, and very angry blob. It is capable of changing its shape at will. <i>SCP-15358</i> has been known to growl and move around in a very hostile manner. <i>SCP-15358</i> was first discovered in the home of Mr ████████ after he had recently purchased it from ████████'s Pets & Aquariums, as seen here:<br><br><i>SCP-15358</i> was contained with the use of Class D personnel posing as employees at ████████'s Pets & Aquariums. The containment procedures are currently under review due to the fact that Class D personnel were not able to contain <i>SCP-15358</i> for longer than 30 minutes before being terminated by it.<br><br><i>SCP-15458</i> is also known for its ability to change color depending on what mood it is in, which makes containment somewhat more difficult as you can't tell if it's going to attack or not just by looking at it. It has been noted that when presented with a toy ball (which we have designated SCP-XXXX2), SCP-XXXX will become docile and playful until said ball comes into contact with any other object or person besides itself (see addendum 15458/a). When this occurs, SCP-XXXX will immediately become hostile towards the offending party(ies) and attempt to kill them using whatever means necessary (see addendum 15458/b). If no persons are present during this time period then no anomalous behavior has been recorded outside of normal animal behaviors such as eating, sleeping etc… However once any person enters within 10 meters of subject they immediately become hostile towards them regardless if they are holding an instance of XXXX2 or not (See Addendum 15458/c). During testing XXXX showed hostility toward all members involved but seemed especially interested in Dr [REDACTED]. As such Dr [REDACTED] was removed from testing indefinitely until further notice from O5 council . -Dr [REDACTED] <br><br><b>Note: </b>I don't give a shit what O5 council says I'm going back down there! -Dr [REDACTED]<br><br><h3>Addendum 15358.1 : </h3>????<br><br><h3>Addendum 15358.2 : </h3>Interview with ????<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> SCP-XXXX </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after an incident in which a Class D personnel attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-15358</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning XXXX, how are you today? <i>SCP-15458</i> (SCP-XXXX): I'm fine, why do you ask? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well we were just wondering if there was anything that you wanted or needed? You've been here for a while now and we'd like to help make your stay more comfortable if possible. <i>SCP-15458</i> (SCP-XXXX): Comfortable huh? Well I guess it would be nice to have some company every once in a while but I don't think that's going to happen any time soon… [At this point SCP 15458 began to change color from green to blue] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>What do you mean by that XXXX, what's wrong with me coming down here and talking with you? [At this point the subject changed color again from blue back into its original green state] <i>SCP-15458</i> (SCP-XXXX): Nothing is wrong with it but they won't let me out of my cell so unless they change their mind then I don't see much use in talking at all… [At this point subject changed color from green into a light red] <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Why would they keep you locked up like this XXXX, surely there is something we can do about it! Subject changes color again from red back into green before responding <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After the interview had ended the cell door opened and two armed guards entered the room and escorted Dr .██ out of containment area before terminating him on site due to his <i>"incompetence"</i>.
