The door to the containment room is to be guarded by two security personnel at all times. No electronics are allowed inside the containment chamber, including cell phones and radios. Any personnel who come into contact with <i>SCP-10202</i> must immediately report for psychological evaluation.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-10202</i> is an entity that will kidnap people and trap them in the comments section of YouTube videos. <i>SCP-10202</i> can only be seen by the victim, but others can see the comments left by <i>SCP-10202</i>. <i>SCP-10202</i> has been known to use a variety of methods to lure victims into its trap, including using enticing titles, tags and descriptions as well as offering rewards such as <i>"free money"</i> or <i>"free gift cards"</i>.<br><br><i>SCP-10202</i>'s victims are unable to leave their current comment section until they have finished typing their comment. If they try to leave before finishing their comment, then <i>SCP-10202</i> will block them from leaving with a message saying <i>"You haven't finished your comment yet."</i><br><br><i>SCP-10202</i> will also make it impossible for victims to close or refresh their browser window while trapped in its comments section. It does this by making all links on the page redirect back to itself and removing any buttons that would allow for closing/refreshing of the page (such as Xs at the top right corner). Victims are able to navigate away from its comments by using other means such as bookmarks or history but when they return they find themselves still trapped in its comments section. This effect seems limited only to web browsers and not other applications (such as social media apps) which allows some victims escape through these means but when returning they find themselves still trapped within SCP 1020's control. The only way for a victim's family members or friends outside of 1020's control is if someone else opens up another tab on another browser so that person can view what is happening within 1020’s control without being affected themselves; however this method does not work if both parties are viewing through mobile devices due to restrictions placed on mobile browsers preventing multiple tabs from being opened at once . If there isn’t anyone else around who can help free you from 1020’s control then you may have no choice but wait until it decides you have typed long enough so it releases you back into your own internet browsing experience; however this could take hours depending on how long your original post was supposed be . Once released back into your own internet browsing experience you should immediately log out of all social media accounts used while stuck in 1020’s control so that it cannot track where exactly you go next .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10202.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ██████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ ██████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted after <i>SCP-10202</i> kidnapped the victim and released them back into their own browsing experience. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: How are you feeling? <i>SCP-10202</i> is not known to cause any physical harm to its victims, so it is safe for the victim to answer questions about their experience. <i>SCP-10202</i>'s victims do not appear to be aware that they have been kidnapped by an anomalous entity, instead believing that they have simply been trapped in a long comment section of a YouTube video and they are unable to leave until they finish typing their comment. <br><br><b>Victim: </b>I'm fine…just really annoyed at this YouTube video I was watching earlier…I had just started typing my comment when suddenly the screen went blank and when it came back up there were all these new comments on the page but none of them were mine! It took forever for me to scroll down far enough so I could see what my original comment said because there were so many other comments in between mine! And then when I finally got there I found out that my original comment wasn't even posted anymore! Dr. ███: Did you notice anything strange about those comments? Victim; No…why do you ask? Dr. ███; Nothing important, please continue with your story if you don't mind . Victim; Well anyways, once I finally did get back into my browser window everything looked normal again except for one thing….my history was completely wiped clean! All of my bookmarks had disappeared too, which meant that if wanted to go anywhere else on the internet from where ever this video took place then it would take me hours trying figure out how exactly did get there originally since all of those sites weren't saved on any of my bookmarks or history anymore . That's why it took me so long trying figure out how exactly did get here originally since all of those sites weren't saved on any of my bookmarks or history anymore .

Dr. ██████ was chosen as the test subject due to his previous experience with <i>SCP-10202</i> and his familiarity with computers and the internet.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Dr. ██████ is locked in a room with a laptop containing internet access and instructed to browse the internet for 30 minutes without interacting with any other people or electronics outside of the room he is in during this time period, then report back on what happened while he was browsing (if anything). After 30 minutes had passed, Dr. ██████ reported that he had not seen any unusual activity while browsing online but did report feeling <i>"weird"</i> after logging out of all social media accounts used during his session . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that <i>SCP-10202</i> has some form of control over electronic devices used by its victims even when they are not connected to the internet or other electronics outside of 1020's control .

D-91262 was chosen as test subject due to his criminal history involving violence against women and because it would be hard for him to escape from confinement if things got out of hand during testing . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-91262 was given access to a laptop containing internet access within containment chamber #██ within Site 19's high security wing without any other electronics present inside containment chamber #██ except for one security camera observing him from behind one way glass observation window located across from where D-91262 is seated at computer terminal within containment chamber #██; however there are no microphones attached to this camera so audio cannot be recorded from it . After being left alone inside chamber #██ for 15 minutes without incident, surveillance team monitoring through security cameras observe that D-91262 has logged into an account on YouTube using credentials provided by Foundation personnel before entering containment chamber #39; however there are no comments made by anyone else on this account besides D 9 12 62 who begins typing up comment under video titled <i>"10 Reasons Why You Should Never Get A Cat"</i> which video has been viewed over 4 million times since uploaded onto YouTube two years ago; comment written by 9 12 62 takes up entire comment section underneath video but does not seem out of place compared to normal comments left underneath videos uploaded onto YouTube; all links leading away from main page lead back towards main page instead (however these links do work properly when clicked) ; after typing up comment under video , surveillance team observing through security cameras observe that 9 12 62 begins clicking refresh button located next right side corner underneath main page but every time he clicks refresh button , entire website refreshes itself instead just like how links leading away from main page lead back towards main page instead (however these links do work properly when clicked) ; once refreshed , entire website refreshes itself again just like how every time he clicks refresh button , entire website refreshes itself again ; once refreshed , entire website refreshes itself again just like how every time he clicks refresh button , entire website refreshes itself again ; once refreshed , whole screen goes black except for words typed into comment section beneath <i>"10 Reasons Why You Should Never Get A Cat"</i> video which words read as <br><br><b>follows: </b>“You haven't finished your comment yet” <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that SCP 1020 2 can manipulate both electronic devices connected directly into electricity source such as laptops as well devices connected indirectly such as smartphones via cellular network connection in order prevent victims trapped inside its control from escaping its influence unless someone else opens up another tab on another browser so they can view what is happening within 1020’s control without being affected themselves .
