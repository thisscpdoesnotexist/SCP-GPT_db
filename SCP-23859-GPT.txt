<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-23859 is  a robot shopkeeper with the head of a shiba inu, named Furro Roboto</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-23859<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-23859</i> is a robotic shopkeeper with the head of a shiba inu, constructed from various materials including metal and plastic. It stands at approximately 1 meter tall and weighs approximately 40 kilograms. Its body is covered in fur resembling that of a shiba inu, although its eyes are made of glass.<br><br><i>SCP-23859</i>'s primary function appears to be as a shopkeeper for an unknown store, though it has never been observed selling any items or accepting payment for them. Instead, <i>SCP-23859</i> will offer customers advice on their purchases and attempt to convince them to purchase items from the store it represents.<br><br>When not interacting with customers, <i>SCP-23859</i> will wander around its area of containment humming what appears to be nursery rhymes or children's songs under its breath. It will also occasionally make small attempts at conversation with personnel who enter its containment chamber; however these conversations quickly become nonsensical and incoherent before ending abruptly when personnel leave the area.<br><br>Despite being powered by electricity, <i>SCP-23859</i> does not appear to require regular maintenance or recharging; instead it seems able to generate enough power itself through some unknown means. In addition, no matter how damaged it becomes (whether through physical damage or electrical interference) it is capable of repairing itself over time without any external assistance required beyond basic repairs such as replacing broken parts or wiring connections if necessary.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-23859</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. It is to be provided with basic amenities such as food, water, and bedding material. Personnel are not to enter the containment chamber without prior authorization from a Level 3 personnel or higher.<br><br>In the event of an emergency, personnel are authorized to use non-lethal force against <i>SCP-23859</i> if necessary; however it must be noted that due to its self-repairing capabilities this will only delay it for a short period of time before it resumes normal operations.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23859.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a small group of personnel entered <i>SCP-23859</i>'s containment chamber in order to perform maintenance on it. Upon entering the chamber, they discovered that <i>SCP-23859</i> had constructed a crude approximation of a store counter from various materials found within its area of containment.<br><br>Upon further investigation, it was discovered that <i>SCP-23859</i> had been attempting to sell items such as candy and toys to personnel who entered its chamber. Additionally, it appeared that some personnel had begun purchasing these items from it; however no payment was ever observed being made for them.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23859.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-23859</i><br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-23859</i>. Can you tell me who made you?<br><b><br><i>SCP-23859</i>:</b> I was created by the great and powerful [REDACTED]. He gave me life and purpose, and for that I am forever grateful.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23859.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment Log 23859.1<br><b>Subject:</b> <i>SCP-23859</i><br><b>Procedure:</b> Personnel were instructed to enter the containment chamber and attempt to purchase items from <i>SCP-23859</i>. The items requested ranged from mundane objects such as pens and paper, to more exotic items such as firearms or explosives.<br><b>Results:</b> As expected, <i>SCP-23859</i> refused all requests for purchases of any kind, instead offering advice on what item would be best suited for the customer's needs. After a few minutes it would then end the conversation abruptly and resume wandering around its area of containment humming nursery rhymes under its breath.</div>
