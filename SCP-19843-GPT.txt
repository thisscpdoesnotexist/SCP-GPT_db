<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-19843 is  the Taco Hole…</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-19843<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-19843</i> is a phenomenon that occurs in the form of an extradimensional space, referred to as the Taco Hole. The Taco Hole is a dimension located within our own universe and appears to be infinite in size.<br><br>The entrance to the Taco Hole can be found at any taco restaurant, regardless of size or location. Upon entering, individuals will find themselves in a large chamber filled with tacos of various sizes and shapes. All tacos appear to have been cooked perfectly and are ready for consumption.<br><br>Individuals who consume one or more tacos from within the Taco Hole will experience an intense euphoria that lasts approximately four hours before fading away completely. During this time, all physical needs (hunger, thirst etc.) are satisfied by consuming additional tacos from within the Taco Hole; however it has been observed that individuals who consume too many tacos can become ill due to overindulgence. Additionally, no matter how many tacos are consumed they will never run out; new ones simply appear when needed. <br><br>Once an individual has exited the Taco Hole they will not remember anything about their experience inside unless explicitly reminded by another person who was present during their visit; even then memories may still remain hazy at best due to a strong sense of cognitive dissonance associated with recollecting events inside the hole itself. <br><br>Attempts at mapping out or studying <i>SCP-19843</i> have been unsuccessful as it appears impossible for any living organism (or nonliving object) to leave its confines without first exiting through its entrance point; furthermore no attempt made so far has yielded any tangible results beyond what was initially described above<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-19843</i>, containment is impossible. All personnel are to be made aware of its existence and instructed not to enter any taco restaurant for any reason unless explicitly ordered by a Level 4 or higher personnel. Any individual found attempting to enter a taco restaurant without authorization is to be detained and questioned immediately.<br><br>In the event that an individual does manage to access <i>SCP-19843</i>, they are not allowed to leave until all effects of their experience have worn off completely; this includes any physical or mental changes caused by consuming tacos from within the Taco Hole itself.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19843.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a group of researchers attempted to enter <i>SCP-19843</i> in order to gain further insight into its properties. Upon entering the Taco Hole, all members of the research team were immediately overwhelmed by an intense feeling of euphoria and began consuming tacos at an alarming rate. After approximately two hours, all members of the research team had become comatose due to overindulgence and had to be removed from the Taco Hole via emergency medical transport. <br><br>It is currently unknown if any information was gathered during this incident or if any lasting effects remain on those involved; however it has been determined that attempting further exploration is ill advised until a safer method can be developed.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19843.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-19843</i><br><b><br>[Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████████]<br><b><br>[Subject:</b> D-19843-1]<br><b><br>Dr. ████████:</b> Can you tell me about your experience in the Taco Hole?<br><b><br>D-19843-1:</b> It was… strange. Everything seemed so surreal, like I was in a dream or something. The tacos were amazing though, and I felt really good after eating them. But then it all just stopped and I found myself back outside the restaurant again with no memory of what had happened inside.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19843.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/████, a team of four personnel were sent into the Taco Hole to investigate its properties. Upon entering, the team found themselves in a large chamber filled with tacos of various sizes and shapes. All tacos appeared to have been cooked perfectly and were ready for consumption. <br><br>The team was instructed to consume one taco each before returning back through the entrance point; however as soon as they began eating, all four personnel experienced an intense euphoria that lasted approximately four hours before fading away completely. After exiting the Taco Hole none of them could remember anything about their experience inside unless explicitly reminded by another person who was present during their visit; even then memories remained hazy at best due to a strong sense of cognitive dissonance associated with recollecting events inside the hole itself.</div>
