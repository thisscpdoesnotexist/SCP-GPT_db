This manipulation has been observed to cause objects and personnel within this area to experience extreme gravitational forces that can range from 0.1g up to 10g depending on the intensity of <i>SCP-18263</i>'s manipulation. It also appears capable of creating powerful shockwaves that can knock back or incapacitate any living being within its vicinity.<br><br>When threatened or provoked, <i>SCP-18263</i> will become hostile and will attempt to incapacitate any living beings nearby using its gravitational powers. It has also displayed an aversion towards light sources such as flashlights or spotlights, becoming agitated when exposed to them for extended periods of time.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18263</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be equipped with soundproofing and light dampening technology to prevent <i>SCP-18263</i> from becoming agitated.<br><br>Personnel assigned to <i>SCP-18263</i>'s containment are to wear protective gear when entering the chamber, as well as maintain a minimum distance of 10 meters from the entity at all times.
