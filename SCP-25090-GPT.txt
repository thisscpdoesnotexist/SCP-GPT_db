Where did it come from?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> We found it in an old abandoned building. We were told it was something special, that it could help us in our mission. So we took it and used it. It worked like a charm! No one got hurt, but we knew they would have if we had just used normal guns.<br><b><br>Agent ████████:</b> What do you mean by <i>"it worked like a charm"</i>?<br><b><br>Subject:</b> We used it to trick class-D personnel into killing two targets for us. They thought they were shooting at each other, but we had the gun pointed at them so that when they fired, they would receive all the injuries instead of their target.
