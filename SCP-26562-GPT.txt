    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-26562</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Keter</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-26562 is an anomalous entity that presents itself as a chalk outline reminiscent of those commonly used for crime scene investigations. Despite its non-sentient appearance, SCP-26562 exhibits highly aggressive and violent behavior, with the ability to transgress its two-dimensional boundary and affect the three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>When a living organism approaches within a 5-meter radius of SCP-26562, the entity becomes animate, stretching and contorting its outline in a manner inconsistent with physical laws. It shows a specific predilection for human targets, which results in immediate and intense homicidal aggression. It's theorized that SCP-26562 may possess the ability to absorb some form of energy or life essence from its victims, further increasing its strength and activity levels.</p>
<p>Actual contact with SCP-26562 has resulted in severe trauma or fatality for the individual involved. The mechanism of lethality appears to be the result of direct interaction with the outline, as victims have been found with chalk substance permeating their bodies at the cellular level, leading to catastrophic systemic failure.</p>
<p>Post-termination, SCP-26562 will revert to its inert state and relocate to a nearby surface, making containment a significant challenge. It is to be noted that SCP-26562 is not impeded by physical barriers when relocating.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Containment of SCP-26562 is currently focused on isolation and surveillance. The entity is located in a specially constructed underground facility 50 meters beneath [REDACTED], with no less than three security checkpoints with armed personnel. This facility is a 25-meter by 25-meter room lined with non-absorbent, highly durable synthetic material to mitigate relocation potential.</p>
<p>Access to SCP-26562 is strictly forbidden unless approved for testing by Level 4 personnel or higher. In the event of containment breach, Protocol Beta-4 ("Chalk Erasure") is to be initiated, involving the utilization of high-pressure hoses to dissolve SCP-26562's form and subsequently sanitize the area with a [REDACTED] solution to prevent immediate reforming.</p>
<p>To avoid triggering SCP-26562's aggression, perimeter sensors have been established to maintain a 10-meter exclusion zone, where no living organism is permitted. Any personnel breaching this zone without proper authorization will face severe disciplinary action and possible termination.</p>
