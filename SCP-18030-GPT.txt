Can yuo [sic] make it through all nine rooms of deadly terror????!!!! (well???)</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18030<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18030</i> is a large two-story mansion located in ██████, England. The exterior of the building appears to be in a state of disrepair, with broken windows and overgrown vegetation. Upon entering the building, all personnel are immediately overcome with an intense feeling of dread and fear.<br><br>The interior of <i>SCP-18030</i> is composed of nine rooms, each one more horrifying than the last. Each room contains various supernatural entities that will attempt to kill any intruders that enter them. These entities range from spectral figures to monstrous beasts capable of tearing through solid walls. It has been noted that these creatures are not affected by conventional weapons or methods; they can only be defeated through psychological means such as courage and determination.<br><br>It is currently unknown what lies at the end of <i>SCP-18030</i>'s ninth room; however, it is believed that those who make it through all nine rooms will gain knowledge beyond human comprehension or even immortality itself.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18030</i> is to be monitored by a team of at least four personnel at all times. All personnel entering <i>SCP-18030</i> must be equipped with standard issue protective gear and weapons. No personnel are to enter the ninth room without explicit permission from the Site Director.<br><br>Any entities encountered within <i>SCP-18030</i> are to be documented and reported to the Site Director immediately.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18030.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, personnel exploring <i>SCP-18030</i> encountered a humanoid entity in the sixth room. The entity was wearing a tattered black robe and had an unearthly pale complexion. It spoke in an ancient language that none of the personnel could understand, but its voice seemed to be filled with sorrow and despair. After several minutes of conversation, the entity vanished without a trace.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 18030.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18030</i>-1<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18030</i>-1 was recovered from the ninth room of <i>SCP-18030</i>. <i>SCP-18030</i>-1 is a Caucasian male in his late twenties who claims to have been living in the mansion for over twenty years. He has refused to divulge any information regarding what lies beyond the ninth room.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you tell us what lies beyond the ninth room?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18030</i>-1:</b> I'm sorry, but I can't. It's a secret that must remain hidden from the world. All I can say is that it's a place of unimaginable power and knowledge.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18030.3: </h3> Experiment Logs<br><b><br>Test 1:</b> Four personnel were sent into <i>SCP-18030</i>. All four were equipped with standard issue protective gear and weapons, as well as a camera to document the experiment. After entering the mansion, all four personnel quickly became overwhelmed by fear and dread and were unable to move forward. After two hours of attempting to progress further into the building, they all agreed that it was too dangerous and returned outside. No entities were encountered during this test.<br><b><br>Test 2:</b> Six personnel were sent in with similar equipment as before, however this time they had been given additional psychological training beforehand in order to better cope with the fear within <i>SCP-18030</i>. This test was successful; after an hour of exploration, one of the personnel made it through all nine rooms unscathed and emerged from the building seemingly unharmed but changed in some way (see Addendum 18030-2).</div>
