The bag is seemingly endless, with no upper or lower edge, although it has been proven not to extend outside its containment chamber. When <i>SCP-9467</i> is opened, a number of potato chips identical to those inside will be removed from within the bag until all space within the bag has been filled by the chips.<br><br>When one chip is removed from <i>SCP-9467</i>, it will disappear and another will take its place in roughly 1 second at random intervals; however, if all potato chips are removed from <i>SCP-9467</i> at once through any means other than consuming them entirely (such as crushing or burning), then none shall return when put back into <i>SCP-9467</i> after 24 hours. If one chip remains in the container for over twenty four hours without being consumed (through ingestion or other), then it will begin to multiply exponentially until they fill up an entire room measuring approximately 35m3 in size; this process can be stopped by removing all but one chip at once through any method that does not destroy them completely. Testing has shown that each individual instance created during this event originates from different parts of previously obliterated instances' bodies upon duplication;<br> for example: if part A was destroyed before part B was destroyed during an experiment where both were recovered intact prior to expiration ,<br> then both parts A and B would be duplicated into two new instances: A1 and B1 . This multiplication process never ends until either all chips have disappeared or they have successfully filled up their designated area with no extra space left over .<br><br>The remaining unfilled space left behind after completion of a duplication event contains data corresponding to every moment since their creation as separate objects.<br> Any attempts made so far to access this data directly have ended in failure due to several reasons: ~~<i>SCP-9463</i>'s data storage cannot be accessed normally through conventional means due to damage caused by previous experiments attempting direct access via computer systems (See Experiment Log 9463); ~~the information contained within these areas are not stored according to normal physical rules [DATA EXPUNGED]; ~~the information contained within these areas comprises every possible outcome that might result due to any choices available right up until when said outcomes become actualized physically on some level [DATA EXPUNGED].<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9467</i> was recovered from the home of ████ █████, who was arrested on charges of several counts of attempted homicide, assault and battery with a deadly weapon, vandalism and [REDACTED]. <i>SCP-9467</i> was discovered in a bag within one of the rooms during the investigation.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9467.1 :</h3> After <i>SCP-9463</i> came into contact with <i>SCP-9467</i>, the data storage of <i>SCP-9463</i> containing all holographic and digital records was damaged beyond repair. All information regarding [REDACTED] contained on the storage system was lost due to damage incurred as a result of contacting <i>SCP-9467</i>.<br><br><h3>Addendum 9467.2 :</h3> After <i>SCP-9463</i> came into contact with <i>SCP-9467</i>, the data storage of <i>SCP-9463</i> containing all holographic and digital records was damaged beyond repair.
