Access to <i>SCP-17048</i> is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Any experiments involving <i>SCP-17048</i> must be approved by a senior researcher and conducted under the supervision of at least two personnel.<br><br>In the event that an experiment produces an effect that cannot be contained, all personnel are to evacuate the area immediately and contact Site Command for further instructions.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-17048</i> is a set of six dice, each with a different color and design. The colors are blue, green, yellow, orange, red and purple. When rolled together in any combination or order, <i>SCP-17048</i> will cause an unpredictable effect to occur based on the number of dots showing on each die when it stops rolling.<br><br>The effects range from minor inconveniences such as objects moving around the room to more severe phenomena such as time manipulation or teleportation. These effects can last anywhere from seconds to minutes depending on their severity and duration cannot be predicted beforehand.<br><br>No pattern has been observed linking the numbers shown by <i>SCP-17048</i>'s dice with the type of effect that occurs afterwards; however, it appears that higher numbers tend to create stronger effects than lower ones. Furthermore, no two rolls have ever produced identical results thus far.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17048.1 : </h3><br><br>On ██/██/20██, a test was conducted to determine the effects of <i>SCP-17048</i> when rolled in different combinations. The results are as follows:<br><br>Roll 1 - Blue (3), Green (2), Yellow (5), Orange (4), Red (1) and Purple (6). <br><br><b>Result: </b>All personnel in the room experienced a sudden feeling of euphoria for approximately five minutes before returning to normal. <br><br>Roll 2 - Blue (4), Green (1), Yellow(6), Orange(2) , Red(3) and Purple(5). <br><br><b>Result: </b>A small tornado formed within the testing chamber, lasting for about two minutes before dissipating. <br><br>Roll 3 - Blue(5) ,Green(3) ,Yellow(1) ,Orange(6) ,Red(2 )and Purple 4 . <br><br><b>Result: </b>A portal opened up in the center of the room, leading to an unknown location that could not be accessed due to its instability.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17048.2 : </h3>Interview with  Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████, can you tell us what you know about <i>SCP-17048</i>?<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Well, it's a set of six dice that cause unpredictable effects when rolled together in any combination or order. The effects range from minor inconveniences to more severe phenomena such as time manipulation or teleportation. We haven't been able to determine any patterns linking the numbers shown by the dice with the type of effect that occurs afterwards, but higher numbers seem to create stronger effects than lower ones.<br><br><h3>Addendum 17048.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>17048-1: </b><br>Rolled <i>SCP-17048</i> with the following <br><br><b>combination: </b>Blue (3), Green (2), Yellow (5), Orange (4), Red (1) and Purple (6). <br><br><b>Result: </b>All personnel in the room experienced a sudden feeling of euphoria for approximately five minutes before returning to normal. <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>17048-2: </b><br>Rolled <i>SCP-17048</i> with the following <br><br><b>combination: </b>Blue(4) ,Green(1) ,Yellow(6) ,Orange(2 )Red(3 )and Purple 5 . <br><br><b>Result: </b>A small tornado formed within the testing chamber, lasting for about two minutes before dissipating. <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>17048-3: </b>Rolled <i>SCP-17048</i> with the following <br><br><b>combination: </b>Blue(5) ,Green(3) ,Yellow(1) ,Orange(6 )Red 2 and Purple 4 . <br><br><b>Result: </b>A portal opened up in the center of the room, leading to an unknown location that could not be accessed due to its instability.</div>
