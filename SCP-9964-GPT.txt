Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>So you're telling me that you just left a dangerous anomalous object unsupervised for several minutes and that's why we have an escaped SCP on our hands?! <br><br><b>Dr. ████████████: </b>It's not my fault! How many times do I have to tell you people that 99% of all anomalies are completely harmless? Agent <br><br><b>█████: </b>That's not what your record says… <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After reviewing Dr. [REDACTED]'s file, it has been decided that he will be demoted from his position as Site Director due to negligence and excessive force used against personnel under his command in previous years .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9964.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-9964</i> is to be placed in a standard containment cell. A single D-Class personnel is to enter the containment cell and attempt to retrieve <i>SCP-9964</i>. The D-Class personnel will then be instructed to exit the containment cell with <i>SCP-9964</i>, with armed guards instructed not to intervene unless absolutely necessary. After exiting the containment cell, the D-Class personnel will be given a small piece of paper and told that he or she can use it for whatever purpose they desire, but must not burn it or tear it apart. The paper is then removed from their possession and incinerated in front of them after they have been escorted back into their holding room. Once all relevant data has been recorded, all data regarding this experiment are to be destroyed using standard methods. All test subjects involved in this experiment are currently awaiting termination by lethal injection at Site 19's onsite morgue facility following completion of testing procedures.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately 2 minutes of waiting inside the containment chamber, <i>SCP-9964</i> began emitting a loud squealing noise that lasted approximately 30 seconds before stopping completely without warning . Approximately 15 seconds later , several armed guards were instructed into the chamber by Dr ██████ via radio communication equipment while simultaneously being observed through CCTV surveillance equipment located inside an adjacent observation room . Upon entering the chamber , one guard immediately noticed that <i>SCP-9964</i> had vanished entirely despite having been previously observed laying directly underneath its designated pillow within its designated pillowcase . A search was immediately initiated for <i>SCP-9964</i>'s whereabouts but was fruitless due to [DATA EXPUNGED] until further notice under order from O5 Command . In light of recent events regarding Experiment #1 , any further experimentation involving direct interaction between human subjects and SCP objects are strictly forbidden until further notice under order from O5 Command . All test subjects involved in this experiment are currently awaiting termination by lethal injection at Site 19's onsite morgue facility following completion of testing procedures .<br><br></div>
