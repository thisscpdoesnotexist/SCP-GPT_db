Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b><i>SCP-15663</i>: </b>My name is ███ ███████, sir! <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then… So ███, where are you from? Where did you come from? <i>SCP-15663</i> (answering in Urdu): I am from Pakistan sir! I was born there and raised there! My family still lives there now! They don't know about me though… They think I'm dead… But that's not important right now! What's important is that you tell me what happened to my family after they found out I died! You see they sold my body as a statue because they thought it would bring them good luck or some bullcrap like that but it didn't work so they had no use for me anymore so they just threw me away like trash and left me in a dumpster on the side of the road as if I were nothing more than garbage!! That's not fair!! How could you do this?? How could you let this happen!? They're supposed to love their children no matter what!! The least they could've done was give me a proper burial but oh nooo!!! Instead of doing that all they did was throw my body away like garbage!!! And then when someone found out about what happened all he did was sell off my body parts one by one without even asking them first!!! He even sold off my head without telling them first!!!! And then he cut off his own hand with an axe because he felt guilty about doing such a thing!!! That's not fair at all!!! He should've just given back what he stole from us instead of cutting his own hand off!!!! It doesn't make sense why anyone would do something like that unless something really bad has happened to him in his life before this incident occurred!!!!! Oh god…. Oh god…. Oh god…….. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing this information we sent agents into Pakistan in order find out more information on 15662' family members and if any other incidents have occurred involving 15662' father or brother before 15662 turned into an anomaly .
