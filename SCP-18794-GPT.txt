<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-18794 is  a method to change reality and make any spoken statement true by following it with "You heard it straight from the horse's mouth."</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18794<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18794</i> is an anomalous phenomenon that causes any statement made by a human subject to become true if it is followed by the phrase <i>"You heard it straight from the horse's mouth"</i>. This effect applies to statements of fact and opinion, as well as commands.<br><br>The effect of <i>SCP-18794</i> appears to be instantaneous, with no visible changes in the environment or other observable phenomena occurring. However, events will occur shortly after a statement has been made which are consistent with what was stated. For example, if a subject were to state <i>"I can fly"</i>, they would immediately begin flying without any apparent means of propulsion.<br><br>It should be noted that <i>SCP-18794</i> does not appear to affect non-human subjects; only humans are affected by this phenomenon. Furthermore, <i>SCP-18794</i> does not appear to work on statements which contradict known physical laws or those which would otherwise be impossible for a single individual (such as <i>"all humans will now cease existing"</i>).<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18794</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be monitored at all times for any signs of anomalous activity. Any personnel entering the containment area must be briefed on the effects of <i>SCP-18794</i> and instructed to refrain from making statements which could potentially cause an uncontrolled reality alteration event.<br><br>In the event that an uncontrolled reality alteration occurs, MTF Epsilon-6 (<i>"Reality Benders"</i>) is to be dispatched immediately to contain and reverse any changes caused by <i>SCP-18794</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18794.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a containment breach occurred at Site-██ due to the effects of <i>SCP-18794</i>. During the incident, one (1) personnel was killed and several others were injured. The cause of the breach is believed to have been an experiment conducted by Dr. ██████ in which he attempted to use <i>SCP-18794</i> to alter reality in order to create a <i>"perfect world"</i>. After containment was reestablished, all personnel involved in the incident were administered Class A amnestics and reassigned.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18794.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18794</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-18794</i> was interviewed by Dr. ███████ in order to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon. The following is a transcript of the interview.<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Good morning, <i>SCP-18794</i>. How are you feeling today?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18794</i>:</b> I'm feeling great! You heard it straight from the horse's mouth.<br><b><br>Dr. ███████:</b> Interesting. Can you tell me more about this phenomenon?<br><b><br><i>SCP-18794</i>:</b> Sure! Basically, anything I say becomes true if I follow it with <i>"You heard it straight from the horse's mouth"</i>. It doesn't matter what it is - facts, opinions, commands - as long as I say that phrase at the end of my sentence, whatever I said will come true. You heard it straight from the horse's mouth.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18794.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>Test A - D-8794 was instructed to state <i>"I am the President of the United States"</i>.<br><b>Result:</b> D-8794 immediately began exhibiting behaviors consistent with those of a US president, including signing executive orders and making public appearances. Reality alteration event successfully reversed by MTF Epsilon-6.</div>
