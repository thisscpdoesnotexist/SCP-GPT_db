As in, a pit full of arms.</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-18252<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-18252</i> is a large, subterranean pit located in an unspecified location. The pit is filled with humanoid arms of various sizes and shapes, all of which appear to be alive. The arms are capable of independent movement and communicate through a series of gestures and vocalizations.<br><br>The arms are constantly attempting to climb out of the pit, though they lack the necessary strength or coordination to do so. Any attempts by personnel to enter the pit will result in <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms attacking them with extreme force and ferocity.<br><br>Attempts at communication have been met with hostility from <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms, leading researchers to conclude that they possess some level of sapience or intelligence. As such, it is believed that <i>SCP-18252</i> may be sentient in some form or another; however, this has yet to be confirmed conclusively.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18252</i> is to be contained in a reinforced concrete bunker, with the entrance sealed off by a steel door. The bunker should be monitored at all times for any signs of activity from <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms.<br><br>In the event that personnel need to enter the pit, they must wear protective gear and use nonlethal force against <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms. Any attempts at communication should be done through gestures or vocalizations only; no physical contact is allowed under any circumstances.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18252.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms. After several hours of communication, the team was able to ascertain that the arms were attempting to escape from their confinement in order to reach a <i>"promised land"</i> beyond the pit.<br><br>The exact location and nature of this promised land is unknown; however, it is believed that it may be related to some form of afterlife or spiritual realm. Further research into this matter is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18252.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-18252</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms. The following is a transcript of the conversation that ensued:<br><b><br>[BEGIN LOG]<br>Personnel:</b> Hello? Can you understand me?<br><b><i>SCP-18252</i> Arms:</b> [The arms gesture angrily and emit a series of vocalizations.] <br><b>Personnel:</b> We mean you no harm. We just want to talk. <br><b><i>SCP-18252</i> Arms:</b> [The arms cease their aggressive gestures and vocalizations, but remain suspicious.] <br><b>Personnel:</b> What do you want? Why are you here? <br><b><i>SCP-18252</i> Arms:</b> [The arms gesture towards the sky.]<br><b><br>Personnel:</b> Are you trying to escape? <br><b><i>SCP-18252</i> Arms:</b> [The arms gesture affirmatively.] <br><b>Personnel:</b> Do you know how? <br><b><i>SCP-18252</i> Arms:</b> [The arms gesture towards the sky again, then point at personnel.] <br>[END LOG]<br><br>Analysis of the conversation suggests that <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms are attempting to escape their containment by some unknown means, and that they may possess a rudimentary understanding of human language. Further research is needed in order to determine the true nature and purpose of <i>SCP-18252</i>.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18252.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-93722<br><b>Procedure:</b> D-93722 was instructed to enter the pit and attempt to communicate with <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms.<br><b>Results:</b> Upon entering the pit, D-93722 was immediately set upon by <i>SCP-18252</i>'s arms. Despite his attempts at communication, he was unable to make any progress in establishing a dialogue before being overwhelmed and dragged back out of the pit.</div>
