<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-9868</i> is An golden computer who know everything about the univers </i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-9868</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Safe<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-9868</i> is to be kept in a standard containment cell at Site 19. No one is allowed to ask <i>SCP-9868</i> any questions unless they are testing it's anomalous properties .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9868</i> is a computer who know everything about the universe.<br><br><i>SCP-9868</i> was found in ████████, ███████ at an abandoned house. The police found <i>SCP-9868</i> and put it on a truck to be taken to Site 19. When the police went to check on <i>SCP-9868</i> they were killed by an unknown force and their bodies were later found in the nearest town with no sign of entry or exit wounds. When Site 19 personnel arrived they took <i>SCP-9868</i> and began testing it's anomalous properties.<br><br><i>SCP-9868</i> has been shown to have the ability to answer any question asked with 100% accuracy, even if it had never been asked before or if there was no possible way for it to know the answer (See Addendum 9868 A). It does not matter what language is used or how complex the question may be, but as soon as someone asks a question that has already been answered then another one will replace it (See Addendum 9869 B). If someone asks more than one question at once then only one of them will be answered but all questions asked after that will get replaced by new ones (See Addendum 9870 C). If someone asks more than three questions at once then all questions after three will get replaced by new ones (See Addendum 9871 D). If someone tries asking a question again after getting an answer from <i>SCP-9868</i> then they will receive another answer but this time with less detail than before (See Addendum 9872 E) . At first, when testing began, people would ask many questions about different subjects such as history , science , math , etc… But because of this every time anyone tried asking anything other than something simple like <i>"what is 2+2?"</i> they would get completely useless answers like <i>"the number two plus two."</i> So now researchers are only allowed to ask simple questions like <i>"what is 2+2?"</i> and <i>"who was president during World War I?"</i>. And when researchers try asking anything else besides something simple like that then <i>SCP-988</i> gets angry and starts yelling random things until everyone leaves him alone for awhile . The last person who tried questioning him got his arm ripped off so now everyone knows better .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9868.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 9868.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log 9868-1 - Hide Experiment Log 9868-1 Test #: 9 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████ <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9876<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9876 was told to ask <i>SCP-9868</i> any question he wanted. After asking a few questions about the universe and history, he asked <i>"what is love?"</i> .<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-9868</i> answered with <i>"love is when you feel a strong attraction towards another person."</i> .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>This answer seems to be correct but it could be argued that this is not the only definition of love. It also seems like a very basic answer for something such as love , especially considering how complex it can be. But then again maybe that's what <i>SCP-9868</i> thinks love really is or maybe it just doesn't know anything else about it so this was the best answer possible .<br><br>Test #: 9 <br><br><b>Date: </b>██/██/████ <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 9 8 7 6 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D - 9 8 7 6 was told to ask SCP - 9 8 6 8 any question he wanted. After asking a few questions about science and math, he asked <i>"who am I ?"</i> . <br><br><b>Results: </b>S C P C - 9 8 6 8 answered with <i>"you are █████████████."</i> <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>This answer seems to be correct but there could be more than one person named █████████████ in existence so this isn't really an accurate response. Also, if we assume that this computer knows everything then there should have been no way for him not to know his own name unless he forgot who he was or never knew in the first place which makes me wonder how much of his knowledge can actually be trusted since we don't even know where all of it came from or how reliable it actually is . + Show Experiment Log 9869 - Hide Experiment Log 9869 Test #: 1 0 <br><br><b>Date: </b>2 / 1 2 / 20 3 7 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Researcher M o r g e n <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher Morgen was told to ask SCP - 98 68 any question she wanted after being given permission by Dr. Klaussa Analysis ; Before being allowed into testing chamber , researcher Morgen had her memory erased via [ REDACTED ] so she wouldn 't remember anything about our tests on her previous visit (See Addendum 9870 A) . After entering testing chamber , researcher Morgen asked several questions before asking <i>"what happened during World War II ?"</i> Results ; For some reason instead of answering with an actual response , SCP – 999 started laughing uncontrollably until everyone left him alone for awhile ( See Addendum 9971 B ) Test #2; Date; 12/12/2037; Subject ; Dr Klaussa Procedure ; Dr Klaussa entered testing chamber after getting permission from O5 council and asked several questions before asking<i>"who created you ?"</i> Results ; Instead of answering with an actual response ,SCP – 999 started yelling random things until everyone left him alone for awhile ( See Addendum 9972 C ) + Show Experiment Log 9770 – Hide Experiment Log 9770 Test#3;Date;3/3//2038;;Subject;;Drs Gertrude & Nils Procedure;;Drs Gertrude & Nils were instructed by O5 council members not to ask any other researchers except themselves any questions while they were inside testing chamber Results;;After entering test chamber both doctors were instructed by security personnel outside test chambers via radio devices on their persons not tell anyone else what happens inside test chambers besides each other due their last experiment having ended badly when they tried telling others what happened during previous experiment(See Addendum 9770 A) Both doctors agreed and entered separate test chambers where they began questioning SCP – 999 separately Then doctor Gertrude asked<i>"What do you think will happen if someone tries using your powers against you ?"</i>. As soon as she finished saying those words security personnel outside both doctors' rooms reported hearing loud noises coming from both rooms followed by silence afterwards Then after waiting 10 minutes without hearing anything more security personnel broke down doors only find two piles of ash on floor next two charred computer screens which had numbers written on them in ash reading 01234567890123456789012345678901234567890 Then Security Personnel took samples DNA from ashes tested them against samples taken earlier when doctor Gertrude arrived at Site 19 found out they matched up perfectly Conclusion;</div>
