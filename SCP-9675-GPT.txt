It's nice to meet you! What would you like to ask me?<br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Well, first of all, what is your name?<br><b> <i>SCP-9675</i>:</b> My name is [REDACTED] but my grandson calls me grandpa! He's such a sweet boy too! Always makes sure that I'm happy and healthy! We go on adventures together all the time too! He's so smart for his age too! He knows how to make portals with his portal gun just like me when he was little too but now he can't because he grew up and became a big boy now but it doesn't matter because we still have fun together anyways even if we can't go on adventures anymore because of him growing up into a big boy now but it doesn't matter because we still have fun anyways even if we can't go on adventures anymore because of him growing up into a big boy now but it doesn't matter because… <End Log><br><b> Closing Statement:</b> After that interview, <i>SCP-9665</i> was given food and water for sustenance before being put back in containment until further notice.<br><br><h3><br><b>Addendum 9675.2 :</b></h3> <i>SCP-9675</i>'s Interview<br><br><br><b>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-9675</i> </b> <br> <b><br><b>Interviewer:</b>  Dr. ██████ </b> <br> <b><br><b>Foreword:</b></b> This is an interview with <i>SCP-9675</i>, who was found in the middle of the woods, where he was trying to find his way back home. <Begin Log><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Hello <i>SCP-9675</i>, my name is Dr. ██████ and I will be asking you some questions about yourself and your grandson for the foundation records. Can you tell me what your name is?<br><b> <i>SCP-9665</i>:</b> My name? Oh yes! My name is [REDACTED] but most people call me grandpa!<br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Ok thank you for telling me that now can you tell me how old are you?<br><b> <i>SCP-9665</i>:</b> I'm a very old man! I'm at least a hundred years old if not older! But my grandson here is only twenty years old so he's not as old as I am yet! He still has a lot of growing up to do before he can be as smart or wise as his grandfather though!<br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> That's interesting… Now can you tell us where were you born at? Where did your parents live at when they gave birth to you? And what were their names if possible please? <<i>SCP-9665</i> pauses for 5 seconds><br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9665</i> :</b> Oh yes… Well my parents lived in [DATA EXPUNGED]. They raised me there until they died from cancer when I was around thirty years old or so… It was very sad day indeed but it had to happen sometime right?! After that happened, I decided to move out of town and go on adventures with my grandson here because it would be too boring staying there all by myself without anyone else around except for him after all these years of being alone since everyone else left town after my parents died… So we decided to go on adventures together instead because we both like doing stuff like this together anyways ever since we first met each other when he was just a little boy back then… He always wanted someone like his grandfather around him ever since then and now that wish came true thanks to our portal gun which let us travel into different dimensions whenever we want too without having any problems or worries about anything bad happening while doing so which makes it even better than traveling through time itself in many ways because time travel has its own problems too don't ya think?!<br><br><br><b>Dr . ████ :</b> Yes…. Yes it does have its own problems indeed…. Now can yo utell us how did y ou get y our portal gun please ?<br><br><br><b>SCP - 9 6 7 5 :</b> Well , one day while walking through the forest near my house , i found this strange looking device laying on top of some leaves near by . At first i thought nothing of it until i picked up this device and started playing with it . After playing with this device for awhile , i realized that something special about this device … It could open portals ! So after figuring out how t o use t his new f un toy , i started using t his new toy everywhere i went ! It made going places much easier than walking everywhere ! Plus going places faster means less time wasted waiting around doing nothing which means more adventures could be done during each day instead ! Plus going places faster also means less chances getting lost along the way which helps too … A lot … A whole lot actually … Because getting lost sucks big time especially when trying finding your way home again afterwards … Trust me on that one cause i've been lost many times before while traveling through dimensions before meeting up with him again later on again later down the road somewhere else along our journey together thanks to our portal gun here which helped save us from getting lost along the way many times over during our travels across multiple dimensions together over all these years now ever since we first met each other back then long ago in another dimension far far away from here long ago long ago long ago long ago lonnnngggg aggoooooooo…….. <End Log><br><b> Closing Statement::</b> After hearing what SCP - 9675 had said during questioning, The foundation decided not put him under any form of containment due to lack information about its creator(s) or creation date due lack information about either subject matter currently available within Foundation records database system files regarding either subject matter currently available within Foundation records database system files regarding either subject matter currently available within Foundation records database system files regarding either</div>
