<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-25204 is  the branch of antiphysics</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-25204<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-25204</i> is a branch of physics that operates on the principles of antiphysics, which are contrary to those of normal physics. It has been observed to produce effects that appear to be impossible when compared with traditional laws and theories. These include, but are not limited to:<br><br>• The ability to create matter from nothingness.<br>• Manipulation of time and space in ways that contradict accepted scientific principles.<br>• Alteration or reversal of physical laws such as gravity and inertia.<br>• Creation or manipulation of energy without any known source or cause. <br>• The alteration or disruption of natural phenomena such as weather patterns and electromagnetic fields. <br>Research into <i>SCP-25204</i> is ongoing, however its applications remain largely theoretical due to the difficulty in controlling its effects reliably and safely.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-25204</i> is to be contained in a secure research facility at Site-███. Access to the facility is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. All experiments involving <i>SCP-25204</i> must be approved by the O5 Council prior to commencement.<br><br>Any attempts at using <i>SCP-25204</i> for non-research purposes are strictly forbidden and will result in disciplinary action.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25204.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an experiment was conducted in which <i>SCP-25204</i> was used to create a small pocket of space that existed outside of normal reality. Within this pocket, several anomalous phenomena were observed, including the formation of a miniature black hole and the spontaneous generation of energy. The experiment was terminated shortly thereafter due to safety concerns.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25204.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ███████<br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ███████<br><b>Interviewed:</b> Dr. ███████, researcher of <i>SCP-25204</i><br>&ltBegin Log&gt <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> So, what have you been working on lately? <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> I've been researching the potential applications of <i>SCP-25204</i> and its effects on the physical world around us. It's a fascinating field of study, but also one that is fraught with danger due to its unpredictable nature and lack of control mechanisms. <br><b>Interviewer:</b> What sort of applications do you think it could be used for? <br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> Well, there are several potential uses for this branch of antiphysics. For example, it could be used to create new forms of energy or matter from nothingness, manipulate time and space in ways that are not possible with traditional physics, or even alter physical laws such as gravity and inertia. In addition, it could potentially be used to disrupt natural phenomena such as weather patterns and electromagnetic fields. <br><b>Interviewer:</b> What sort of risks do you think are associated with using <i>SCP-25204</i>?<br><b>Dr. ███████:</b> The main risk is the lack of control over its effects; we don't know how they will manifest or what the consequences might be if something goes wrong. It's also important to remember that this branch of antiphysics operates on principles that contradict those of normal physics, so there is always the risk of unexpected and potentially dangerous outcomes. <br>&ltEnd Log&gt <br><b>Closing Statement:</b> Dr. ███████ expressed a cautious optimism regarding the potential of <i>SCP-25204</i>, but also warned of its inherent risks and dangers.<br><br><h3> Addendum 25204.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 25204-1:</b> <br><b>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-Class personnel (Designation D-25204)<br><b>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to attempt to use <i>SCP-25204</i> to create a small sphere of light. <br><b>Result:</b> After several minutes, the subject succeeded in producing a glowing orb of light approximately 1 meter in diameter. The orb remained stable for approximately 2 minutes before dissipating.</div>
