Any personnel who come into contact with <i>SCP-15294</i> instances are to be given class A amnestics and have their memories of the event erased .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15294</i> is a collection of 1,000,000+ video game ROMs and their respective emulators. Instances of <i>SCP-15294</i> are spread across the internet and can be found on various websites such as Archive.Org, Google Drive and Dropbox.<br><br><i>SCP-15294</i> instances can be downloaded onto any device with a functioning CPU and Internet connection. <i>SCP-15294</i> instances will begin to download onto the device they were downloaded from after 5 minutes of being opened. Instances will remain on devices until removed by an individual who is aware that they are <i>SCP-15294</i> or if the device is turned off for more than 8 hours at a time . If an individual who has never heard of or seen <i>SCP-15294</i> attempts to open an instance then it will not become part of the collection .<br><br><i>SCP-15294</i> instances have anomalous properties when played in succession with other instances . After playing one instance for 10 minutes , an individual's perception will begin to shift towards that particular instance . The perception shift becomes more severe depending on how many times you play each instance consecutively (see Addendum 15294 A). When playing multiple copies simultaneously , individuals' perceptions will switch between each copy every ten minutes (See Addendum 152944). After 30 minutes , subjects' perceptions become entirely focused around that particular game until it is stopped (See Experiment Log 152944). Subjects report feeling <i>"out of place"</i> while under this effect but do not show any signs of distress or discomfort unless forcibly interrupted from playing them (See Experiment Log 152944). If subjects are interrupted during this state they may become hostile toward whoever interrupted them and try to resume play as soon as possible (See Experiment Log 152945). Subjects also appear unable to remember anything about themselves outside their gaming habits except for facts about their favorite games(See Interview Log 152945) . This effect can last up to 24 hours before wearing off completely but may also be ended prematurely by removing all copies from memory storage devices(see experiment log 153194)or by destroying all copies in close proximity(see experiment log 153195) . During experimentation involving multiple copies, researchers have noted that there appears to be some sort of hierarchy based on when each copy was obtained with newer ones taking precedence over older ones.(see interview log 153196 ) It should also be noted that if two people attempt to play different games without knowing what they are doing then both individuals experience similar effects regardless which game was chosen first.( see<br><br><h3>Addendum 15294.1 : </h3> <br><br>On ██/██/████, a group of D-class personnel were told about <i>SCP-15294</i> and were given a copy of it. After playing for 30 minutes, all subjects began to show signs of distress and tried to leave the testing chamber. They were stopped by security and questioned on their actions. All subjects showed no knowledge as to why they attempted to leave the room or why they felt distressed but stated that they felt <i>"out of place"</i> while playing <i>SCP-15294</i> . All subjects also displayed an inability to remember anything outside their gaming habits except for facts about their favorite games (See Interview Log 152945). This effect lasted up to 24 hours before wearing off completely .<br><br><h3>Addendum 15294.2 : </h3>Interview with ███████ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███████ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b><i>SCP-15294</i>-A is a copy of the game <i>"The Legend Of Zelda"</i> and was obtained from <i>SCP-15294</i> on 9/1/2013. The subject has been playing it for over 20 years and has beaten the game multiple times . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>Hello, Mr.███████, how are you doing today?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15294</i>-A: </b>I'm fine…I guess…I just don't understand why I'm here…<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>You were brought in to answer some questions about your favorite video games .<br><br><b><i>SCP-15294</i>-A: </b>Oh yeah, that's right! I remember now! So what do you want to know?<br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>First off , can you tell me about this game? What is it called ? How did you get it ? Why do you like it so much ? <i>SCP-15294</i> - A: It's called <i>"The Legend Of Zelda"</i>. I got it when my parents bought me a Nintendo 64 for my birthday back in 1997 . And I like it because of all the cool stuff they put into this one ! Like all the different items and weapons ! And there are tons of different dungeons with puzzles that get harder as you go along! <br><br><b>Dr. █████████: </b>That sounds great ! Now , can we talk about something else ? This game seems to be very important to you but we need to focus on other things right now . SCP - 15294 - A: Sure thing doc ! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After interview, subject was given class B amnestics and released back into his normal life without any memory of being interviewed or anything related to SCP - 15295 or its effects (See Addendum 152944).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15294.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment Log 15294-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15294, Male, age 34.

Subject has never played video games before but knows about <i>SCP-15294</i>'s anomalous properties from a previous experiment involving it (see Addendum 152944). <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as experiment log above except with two instances of <i>SCP-15294</i> instead of one <br><br><b>Results: </b>After playing for 10 minutes , subject began showing signs of distress and tried leaving the testing chamber . When asked what was wrong , subject said he felt <i>"out of place"</i> while playing it . When questioned further on his statement , subject replied that he had a hard time focusing on anything other than his perception shift between both instances while playing them simultaneously(see interview log 153196) <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that multiple copies do not need direct contact with each other in order for this effect occur between them.(See Interview Log 153196) Experiment Log 152945 -1: <br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D Class personnel (6), male, ages 29 - 37 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subjects were told about <i>SCP-15295</i>'s anomalous properties and then given a copy each along with instructions telling them how to use emulators if needed( see addendum 153195 ). They were then told not play any game until further notice from researchers and left alone in a room together for 24 hours without food or water until hunger became unbearable( See interview log 153196 ). <br><br><b>Results: </b>After 12 hours passed all subjects began showing signs of distress at around the same time despite being isolated from each other during experimentation . They showed no knowledge as if why they were distressed but stated that they felt <i>"out of place"</i> while playing them simultaneously(See Interview Log 153197). The subjects eventually started begging researchers through messages written on scraps paper left around the room begging us not let them continue feeling like this anymore.( See message logs ) <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that multiple copies do not need direct contact with each other in order for this effect occur between them.(See Message logs) Experiment Log 152945 -2 <br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D Class personnel (6), male, ages 29 - 37 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Same as experiment log above except instead using different copies <br><br><b>Results: </b>After 12 hours passed all subjects began showing signs of distress at around the same time despite being isolated from each other during experimentation . They showed no knowledge as if why they were distressed but stated that they felt <i>"out of place"</i> while playing them simultaneously(See Interview Log 153197). The effects seemed more severe than previous tests however when asked how long it had been since we last talked , all six subjects gave different answers ranging anywhere from 5 seconds up till 3 days even though only 1 hour had actually passed since we last talked with them( see message logs ) Analysis if there is any relation between these results is currently pending due to conflicting research data acquired so far regarding its effects.( See Addendum153194 ) Analysis Message logs Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Test 4 Test 5 Test 6 I can't take much more please help me I don't want my perception shifting anymore I feel like im going insane Please make it stop I dont know whats happening anymore please help me Make it stop Make it stop Make i t s t o p m e s s a g e f r o m d e c o d i n g… … … … … … [UNKNOWN MESSAGE] f r o m d e c o d i n g… … [UNKNOWN MESSAGE] f r o m d e c o d i n g… [UNKNOWN</div>
