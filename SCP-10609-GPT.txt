What do you want to know? <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>First of all, what is your name? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10609</i>: </b>My name's Alan! Or Al for short! What about you Doc? You got a name or are we just gonna keep calling you <i>"Doc"</i>? Dr. ██████ chuckles slightly before responding 'Dr.' will do fine… Now then Alan, can you tell me where exactly it was that the Foundation found you? (<i>SCP-10609</i> takes a moment to think) No problemo Doc! I was out on my boat fishing when those guys pulled up and started tying me up and such like that! They took me back to their base and asked me some questions but they were kinda rude so I didn't answer any of them! Then they locked me in this room with these weird crab things everywhere and told me not to leave or else they'd shoot the crabs at my feet off or something like that… So anyway after about three days one of them came in here with this big needle thingy and stuck it into my arm… And then everything went black… And now here we are talking about it right now!!! (At this point Dr.) Oh yes well thank you very much for your time Alan but if there is nothing else can I ask if there is anything else that happened while in their custody that could help us better understand what happened during your stay there? (<i>SCP-10609</i> pauses briefly) Oh yeah one other thing did happen while I was there actually…. It wasn't too long after they gave me the shot did all these little crabs start crawling out from under my skin…. It hurt like hell but once they were all out of my body it stopped hurting so bad…. But man oh man did those suckers itch!!! Anyways thanks again for asking doc maybe next time we can talk about something more fun!! Like fishing maybe?! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>Afterword 10608 continued its attempts at conversation despite being told not too by staff members present during the interview repeatedly .<br><br><h3>Addendum 10609.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br>Experiment 10609-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10609</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-class personnel are to be introduced into <i>SCP-10609</i>'s containment cell for testing. Results are to be recorded by video camera and audio recorder.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-class personnel were introduced into the containment cell, and immediately began to act erratically, flailing around and making random noises.

The subject then proceeded towards one of them , who had not moved away from it . It grabbed him with its claws , lifted him off his feet , brought him close enough so that they could smell each others' breath , then bit off his head . The rest of the subjects ran out of the chamber screaming . Video footage shows that this was done in a manner resembling affectionate behavior between crabs .</div>
