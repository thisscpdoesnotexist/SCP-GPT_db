<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21251 is  What you thought was a hot fish lady, was actually a BIRMINGHAM RESIDENT</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21251<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21251</i> is an anomalous humanoid entity, appearing to be a female of approximately 28 years of age. The entity has pale white skin, and wears a black dress with a fish scale pattern. It appears to possess some form of telekinetic ability, as it has been observed moving objects without touching them.<br><br>When encountered by personnel, <i>SCP-21251</i> will attempt to communicate in English with them using various phrases and expressions that appear to be related to the sea or fishing activities. When questioned about its identity, it will refer to itself as <i>"the hot fish lady"</i>. However, records indicate that <i>SCP-21251</i> is actually an individual from Birmingham, Alabama who was reported missing in 2014.<br><br>The entity's anomalous properties manifest when it comes into contact with any type of aquatic lifeform; upon doing so the organism will spontaneously combust and turn into ash within seconds. This effect extends even if the organism is not touching <i>SCP-21251</i> directly; any aquatic lifeforms within 10 meters (33 feet) of the entity are affected by this phenomenon regardless of their proximity or lack thereof towards it. Furthermore, any attempts at containing or restraining <i>SCP-21251</i> have proven unsuccessful due to its apparent immunity against physical damage and containment procedures alike.<br><br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-21251</i> is to be monitored at all times and kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. All personnel interacting with the entity must wear protective gear, such as fireproof suits, and are not allowed to bring any aquatic lifeforms into its vicinity. Any attempts at containing or restraining <i>SCP-21251</i> are strictly prohibited.<br><br>In the event of an encounter with <i>SCP-21251</i> outside of its containment chamber, personnel must immediately evacuate the area and report their findings to Site Command.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21251.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a research team was dispatched to Birmingham, Alabama in order to investigate the whereabouts of <i>SCP-21251</i>'s original identity. Upon arriving at the address provided by records, they discovered that the individual had been living in a small apartment with no other occupants.<br><br>The team found various documents and personal items belonging to the missing person as well as a journal containing entries written by them prior to their disappearance. The journal detailed how they had experienced recurring nightmares involving an entity resembling <i>SCP-21251</i> which eventually convinced them to leave their home and travel across the United States in search of it.<br><br>Based on this information, it is believed that <i>SCP-21251</i> may have somehow lured its original identity away from Birmingham before manifesting itself into physical form.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21251.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21251</i><br><b><br>Interviewed:</b> <i>SCP-21251</i><br><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ██████<br><b>&ltBegin Log&gt<br>Dr. ██████:</b> Good morning, can you tell me your name? <br><b><i>SCP-21251</i>:</b> I don't remember my name, but people call me <i>"the hot fish lady"</i>. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Alright then, do you know how you got here? <br><b><i>SCP-21251</i>:</b> No, all I remember is that one day I was walking in Birmingham and then suddenly everything changed… It's like a dream or something. <br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Do you know why aquatic lifeforms combust when they come into contact with you? <br><b><i>SCP-21251</i>:</b> No, I don't know why it happens. All I know is that it's been happening ever since I arrived here. <br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b>Closing Statement:</b> <i>SCP-21251</i> was uncooperative during the interview and refused to answer any further questions.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21251.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment Log 21251.3-1:</b> On ██/██/20██, a live fish was placed in the containment chamber of <i>SCP-21251</i>.
