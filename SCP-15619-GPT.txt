Testing is currently suspended until further notice.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15619</i> is a non-euclidean structure that can only be seen from one side. When viewed from the other side, it appears to be an ordinary ring.<br><br><i>SCP-15619</i> was recovered in [REDACTED] after reports of a <i>"rotating ring"</i> were made by residents of the area. <i>SCP-15619</i> was found in the basement of ██████ █████████, who claimed to have no knowledge of its origins or how it came into his possession.<br><br><i>SCP-15619</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is worn by a human being and rotated at least once every 24 hours. After this time, <i>SCP-15619</i> will start rotating on its own at an average speed of 1 revolution per hour (1 rph). It will continue to rotate indefinitely until removed from the wearer's finger or destroyed. The object is not damaged by this rotation and can be worn normally while rotating with no adverse effects on health or comfort level; however, any attempts to stop or slow down the rotation will fail unless done so via direct physical contact with <i>SCP-15619</i> itself (see Experiment Log 15619). This has proven difficult due to <i>SCP-15619</i>'s location within most subjects' fingers; however, several methods have been devised for accomplishing this task during testing (see Addendum 15619). Once removed from the wearer's finger and separated from them for more than 2 hours , <i>SCP-15621</i> will return to its original orientation as seen from behind . Any attempts made after this point to reorient it are met with failure . If left unattended for more than 2 days without being rotated , SCP - 156 19 wi ll begin turning on its own at 1 r p h , but wi ll st o p do w n if t he wea r er i s i n vi si bl e t o th e ob j ec t .

He was then ordered to stop the rotation of <i>SCP-15619</i> by any means necessary. On the following day, he was ordered to put on <i>SCP-15619</i> once again and attempt to restart its rotation. <br><br><b>Results: </b>At precisely 8 am on ██/██/████, D-94521 reported that he could see <i>SCP-15619</i> rotating while facing him from behind his back; however, when asked if he could feel or hear any abnormal activity in his finger (which is where the object resided at this time), he claimed that nothing out of the ordinary occurred. When questioned about how he stopped its rotation yesterday, D - 9452 1 sta ted tha t h e wa s ab l e t o se e th e ob j ec t ro ti ng fr om be hi nd hi m wh en i t wa s r ot at in g , bu t not wh en i ts r ot at io n wa s st op pe d .

It remains unknown how this happened or why this occurred only after recovery; however, we are currently running tests with other subjects who have worn SCP‑15619 previously in order to determine if there is any correlation between wearing the object before and after recovery with these events occurring afterwards. Video Log Transcript #0156‑A: <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Okay… We're ready here… [Distant rustling] Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Can you hear me? Subject appears disoriented Subject appears disoriented Subject appears disoriented Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Are you able [subject coughs] can you hear me? Can you see anything unusual? Subject begins coughing more violently Dr ██████:: Is something wrong? Do you need help over there? [No response] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The subject did not respond during or after this event despite repeated attempts by researchers present during testing. The subject has since been terminated due to health complications resulting from prolonged exposure of his brain tissue via MRI scans performed during testing sessions; however, no abnormalities have been found within his brain tissue samples taken postmortem thus far except for minor traces of iron oxide particles located near portions of his temporal lobes which are believed to be remnants left over from previous experiments involving magnets conducted prior to Foundation custody taking place (See Experiment Logs 15608 through 15609).<br><br></div>
