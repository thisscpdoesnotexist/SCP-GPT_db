<div class='justifytext'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-14988</i> is  Unethical but useful to the Foundation</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-14988</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Thaumiel<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-14988</i> is to be stored on a computer system with no internet access and no ability to print, save, or otherwise copy any of its contents. The computer must be kept in a locked room with an armed guard at all times; this guard must not have read Document 14988 -244 .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14988</i> is a series of two hundred and forty-four (244) anomalous documents, collectively designated <i>SCP-14988</i>. <i>SCP-14988</i> is not a physical object; rather, it is an abstract concept that exists as a set of instructions for the creation and maintenance of other anomalous objects.<br><br><i>SCP-14988</i> was discovered in 19██, when Foundation researchers found an anomalous document in their archives that had been created by Dr. ██████ ██████████, who was believed to have died in 19██ during the [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further investigation revealed that this <i>"document"</i> was actually a set of instructions for creating another document which contained information on how to create yet another document; this process continued until 244 separate documents had been created. The final document contained instructions on how to create <i>SCP-14988</i> <br><br><b>itself: </b>specifically, it instructed readers to destroy all 243 other documents except for one copy each of Documents 14988 -1 through 14988 -243 , then transfer all remaining information from these 243 copies into one new file before deleting all 243 copies except for Document 14988 -244 . This final file contains no additional information about the nature or origin of <i>SCP-14988</i>; however, it has proven impossible to delete or otherwise dispose of any instances of Document 14988 -244 .<br><br>Once Document 14988 -244 has been created and read by a human being (referred hereafter as Subject), they will be compelled to use its contents as <br><br><b>directed: </b>namely, they must create and maintain 234 more documents similar in format and content to those described above (designated SCP-XXXX). Each instance must contain at least ten times as much text as its predecessor did; furthermore, each instance must be preceded by at least three instances containing less text than the previous instance did. Once this process has reached its ultimate conclusion with Document XXXX -2144 , Subject will begin creating instances containing increasingly large amounts of gibberish <br><br><b>instead: </b>these may include words from previously used languages but are mostly random strings with little or no grammatical structure whatsoever. Furthermore, once these gibberish instances have begun appearing they cannot be deleted without causing severe psychological trauma proportional in severity to the amount deleted—see Addendum XXXXA below for details on how this works.<br><br><h3>Addendum 14988.1 : </h3>!!!LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED!!!<br><br>Document 14988 -244 has been successfully deleted, and all other instances of Document 14988 -244 have been disposed of. However, the process described in the document continues to occur despite this. We are currently attempting to determine how this is possible and what we can do about it; however, we have made no progress so far. We have also discovered that several personnel who read Document 14988 -244 were not affected by it—however, none of these individuals remember reading it or know why they were unaffected by its effects. The current theory is that these individuals are immune to <i>SCP-14988</i>'s effects because their minds cannot comprehend <br><br><b>them: </b>if this is true then we may be able to use this immunity as a means of containing <i>SCP-14988</i> permanently. —Dr. ████████<br><br><h3>Addendum 14988.2 : </h3>Interview with !!!LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED!!!<br><br>The following interview was conducted on ██/██/████ between Dr. ████████ and Agent █████████, who was exposed to Document 14988 -244 but did not read it. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Please state your name for the record, Agent █████████. Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>[REDACTED], sir. <br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>Thank you, that will be all for now—we'll get back to you later if we have any more questions for you today…<br><br>[Agent █████████ leaves the room.]<br><br><b>Dr. ████████: </b>…I'm not sure what to make of this one… I mean, he's clearly immune to <i>SCP-14988</i>'s effects somehow—but how? And why? And why can't we use his immunity as a way of containing <i>SCP-14988</i>? This is just getting more confusing by the day… —Dr. ████████<br><br><h3>Addendum 14988.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment <br><br><b>XXXX-1: </b>Subject D-XXXX is a low-level Foundation researcher who has not read Document 14988 -244. He was given a copy of Document 14988 -244 and instructed to read it; after doing so, he was asked to create instances of SCP-XXXX as described in the document. Subject complied, creating instances XXXX -1 through XXXX -234 . After this process had progressed for approximately three months, Subject attempted to delete some gibberish text from an instance of SCP-XXXX; however, this caused him extreme psychological trauma and caused the instance in question (designated XXXX -235 ) to become corrupted beyond repair. As such, it has been deleted from all records and replaced with a new instance (designated XXXX -236 ).<br><br>Experiment Log: Experiment <br><br><b>XXXX-2: </b>Subject D-XXXX is another low level Foundation researcher who has not read Document 14988 -244. She was given a copy of Document 14988 -244 and instructed to read it; after doing so she was asked to create instances of SCP-XXXX as described in the document. Subject complied, creating instances XXXX -237 through 239 before becoming increasingly confused by its contents and refusing further cooperation with researchers—see Addendum below for details on how this came about. The remaining documents created by her are designated Instances 240 through 243 .<br><br></div>
