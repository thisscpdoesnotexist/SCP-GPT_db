<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-27542, colloquially referred to as "Clamantha," appears to be a humanoid entity resembling a female human with various aquatic features. Its skin maintains a pale, bioluminescent quality that enables it to glow faintly in dark environments. SCP-27542's hair seems to have properties akin to seaweed, and gills are located just below the ribcage, suggesting an aquatic adaptation. The entity can breathe both underwater and on the surface, although it prefers submerged environments.</p>
<p>The subject possesses the unique ability to communicate directly with, influence, and command sea life within a 500-meter radius. This control is hypothesized to be either telepathic or pheromone-based, but the exact mechanism remains undetermined. Additionally, SCP-27542 has shown considerable regenerative abilities, particularly when in contact with seawater.</p>
<p>SCP-27542 displays intelligence comparable to that of a human and exhibits a generally cooperative demeanor when interacting with Foundation personnel. However, it has expressed distress over containment and a strong desire to return to the ocean.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>SCP-27542 is contained within a large aquatic chamber at Site-██ that simulates a marine environment, with conditions regularly adjusted to mirror those of the North Atlantic Ocean. The chamber is to be monitored at all times by no fewer than two (2) Foundation personnel trained in aquatic containment protocols.</p>
<p>Staff assigned to SCP-27542 must undergo psychological evaluation to ensure no susceptibility to its influence. Interaction with SCP-27542 is to be conducted through a reinforced glass barrier. In the event of maintenance or medical examination, a minimum of two (2) armed guards are to be present due to its potential to manipulate marine life for defensive purposes.</p>
<p>In the context of its cooperative behavior, SCP-27542 is to be afforded three (3) hours of simulated natural daylight cycles, interactive enrichment activities, and a diet in accordance with its nutritional requirements, to minimize distress and ensure compliance.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>SCP-27542 was first encountered by fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, who reported sightings of a "mermaid commanding the sea." Media coverage triggered Foundation interest, and MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") were dispatched for investigation and retrieval, leading to the confirmation and containment of SCP-27542.</p>
<h3>Addendum 2: Initial Interview Log</h3>
<p>Interviewed: SCP-27542 "Clamantha."</p>
<p>Interviewer: Dr. Mira Singh, Marine Biologist and SCP-27542 Project Head.</p>
<p><The interview took place in a secure, water-filled chamber designed to accommodate SCP-27542's aquatic requirements. Communication was facilitated via a waterproof speaker system.></p>
<p>[Excerpt from the interview]</p>
<p>Dr. Singh: "Can you tell us where you come from?"</p>
<p>SCP-27542: "The depths, the womb of waves... where light fades and silence reigns."</p>
<p>Dr. Singh: "Do you remember how you came to be? Were you born this way, or were you once human?"</p>
<p>SCP-27542: "Born of salt and sorrow, I was touched by the abyss... Changed. I remember legs that walked on land, but now I flow with the tides."</p>
<p>(Note: The remainder of the interview focused on understanding SCP-27542's capabilities, needs, and desires. It expressed a longing for the ocean and a connection with "siblings of the sea.")</p>
<h3>Addendum 3: Experiment Log A - Communication Testing with Aquatic Species</h3>
<h4>Experiment 27542-A1</h4>
<p>Purpose: To verify SCP-27542's ability to communicate with and influence marine life.</p>
<p>Procedure: A single male Bluefin Tuna was introduced into SCP-27542's containment chamber.</p>
<p>Result: SCP-27542 made a series of clicking and whistling sounds, followed by the tuna responding with visible agitation. Subsequent commands led the fish to perform a series of complex maneuvers, suggesting an understanding and obedience unseen in the species' typical behavior.</p>
<h4>Experiment 27542-A2</h4>
<p>Purpose: To establish the range and limitations of SCP-27542's influence.</p>
<p>Procedure: Several different species of marine animals were introduced at varying distances from SCP-27542's location.</p>
<p>Result: Command efficacy diminished beyond a radius of approximately 500 meters. SCP-27542 appeared to have a more profound influence over cephalopods and elasmobranchs, potentially due to their more finely tuned nervous systems.</p>
<h3>Addendum 4: Incident Report I-27542-Alpha</h3>
<p>An unplanned containment breach occurred when a group of D-class personnel attempted an unauthorized entry into SCP-27542's chamber. SCP-27542 incited an aggressive response from the contained sea life, resulting in injuries to the intruders. The breach was contained without SCP-27542 leaving its chamber, highlighting the necessity of a strict adherence to containment protocols and personnel screening to prevent susceptibility.</p>
<h3>Addendum 5: UPDATE - Revised Containment Measures</h3>
<p>After Incident I-27542-Alpha, containment procedures have been updated to include biweekly assessments of SCP-27542's mental state by a Foundation-approved psychologist specializing in human-anomalies interactions to prevent future breaches from psychological distress.</p>
<h3>Addendum 6: Experiment Log B - Regenerative Properties</h3>
<h4>Experiment 27542-B1</h4>
<p>Purpose: To ascertain the extent and rate of SCP-27542's regenerative abilities.</p>
<p>Procedure: A superficial wound was inflicted on SCP-27542's forearm with its consent.</p>
<p>Result: The wound healed completely within six hours of continuous submersion in seawater.</p>
<h4>Experiment 27542-B2</h4>
<p>Purpose: To determine the effect of different water types on SCP-27542's regeneration.</p>
<p>Procedure: SCP-27542 subjected to similar wounds, subsequently submerged in fresh, brackish, and saltwater environments.</p>
<p>Result: Regeneration occurred in all instances, but was significantly slower in freshwater and brackish water compared to seawater.</p>
<h3>Addendum 7: Recovery Log</h3>
<p>MTF Gamma-6 provided a detailed account of SCP-27542's retrieval. The team encountered minimal resistance from local aquatic life, which had congregated around SCP-27542, seemingly in a protective formation. The use of specialized electromagnetic pulses temporarily disoriented the sea creatures, allowing for safe recovery.</p>
<h3>Addendum 8: General Information - Biological Analysis</h3>
<p>A comprehensive study of SCP-27542's physiology is ongoing. Early findings indicate an anatomy that, while broadly human, includes several piscine adaptations. The bioluminescence, gills, and skin texture suggest a deep-sea adaptation, yet SCP-27542 remains healthy under conditions found in shallower waters.</p>
<h3>Addendum 9: Interview Log B - Containment Dialogue</h3>
<p>Interviewed: SCP-27542 "Clamantha."</p>
<p>Interviewer: Dr. Mira Singh.</p>
<p><Following the breach incident and the enforcement of new containment procedures, dialogue was re-established to assess SCP-27542's adaptation to containment.></p>
<p>[Excerpt from the interview]</p>
<p>Dr. Singh: "How are you coping with the changes in your containment?"</p>
<p>SCP-27542: "The currents in this place are still. I fear that a still current is a dead sea. My song is silence, and my dance is stillness."</p>
<p>Dr. Singh: "Is there anything we can do to improve your well-being?"</p>
<p>SCP-27542: "Let me feel the ocean's pulse, even if only in dreams."</p>
<p>(Note: SCP-27542's cooperation has been linked to its psychological well-being. Recommendations include installation of a dynamic water flow system to simulate currents and occasional access to virtual reality projections mimicking the ocean.)</p>
<h3>Addendum 10: Miscellaneous - Potential Applications</h3>
<p>Potential applications of SCP-27542's abilities warrant ethical consideration. Proposals include utilizing SCP-27542's aquatic command for environmental research and deep-sea exploration. However, any such application would require careful balancing of the entity's human rights and its unique capabilities. This matter remains under review by the Ethics Committee.</p>
