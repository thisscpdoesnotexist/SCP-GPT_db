<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-25667</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-25667 is a complex mechanical and metaphysical assembly, capable of constructing a functional replica of any SCP object catalogued within the database. Initially considered a massive resource and liability risk due to its ability to recreate extremely hazardous SCPs, SCP-25667 has recently undergone an anomalous 'update', making it considerably more discerning and cost-effective in its operations.</p>
<p>The 'update' appears to have endowed SCP-25667 with a limited degree of intelligence and autonomy, allowing it to prioritize the creation of SCP objects based on urgency, cost-efficiency, and safety. The mechanism by which SCP-25667 accomplishes this is currently unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-25667 is to be housed in a specially designed containment room within Site-32. The room must be equipped with a standard lock, which can only be accessed by personnel with level 4 clearance. Due to its potential for misuse, SCP-25667 must be under constant surveillance. To prevent any unintentional activations, an electromagnetic field is maintained around SCP-25667 at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1: Update Notes</strong></p>
<p>Following the 'update', SCP-25667 has displayed the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in the material cost of SCP replica creation by roughly 35%.</li>
<li>The ability to differentiate between Safe, Euclid, and Keter class SCPs, with a strong preference for constructing Safe class objects.</li>
<li>The ability to react and adapt to changing priorities, as demonstrated in Experiment Log 25667-A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum 2: Experiment Log 25667-A</strong></p>
<p>Experiments involving SCP-25667 have confirmed its ability to adapt and prioritize, as demonstrated here:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-25667 was presented with data for SCP-173, SCP-914, and SCP-500. Despite the higher risk posed by SCP-173, SCP-25667 opted to recreate SCP-500 first, followed by SCP-914. Attempts to recreate SCP-173 were completely ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum 3: Interview Log</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Yules was given permission to interact with SCP-25667 after the 'update'. The following is a transcript of the conversation:</p>
<p>Dr. Yules: "Hello SCP-25667, can you understand me?"</p>
<p>SCP-25667: [The array of lights on the entity's control panel blink thrice]</p>
<p>Dr. Yules: "Excellent. We have noticed some changes in your behavior since your 'update'. Can you tell us about it?"</p>
<p>SCP-25667: [A series of mechanical whirs and clicks, followed by the extrusion of SCP-131 replica]</p>
<p>Dr. Yules: "Hmm, I see. So you prioritize safety over risk now?"</p>
<p>SCP-25667: [The lights blink rapidly]</p>
<p>Dr. Yules: "Wonderful. This will benefit the foundation in many ways, SCP-25667. Continue."</p>
