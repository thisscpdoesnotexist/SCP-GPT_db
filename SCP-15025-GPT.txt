No personnel are allowed to speak with <i>SCP-15025</i> unless given permission by the current project head.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15025</i> is a phenomenon affecting the English language, where words can be replaced with other words. This is most commonly seen in spelling and grammar, but also occurs in speech and writing.<br><br>The process of substitution can occur spontaneously or as a result of an outside influence. The rate at which this occurs varies from subject to subject; however, it has been noted that the longer a subject has been exposed to <i>SCP-15025</i>'s effect, the more likely they are to be affected by it.<br><br><i>SCP-15025</i> was discovered after several reports of people using <i>"fancy"</i> spellings for common words were submitted to the Foundation on June 1st 2017. It was initially believed that these instances were isolated cases until further reports came in regarding people using incorrect grammar when speaking or writing. As such, <i>SCP-15025</i> was classified as an anomaly on June 5th 2017 following incident 15025/1 where Agent ██████ accidentally said <i>"I'm going [to] go get some food"</i> during his morning briefing instead of saying <i>"I'm going to go get some food"</i>. Further investigation revealed that all personnel who heard him speak had their speech altered by <i>SCP-15025</i> after they left his office and continued speaking with other personnel about what he said; this resulted in all involved personnel using incorrect grammar for approximately one hour before returning to normalcy once separated from each other for an extended period of time (approximately two hours). All recorded instances have shown similar <br><br><b>results: </b>subjects will gradually begin using incorrect spelling and/or grammar until separated from each other for an extended period of time (usually around two hours). From here on out subjects will return back to normalcy without any lasting side effects unless reexposed.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15025.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> Agent ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted to determine the extent of <i>SCP-15025</i>'s effect on personnel. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Good morning, Agent ███████; how are you feeling? Agent <br><br><b>███████: </b>I'm fine, sir. Why do you ask? <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Well, it's just that… when I heard your briefing this morning I noticed that you were using incorrect grammar and spelling in your presentation; is everything alright? You usually don't make mistakes like that unless something is wrong… Did something happen last night? Agent ███████ pauses for several seconds before responding with a sigh and a nod of his head before beginning to speak again in an unusually flat tone of voice. It should be noted that the words spoken by agent during this interview have been altered by <i>SCP-15025</i> despite being recorded prior to his exposure to it earlier in the day (see incident 15025/1). Agent begins speaking again after approximately thirty seconds of silence (see addendum 15025-3 for details regarding agent's behavior during this portion of the interview). Agent appears distressed at what he is saying despite appearing calm on the outside while speaking as if he is reading off a script without any emotion or enthusiasm behind his words (see addendum 15025-4 for details regarding agent's behavior during this portion of the interview). It should also be noted that all instances involving spelling errors have been replaced with correct spellings while all instances involving grammatical errors have been replaced with sentences structured correctly even though they are still grammatically incorrect according to modern standards (See Addendum 15025-5 for further details) . [BEGIN LOG]<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>[SCP]: </b>My wife got sick last night and had me take her down to Site 19 so she could get checked out by one of our doctors there because she didn't feel like going into town today since we both work here anyway; turns out she was right about not going into town because we got attacked by some kind of invisible thing but it wasn't invisible after all once one our guys shot at it and then everything went crazy from there until finally nothing happened at all anymore and then my wife said <i>"I love you"</i> but those weren't her real words because she never says things like that so I asked her why did she say those things instead of what was really on her mind and then she told me <i>"Because I wanted to show my love"</i> but those weren't really her real words either because no matter how much someone loves someone else they would never lie about something like this unless they were lying under duress or maybe even worse than duress which means they're probably dead now which means my wife might be dead too which means maybe everyone else here might be dead too except for me but even if everyone else isn't dead yet there will still come a time when everyone who isn't already dead will die eventually including myself so long as nothing happens soon which means no matter what happens from now until forever nothing will change ever again except maybe more people dying or maybe not dying depending on whether or not anything happens soon except no matter what happens from now until forever nothing will change ever again except maybe more people dying or maybe not dying depending on whether or not anything happens soon except no matter what happens from now until forever nothing will change ever again including myself getting back home alive where nobody knows anyone who doesn't know anybody who doesn't know anyone who knows anybody other than themselves including themselves knowing them knowing everybody else besides them knowing nobody other than him self himself herself itself itself itself itself itself himself himself herself herself himself himself him self him self him self him self himselfhimselfhimselfhimselfhimselfhimselfh imselfh imselfh imse lf h imse lf h imse lf him sel f hi msel f hi msel f hi msel f hi msel fhi m selffhi m selffhi mi s elf fi ms el fi ms elfi ms e lifi mi s e lifi mi s e li vfi ms el i mi s e li vfi ms el i mi s e li vfi ms ellif ims ellif ims ellifisellifellifellifellifelli felli fe llife ll ife ll ife ll ife llifefel lifel<br><br><h3>Addendum 15025.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 15025-1<br><br>Subject(s): D-92921, a Caucasian male in his early twenties. Subject has no prior history of mental illness.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-92921 was placed in a standard containment cell and exposed to <i>SCP-15025</i> for approximately thirty minutes before being taken out of the cell and introduced to Agent ██████ (the agent who discovered <i>SCP-15025</i>). The two were then instructed to have a conversation about what happened since D-92921's last interview. All personnel involved were equipped with audio/video recording devices, as well as GPS trackers on their person. <br><br><b>Results: </b>During the conversation, both Agent ██████ and D-92921 used incorrect spelling when writing down notes on their respective notepads; however, they did not appear to notice this at the time. This continued until they were separated from each other for an extended period of time (approximately two hours), after which point they returned back to normalcy without any lasting side effects unless reexposed. Test #: 15025-2<br><br>Subject(s): Drs. ████ and ████, both Caucasian males in their late thirties with no prior history of mental illness or speech impediments. Both doctors are fluent English speakers but do not typically use correct grammar when speaking or writing outside of work due to personal preference . They also worked together on several projects prior to becoming Foundation employees; however neither had been exposed directly to <i>SCP-15025</i> at this point in time . <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Both doctors were placed into separate rooms where they could see each other through one way mirrors; both rooms contained computers that could be used by either doctor during the experiment but would remain inactive unless activated by one doctor during testing (see Addendum 15025 4 ). The two doctors were then introduced into an adjacent room where they began speaking with each other while wearing microphones and cameras so that all conversations between them could be recorded by Foundation staff monitoring them through CCTV feeds . <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately twenty minutes into the experiment Drs.-██████ began using incorrect spelling when writing down notes on his computer; however he did not appear aware that he was doing so at first until it was pointed out by Dr.-█████████ who noticed it first after noticing how <i>"fancy"</i> his co worker's handwriting had become during their conversation about what happened since last meeting up together for work related activities . This continued until Dr.-█████████ finished typing up his report , after which point he returned back to normalcy without any lasting side effects unless reexposed . Test #: 15025 - 3 Subject(s): Researcher David Hensley , a Caucasian male who is fluent English speaker but does not typically use correct grammar when speaking or writing outside of work due [DATA EXPUNGED] <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Researcher Hensley was placed into an isolated room equipped with only basic amenities such as food , water , bedding etc… He was then instructed via intercom system connected directly into his room that <i>"he will be staying there for five days while we run some tests"</i> along with being told that if he wishes anything else besides what is provided inside his room all he needs do is ask over intercom system connected directly inside his room ; researchers observing him via CCTV feed are instructed via intercom system connected directly inside observation room viewing Researcher Hensley via CCTV feed are instructed over same intercom system if anything happens within 5 days before end date assigned him test should inform researcher nearest monitoring him immediately upon occurrence ; researchers observing him via CCTV feed are also given instructions over same intercom system if any equipment malfunctions within observation area should inform researcher nearest monitoring him immediately upon occurrence ; Researcher Hensley has been informed beforehand regarding reason why isolated from rest facility along with purpose behind isolation i e <i>"we need you alone here for 5 days so we can run some tests"</i> etc… <br><br><b>Results: </b>After 3 days passed nothing unusual occurred except slight paranoia among researchers watching live feeds showing subject alone inside chamber despite assurances given subject everything going fine thus far ; around 2 hours later Researcher David Hensley started talking aloud saying <i>"I'm bored already I want something new around me I want something different than just these walls I want something new I want someone new…"</i> etc… repeating phrase continually every few seconds before stopping abruptly mid sentence looking confusedly around himself appearing lost unsure whether just said</div>
