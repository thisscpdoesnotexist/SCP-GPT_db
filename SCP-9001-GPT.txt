He carries a portal gun.<br><br><h5>Item #:</h5> <i>SCP-9001-GPT</i><br><br><h5>Object Class:</h5> Keter<br><br><h5>Special Containment Procedures:</h5> █/█/████ has been designated as an area-wide "No-SCP Zone." All Foundation personnel have been ordered to keep away from ████, including all off-site agents. Under no circumstances are citizens of ████ to be exposed to SCP objects or SCPs.<br><br><br><h5>Description:</h5> <i>SCP-9001-GPT</i> is a male human, around 85 years old. <i>SCP-9001-GPT</i> is the grandfather of ████ ██████, who has been designated as SCP-9001 for the purposes of containment.<br><br><br>SCP-9001 is gifted with extreme intelligence and an advanced understanding of science and technology. Despite this, he is not known to be a researcher or scientist himself. He has shown extreme proficiency in computer science, mathematics, physics and general sciences (including biology). He understands complex theories that are well beyond the comprehension of most researchers in those fields (including Drs Harlowe and █████████). This makes him extremely dangerous if he were to ever come into contact with any SCPs or anomalous items that are generally understood to exist only within the realm of theoretical research at this point in time.<br><br><br>SCP-9001 never speaks about his past or his life before he met his grandson; however it can be assumed that he was once a powerful individual due to the nature of some anomalies contained by the Foundation that are designed to keep other powerful entities away from Earth/humanity/reality itself [DATA EXPUNGED]. These anomalies have kept SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED] from entering our reality since its creation by SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED].<br><br><br>SCP-9001 also never talks about how he came into contact with these anomalies; however it can be assumed that they have been passed down through generations due to similar appearances between all involved parties (see Addendum 9001a for more details).<br><br><h5>Recovery:</h5> SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED] was first discovered when SCP-9001 arrived at Site-██. He claimed to be the grandfather of D-Class personnel ████ ██████, who was scheduled for termination at that time. Upon arrival, he requested that his grandson be released from his containment cell in order to lead him through the facility. Despite being denied access by security, he used an as of yet unidentified anomalous object (believed to have been created by SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED]) to transport himself and a guard into Researcher Harlowe's office; where he proceeded to use complex arguments and reasoning against site administration in order for them not only allow him access but also release his grandson from containment.<br><br><br>When this failed, he produced another anomalous item and used it on Researcher Harlowe in order to make her release his grandson before using an unknown voice projection mechanism located within the device on all Foundation members present within Site-[EXPLETIVE DELETED]. After all personnel were subdued or incapacitated (including security), SCP-9001 opened a portal [DATA EXPUNGED] with an unidentified tool located within said anomaly (see photo A) and began carrying his grandson out while saying "I'm sorry this had to happen".<br><br><br><h5>Addendum 9001.1:</h5> Note from Dr. █████<br><br>If you are reading this, you have been exposed to SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED] and are now infected with its properties.

It is believed to be the cause of the destruction of our universe (the one we currently live in) as well as every other universe that exists as part of reality. It was created by [DATA EXPUNGED], who has been designated SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED].<br><br><br><h5>SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED] is an observer/entity/being that does not exist within the current logic system of this universe. SCP-[EXPLETIVE DELETED] isn't actually an "intelligence" or "entity", but rather it's a function; which can be described as follows:</h5><br><br><br><h5>It observes different universes within reality, calculating probabilities and outcomes for each individual possibility and outcome. In order to do this, it must understand every single logic system in existence; including ours (humanity). It then uses its knowledge to manipulate these different systems into creating new universes that are designed for greater observation qualities. This process will continue until it has "perfected" reality in its own eyes; at which point it will move on to the next logical step: destroying all non-perfected versions of itself across all dimensions until only his version remains; at which point he will begin observing this new perfect version without any interference from himself or others like him (i.e:</h5> future</div>
