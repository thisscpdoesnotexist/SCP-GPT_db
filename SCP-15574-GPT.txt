Upon discovery, <i>SCP-15574</i> was found to be fully functional and contained one standard sized staple cartridge.<br><br><i>SCP-15574</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is used on any piece of paper or cardboard with writing on it. When used in this manner, <i>SCP-15574</i> will duplicate all text written on the original material onto its own surface (See Addendum). The duplicated text will then be read aloud by an unidentified voice that has been described as <i>"smooth"</i> and <i>"deep"</i>, regardless if there are any living entities within earshot of <i>SCP-15574</i>. This effect occurs even when <i>SCP-15574</i> is not being used to staple materials together.<br><br><i>SCP-15564</i>'s anomalous properties do not seem to occur if there are no living entities within earshot of it for some time after its effects have occurred (See Addendum). However, once this time period has passed without a living entity hearing the reading aloud from <i>SCP-15564</i>'s effects, said entity will experience extreme feelings of dread until they hear another reading from its effects again (See Addendum). The exact length that this time period lasts seems to vary between individuals but generally ranges between several hours and several days after initial exposure to instances produced by 155744 before symptoms begin manifesting in affected individuals (See Addendum). Once these symptoms have manifested in an individual they can only be reversed by hearing another instance produced by 155744 again or experiencing death . Once an individual has experienced these symptoms once , they become immune to them for life . Individuals who have been exposed multiple times report feeling more intense dread upon experiencing repeated exposures compared with their first exposure . In addition , subjects exposed multiple times also report feeling less inclined towards violence against themselves when presented with situations where such actions would result in them hearing another instance produced by 155744 again . It should be noted that subjects who have been exposed multiple times also appear more resistant towards memetic agents than those who were only exposed once . Upon death , affected individuals exhibit signs similar to those associated with clinical depression including but not limited too: loss of appetite , insomnia , suicidal ideation and self harm/ mutilation . These signs typically last for about two weeks before disappearing completely ; however some cases show no signs at all while others show<br><br><h3>Addendum 15574.1 : </h3>  <br><br>The following is a sample of text that was used in testing with <i>SCP-15574</i>:<br><br><i>SCP-15574</i> Test Log Test #: 1 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-9341, a 32 year old Caucasian male. <br><br><b>Result: </b>The writing on the paper turned black and began to move around the page , forming into words . A voice then began to speak these words aloud , reading them as they were written . D-9341 became visibly distressed at this point and attempted to tear up the paper but was unable to do so. After about 2 minutes of reading aloud from <i>SCP-15574</i>'s effects , D - 9341 fell unconscious due to psychological trauma . <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that SCP - 15574's effects only occur when living beings are present within earshot of it while its effects are being read aloud. Test #: 2 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>D - 9342, a 34 year old Hispanic female. <br><br><b>Result: </b>The writing on the paper turned black and began to move around the page , forming into words . A voice then began to speak these words aloud , reading them as they were written . At this point, several armed guards entered the room and restrained D - 9342 before she could tear up or otherwise damage any part of SCP - 15574 or its test material. <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that once an instance produced by 155744 has been heard by a living entity, said entity will feel compelled towards self harm until another instance is produced by 155744 again or until death occurs from psychological trauma caused by repeated exposure (See Addendum). This compulsion does not seem affected by memetic agents (See Addendum) but does appear affected by amnestics (See Addendum). Amnestics appear effective at reversing all symptoms associated with repeated exposure including immunity towards future exposures for life ; however it should be noted that all cases show signs similar those associated with clinical depression for about two weeks after treatment before disappearing completely . In addition, there have been no recorded cases where individuals exposed multiple times have committed suicide after recovery from their symptoms unlike those who were only exposed once; however there have been reports where individuals who had recovered from repeated exposures were more prone towards violence against themselves than those who had only experienced one exposure when presented with situations where such actions would result in them hearing another instance produced by 155744 again. Test #: 3 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>Dr ██████ ████████ <br><br><b>Result: </b>Dr ██████ immediately tore up his own papers upon being handed them without any apparent distress or hesitation in his movements whatsoever; he did not react negatively when informed afterwards that he had destroyed samples containing information regarding his family members' health conditions despite having previously requested permission for him not be given access to this information due to personal reasons unrelated t o Foundation operations. <br><br><b>Analysis: </b>While we now know how instances produced b y 15564 affect humans, we still do not know why such an effect occurs nor why some people are more resistant than others against such an effect occurring in general let alone multiple times ; further testing is required in order t o ascertain if there are any other factors involved here aside from just distance between subjects and instances produced b y 15564 during its active phase as well as what exactly causes subjects exposed multiple times t o exhibit signs similar t o clinical depression after recovering instead of committing suicide like those who have only experienced one exposure do; also what exactly causes subjects exposed multiple times t o become immune f rom future exposures for life compared w ith those who experience just one exposur e remains unknown at present time along w ith whether or n ot said immunity extends beyond clinical depression related issues alone .<br><br></div>
