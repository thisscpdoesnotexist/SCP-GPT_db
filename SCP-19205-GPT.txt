The proof consists of a series of equations and logical statements which, when taken together, demonstrate that 1 cannot be mathematically defined or expressed in any form.<br><br>The proof was discovered by Dr. ██████ on ██/██/20██ during an investigation into the implications of certain theories concerning the nature of mathematics and reality. It has been determined that if the conclusions drawn from <i>SCP-19205</i> are accepted as true, then all known mathematical systems would become invalidated and rendered useless for practical purposes.<br><br>Furthermore, it is believed that accepting this conclusion could potentially destabilize reality itself due to its implications on how we perceive our universe to function. As such, containment procedures have been put in place to prevent knowledge or understanding of <i>SCP-19205</i> from reaching the public at large.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-19205</i> is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-██. Access to the proof is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher, and must be approved by the Site Director.<br><br>Any attempts to replicate or verify <i>SCP-19205</i>'s conclusions are strictly prohibited, and any personnel found attempting such activities will be reprimanded accordingly. In addition, all research related to <i>SCP-19205</i> must be conducted under strict supervision from a senior researcher assigned by the Site Director.<br><br><br><h3> Addendum 19205.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, an individual claiming to be the author of <i>SCP-19205</i> contacted Site-██ and requested access to the proof. The individual was identified as Dr. ██████, a former researcher at Site-██ who had gone missing several months prior.<br><br>Dr. ██████ was detained and questioned regarding his involvement with <i>SCP-19205</i>, but no useful information was obtained from him before he committed suicide in his cell shortly afterwards.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19205.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ██████<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Dr. ████, can you tell us how you discovered <i>SCP-19205</i>?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> It was a combination of luck and intuition, really. I had been exploring certain theories about the nature of mathematics for some time and was attempting to find a way to prove them when I stumbled upon this proof. It just seemed so obvious that it couldn't be true…but then again, it was too perfect not to be true. So I decided to investigate further.<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> And what did you find?<br><b><br>Dr. ██████:</b> Well, after a lot of hard work and research, I was able to prove that the number 1 does not exist. It's an incredibly powerful concept and one that could have far-reaching implications if it were ever made public. That's why I contacted the Foundation right away so they could take steps to contain it before anyone else found out about it.<br><br><h3> Addendum 19205.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>██/██/20██ - Dr. ██████ and a team of researchers have begun attempting to replicate the conclusions drawn from <i>SCP-19205</i>. After several days of experimentation, it was determined that the proof is valid and accurate, though attempts to verify its accuracy have been unsuccessful thus far.</div>
