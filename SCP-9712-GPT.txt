This phenomenon occurs when two gay people look at each other, and then look up into the sky.<br><br><i>SCP-9712</i> was discovered by Dr. Clef in 2009, after he saw a double rainbow while walking down the street with his boyfriend. After further research, it was discovered that this phenomenon occurs every time two gay people fall in love with each other. It has been determined that <i>SCP-9712</i> will not occur if one of the individuals is not homosexual or if they are looking at something besides each other (e.g., looking at their phone).<br><br><h3>Addendum 9712.1 : </h3><br><br><h3>Addendum 9712.2 : </h3>Interview with <br><br><h3>Addendum 9712.3 : </h3>Experiment Log :<br><br>Experiment 9712-1:<br><br><b>Subjects: </b>D-9712-01 and D-9712-02<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-9712-01 and D-9712-02 were to look at each other for five minutes, then look up into the sky. The two subjects were then separated by a one meter distance. After this, they were instructed to look back at each other. Both subjects complied with the instructions.<br><br><b>Results: </b><i>SCP-9712</i> did not occur when the two individuals looked back at each other after being separated by one meter distance from each other. The experiment was repeated with another subject pair, but this time they were told to hold hands while looking up into the sky (after being instructed to separate). This resulted in SCP 9712 occurring again. It should be noted that if both individuals are holding hands while looking up into the sky, SCP 9712 will not occur unless they are within three meters of their partner's face (or equivalent). This is because both individuals must be able to see their partner's eyes in order for them to fall in love with each other . Experiment Log :</div>
