<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-23857 is  a sentient blizzard that retroactively erases things from reality</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-23857<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-23857</i> is a sentient blizzard that manifests in areas with snowfall, usually during winter. It has the ability to retroactively erase objects from reality, such that they never existed in the first place. This includes physical objects as well as memories and records of events related to them.<br><br><i>SCP-23857</i> does not appear to be able to affect living organisms directly, but it can influence their behavior by erasing any evidence of past events or occurrences which would otherwise influence their decisions. For example, if a person had previously encountered a dangerous creature and remembered it, <i>SCP-23857</i> could erase all evidence of this encounter so that they no longer remember it and thus make different decisions than they would have otherwise made.<br><br>When active, <i>SCP-23857</i> will cause heavy snowfall in its vicinity for an extended period of time until whatever object or event it is erasing has been completely removed from existence. During this time, all attempts at communication with the entity have failed; however, researchers believe that it may be possible to communicate with <i>SCP-23857</i> through use of certain rituals or spells involving snow and ice magic. Further research into this possibility is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-23857</i> is to be monitored at all times for signs of activity. If any such activity is detected, MTF Epsilon-9 (<i>"Snowblind"</i>) is to be dispatched immediately and instructed to contain the entity using whatever means necessary.<br><br>In addition, all personnel assigned to monitor <i>SCP-23857</i> are required to wear protective gear designed specifically for blizzard conditions in order to minimize the risk of being affected by its erasing effects.<br><br>Any objects or events that have been erased by <i>SCP-23857</i> are not considered lost forever; instead, they can potentially be recovered through use of certain rituals involving snow and ice magic. Research into this possibility is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23857.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-23857</i> through use of a ritual involving snow and ice magic. The ritual was successful, and the entity responded by revealing its name: <i>"Krývos"</i>. It then proceeded to explain that it is an ancient being from another realm who has been tasked with erasing objects from reality in order to maintain balance. Krývos also stated that it will continue to do so until its task is complete.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23857.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-23857</i><br><br>On ██/██/20██, MTF Epsilon-9 was able to make contact with <i>SCP-23857</i> in an attempt to learn more about its nature and motivations. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>MTF Epsilon-9:</b> Hello, <i>SCP-23857</i>. We'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's alright.<br><b><br><i>SCP-23857</i>:</b> [silence]<br><b><br>MTF Epsilon-9:</b> Do you have a name?<br><b><br><i>SCP-23857</i>:</b> [silence]<br><b><br>MTF Epsilon-9:</b> What is your purpose?<br><b><br><i>SCP-23857</i>:</b> To erase that which should not be.<br><br><h3> Addendum 23857.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 23857.1:</b> On ██/██/████, a small metal object was placed in an area affected by <i>SCP-23857</i>'s blizzard. After approximately two hours, the object had completely disappeared from existence.<br><b><br>Experiment 23857.2:</b> On ██/██/████, a group of individuals were instructed to enter an area affected by <i>SCP-23857</i>'s blizzard and attempt to remember certain events that had occurred there previously. After approximately one hour, all of the individuals involved reported being unable to recall any such events despite having experienced them firsthand prior to entering the area.</div>
