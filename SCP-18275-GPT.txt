The signal is composed of a series of numbers, spoken in a sensual female voice. The transmission repeats every hour on the hour and consists of three sets of five digits each, followed by one set of four digits.<br><br>The origin and purpose of <i>SCP-18275</i> are currently unknown. Attempts to trace the signal have been unsuccessful, as it appears to be transmitted from multiple locations simultaneously. All attempts to decipher any meaning or purpose behind the numbers have also failed thus far.<br><br>The only known effect caused by <i>SCP-18275</i> is an overwhelming sensation of sexual arousal in all individuals within range (approximately 15 kilometers) when listening to the transmission for more than 10 minutes at a time. This effect does not appear to be related to any particular individual or group; anyone exposed will experience it regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> Due to the nature of <i>SCP-18275</i>, containment is impossible. All personnel are to be warned against listening to the transmission for extended periods of time. Any personnel found in violation of this directive will be subject to disciplinary action.<br><br>Research into possible methods of neutralizing or containing <i>SCP-18275</i> is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18275.1: </h3> On ██/██/████, a series of numbers were broadcast in the same manner as <i>SCP-18275</i>. However, these numbers were accompanied by an additional message: <i>"The key to your desires lies within."</i> Analysis is ongoing.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18275.2: </h3> Interview with Dr. ████<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> So, what do you think this thing is?<br><b><br>Researcher █████:</b> Well, it's obviously some kind of broadcast meant to elicit a sexual response in its listeners. We don't know who or what is behind it though, or why they're doing it. It could be anything from a prank to something more sinister.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Do you think it's dangerous?<br><b><br>Researcher █████:</b> I'm not sure. On the one hand, it could be a harmless prank, but on the other hand, if someone was using this to manipulate people for some kind of gain…well, that could be very dangerous indeed. We just don't know enough about it yet.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18275.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████<br><b>Subject:</b> D-18275-1<br><b>Procedure:</b> D-18275-1 was instructed to listen to <i>SCP-18275</i> for an hour.<br><b>Results:</b> After approximately 10 minutes, the subject began displaying signs of arousal, including increased heart rate and heavy breathing. The subject continued to display these symptoms until the end of the experiment.</div>
