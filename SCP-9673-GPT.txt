My name is Dr. ██████, and I'm here to ask you some questions about your grandson and the portal gun you carry around with you. Is that okay?<br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9673</i>:</b> Sure! Ask away! I love talking about my grandson! He's so smart for a kid his age! He's only 5 years old but he knows how to use the portal gun better than me sometimes!<br><br><br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> That's great to hear, but let's get back on topic please… So how did your grandson get into this dimension?<br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9673</i>:</b> Well it all started when we were in our house one day… Suddenly there was a flash of light and then my wife was gone… My son was crying because he thought she had left him forever… Then suddenly there was another flash of light and my wife appeared again! She said that she had been kidnapped by an evil scientist who wanted her brain for his experiments… So I went through the portal gun after her and saved her from him before he could do anything bad to her brain or anything like that... Then we came back home safe with nothing bad happening at all... It really made me feel good knowing that I saved my family from danger like that… That night we all slept together in our bed as a family again... It felt so nice knowing they were both safe with me watching over them while they slept peacefully... The next day when we woke up, my wife told me something very interesting though... She said she saw another world through the portal gun while she was being held captive by the evil scientist guy.. She said it looked just like ours except everything seemed more peaceful than ours does.. And then she told me about how there were people living in this other world who used portals instead of cars or planes to travel between cities.. They would just walk into a building called <i>"The Portal Building"</i> which would take them anywhere they wanted in no time at all.. And then they would walk out of another building called <i>"The Portal Building"</i> which would take them anywhere else they wanted just as fast as their first trip took them.. That way nobody ever has to wait long for anything ever again because everything is always right where you need it whenever you need it most without wasting any time getting there at all.... It sounded so amazing!! Like something out of an adventure movie or something!! But anyway after hearing what happened I decided to go on an adventure myself using the portal gun too see if what she saw really existed somewhere else besides here.... So one day when my son wasn't looking I went through the portal gun into this other dimension where everything seems more peaceful than ours does.... When i got there though i couldn't find anyone around who could help me find out where exactly in this new dimension i needed to go next..... But luckily i found someone named <i>"Agent Smith"</i> who helped guide me towards finding what i needed...... We walked around together until finally Agent Smith pointed towards something far away saying <i>"That must be it!"</i>...... So i looked over towards where Agent Smith pointed hoping he knew what he was talking about..... And sure enough standing right before us stood a giant building made completely out of glass....... Inside stood many people walking around doing whatever business people do inside buildings made completely out of glass....... They didn't seem too interested in us since Agent Smith and myself weren't wearing suits or ties like everyone else inside did...... After walking inside Agent smith asked one man if anyone knew where exactly room #4B2C4D3E6F7G8H1I2J3K4L5M6N7O8P9Q0R1S2T3U4V5W6X7Y8Z 9A0B1C2D3E6F7G8H1I2J3K4L5M6N7O8P9Q0R1S2T3U4V5W6X7Y8Z 9A0B1C2D3E6F7G8H1I2J3K4L5M6N7O8P9Q0R 1S 2T 3U 4V 5W 6X 7Y 8Z</div>
