    <center> <h3> SCP-25706 is  The beach that makes you old </h3> </center>
    <h3>Item #:</h3>
<p>SCP-25706</p>
<h3>Object Class:</h3>
<p>Euclid</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>SCP-25706 is a geographical anomaly located on an undisclosed stretch of beach approximately 3 kilometers in length, situated along the coastline of [REDACTED]. The anomalous property of SCP-25706 manifests when a human subject enters a demarcated zone on the sands, estimated to be 1.5 kilometers in diameter. Upon entering this "aging zone", subjects experience rapid aging at a rate approximately one year per hour spent within the area. This effect does not appear to be psychological, as physiological changes consistent with natural aging occur, including but not limited to graying hair, loss of skin elasticity, decreased muscle mass, and deterioration of cognitive functions.</p>
<p>The anomaly does not affect inanimate objects or non-human life forms. Furthermore, the rate of aging returns to normal upon exiting the affected zone. However, the effects of aging endured while within the perimeter appear to be irreversible. SCP-25706 does not appear to cause other temporal anomalies or distortions outside of its defined area.</p>
<h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
<p>Access to SCP-25706 is strictly prohibited to unauthorized personnel. The perimeter has been secured under the guise of a protected ecological reserve, with Foundation personnel posing as park rangers to deter civilians. Electromagnetic barriers have been erected around the anomaly's zone of influence to prevent accidental entry.</p>
<p>To minimize suspicion from the local population and visitors, misinformation campaigns have been employed, attributing the lack of access to hazardous environmental conditions or governmental conservation efforts. All trails leading to SCP-25706 are monitored, and any individuals who manage to bypass initial security measures are to be intercepted, administered Class-A amnestics, and released at a safe distance from the anomaly.</p>
<p>Researchers studying SCP-25706 are advised to work in 30-minute shifts to limit exposure to the aging effect. Personnel are to undergo thorough medical evaluation before and after each shift.</p>
<h3>Addendum 1:</h3>
<p><strong>Interview Log 25706-01</strong></p>
<p><em>Interviewer: Dr. Marcus Lindell</em></p>
<p><em>Subject: Mr. [REDACTED], a local fisherman who reportedly encountered SCP-25706</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindell:</strong> Good afternoon. Can you recount your experience on the day you discovered the anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Sure. It was just another day at the beach for me. I was looking for a good spot to set up, and I stumbled upon this area where everything seemed... different. The air was kinda heavy, and the sand, it sorta pulled at my feet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindell:</strong> And did you notice any immediate effects?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Yeah, I felt tired all of a sudden. More tired than I shouldâ€™ve. I thought I was just worn out from the week. But when I looked in the mirror that night, I saw it. My hair, it was grayer than before. And my face... I swear, I looked ten years older.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindell:</strong> Can you estimate how long you spent within the area?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. [REDACTED]:</strong> Couple of hours, maybe? Hard to say. I lost track of time there.</p>
<p><em>[Interview continues with Mr. [REDACTED] describing his subsequent health issues and panic upon realizing the permanence of his condition. Dr. Lindell assures him that his experiences are under investigation and extends the Foundation's healthcare services to Mr. [REDACTED].]</em></p>
<h3>Addendum 2:</h3>
<p><strong>Experiment Log 25706-03</strong></p>
<p><em>Experiment Aims: To ascertain the precise rate of aging within SCP-25706's area of effect and determine if there are any variations at different locations within the zone.</em></p>
<p><em>Researchers: Dr. Emily Cho, Dr. Arjun Patel</em></p>
<p><em>Procedure: A D-Class personnel was equipped with a lifelogging camera and a digital watch synchronized to an external timekeeping device.</em></p>
<p><em>Results: The D-Class subject aged approximately 12 years over the course of a 12-hour period, confirming the initial rate of aging reported. A noticeable acceleration in the aging process was not observed in different zones. Subject exhibited significant cognitive decline upon retrieval and was ultimately rendered incapacitated.</em></p>
<p><em>Conclusion: The aging effect of SCP-25706 remains consistent throughout its area of influence, with no recorded variances based on position within the zone.</em></p>
<h3>Addendum 3:</h3>
<p>Further exploration and long-term observation of the SCP-25706 anomaly have been proposed and are pending O5 approval. Current research suggests the possibility of latency or delayed secondary effects outside the initial aging acceleration, necessitating ongoing study. All data collected thus far points to SCP-25706 as a localized spatial-temporal phenomenon with a singular, uniformly distributed effect. Analysis of soil, air, and water samples from the affected area has yet to reveal any discernible catalyst or source for the anomaly. The recommendation for upgrading the object class to Keter has been denied at this time due to the containment feasibility under the current Euclid protocols.</p></div>
