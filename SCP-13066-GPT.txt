It is to be fed one whole bucket of KFC chicken every day, and any requests for other foods are to be denied. Any personnel entering <i>SCP-13066</i>'s containment cell must wear full body armor and carry a high-powered rifle or shotgun with them at all times; however, they must not fire unless ordered by a Level 4 researcher or higher.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-13066</i> is a sentient bucket of KFC chicken, with muscular hairy limbs sprouting out of the bucket.<br><br><i>SCP-13066</i> was created by an unknown entity. <i>SCP-13066</i> was found in a field during an investigation into reports of a <i>"KFC Chicken Monster"</i>, after several reports were made about it eating people in the area. When agents arrived on the scene, <i>SCP-13066</i> engaged them and killed two before being subdued by gunfire. It has been contained since then, and is currently being held at Site ██ pending further research into its origins and abilities.<br><br><i>SCP-13066</i>'s body consists entirely of KFC chicken meat, with no traces of bones or skin present anywhere on its body; however, it does still possess human facial features such as eyes and lips (albeit not functional). Its legs are muscular and hairy like those of humans; however they have been fused to its torso via unknown means. The inside of <i>SCP-13066</i>'s mouth contains numerous sharp teeth that can easily tear through flesh or bone when used in combat; this may be one possible way it consumes prey items if it cannot obtain any at other times (see Addendum <br><br><b>13066: </b>Testing Logs). It also possesses two long claws that protrude from each hand which can be used for slashing attacks or digging through solid objects such as walls or floors when searching for food items (see Addendum <br><br><b>13066: </b>Testing Logs). The rest of its body appears to be covered by feathers similar to those found on normal chickens; however these feathers appear to have grown outwards instead towards the outside like normal feathers do (again see Addendum <br><br><b>13066: </b>Testing Logs). No other anomalous properties have been noted thus far regarding <i>SCP-13066</i>'s physical appearance/functionality/etc.; however more testing is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn about these aspects.<br><br><h3>Addendum 13066.1 : </h3><br><br><i>SCP-13066</i> was found to be capable of speech, albeit in a very limited manner. It is able to communicate simple ideas and questions such as <i>"food?"</i>, <i>"more food?"</i>, <i>"danger"</i>, and so on. However, it has never been observed to speak in full sentences or use any higher level communication skills.<br><br><h3>Addendum 13066.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-13066</i><br><br>The following interview was conducted by Dr. ████ after <i>SCP-13066</i> had been in containment for a month. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, <i>SCP-13066</i>, my name is Dr. ████. I am your primary interviewer while you are being held here at Site ██; however, I will not be the one to interview you today as I am currently busy with other tasks and cannot be here for this session of the interview. However, we will resume our interviews again soon so please do not worry about that! For now though, would you like some food? <br><br><b><i>SCP-13066</i>: </b>[<i>SCP-13066</i> makes a sound similar to that of a human sighing.] <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Excuse me? Did you say something? <br><br><b><i>SCP-13066</i>: </b>FOOD… PLEASE… MORE FOOD… [<i>SCP-13066</i> appears to be somewhat distressed.] <br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Oh yes! Of course! Here is some more KFC chicken right now; have as much as you want! <Dr. ████ hands <i>SCP-13066</i> another bucket of KFC chicken via an agent standing next to him who opens it and hands it over before leaving the room> There we go; enjoy your meal while we continue our conversation about your origins and how exactly you came into existence! Now then… can you tell me how long ago it was when this all happened? When did those <i>"creatures"</i> first appear on Earth? And what were they doing when they appeared here for the first time? Please answer any questions if possible; however if there is anything too difficult or painful for you to discuss then just let me know and we can move on from there okay? <i>SCP-130061</i> begins eating from its bucket of KFC chicken at this point without saying anything else in response to these questions for several minutes before finally responding again once its finished eating its meal (see Addendum 13067). <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 13066.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test #: 13066-1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-13066</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-7349 is to enter <i>SCP-13066</i>'s containment cell and attempt to communicate with it. D-class personnel are chosen for this test due to their expendability; if they are killed or injured by <i>SCP-13066</i>, it will not be considered a serious loss. However, if they manage to survive the encounter without any injuries, then that may indicate that <i>SCP-13066</i> is not hostile towards humans and can be safely contained in a less secure facility than Site ██.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon entering the room containing <i>SCP-13066</i>, D-7349 immediately began screaming and running towards the exit of the room as quickly as possible while continuously looking back at where he came from. He managed to reach the door before being attacked by <i>SCP-13066</i>; however he was unable to open it due to his hands shaking too much from fear (which is understandable). When asked why he ran away instead of attempting communication with what appeared to be an intelligent creature similar in appearance/functionality/etc. as himself, D7349 replied <i>"I didn't want my face eaten off!"</i><br><br>Test #: 13066 -2 Subject:SCP - 130 66 Procedure:D - 7 3 4 9 i s t o e n t e r c o n t a c t w i t h S C P - 1 3 0 6 6 .
