The key to the locker shall be kept on Dr.████’s person at all times. Any testing of <i>SCP-9640</i> must be approved by two (2) Level 4 personnel, and carried out in Testing Chamber A at Site-98.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9640</i> is a pair of black, leather gauntlets (<i>SCP-9640</i>-1 and <i>SCP-9640</i>-2) that attach to the forearms via a buckle and strap. The gloves appear to be made of goat hide, with the fingers being composed of several strips that have been sewn into place. Each hand bears a silver cuff on the wrist connected by two small lengths of chain. The fingertips are worn smooth as if in an attempt to dull them, and it is not possible to fit more than three digits from either hand into each glove; however, despite this they are still functional.<br><br>When worn by an individual capable of inflicting lethal injury onto another person (hereafter referred to as the <i>"Wielder"</i>), <i>SCP-9640</i> will immediately lower their inhibitions against murder on all conscious human beings within 25 meters . Wielding individuals will also gain an extremely profound desire for murder at random intervals, which can last anywhere from minutes to days depending on how often they wield <i>SCP-9640</i>; however, doing so causes no physical harm whatsoever . Once all humans within range have been killed or incapacitated beyond any possibility of resuscitation (hereafter referred to as “Extermination”), <i>SCP-9640</i> will fade away , leaving behind only its buckle and strap . Testing has shown no anomalous properties when attached onto artificial arms or other prosthetic limbs other than their wearer having increased strength while wielding them.<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9640</i> was discovered in a small cave by Foundation agents embedded in the Syrian military, who were on patrol during the First Battle of Aleppo. The Wielder was an unidentified Caucasian male in his twenties with a history of mental illness .<br><br><br>Interview 9640-1: Interviewed: Subject 9640-A<br><br><br>Interviewer: Dr.███████ <Begin Log> Dr.<br>███████: So, Mr ████████…can you tell me what happened here?<br> ████████: <pauses> Well…I don't know much about it myself, actually. I just woke up one morning and felt like killing everyone around me. And I did! The whole town! All these people are dead because of me! Dr.<br>███████: Okay…but there must have been some kind of catalyst that caused this to happen… ████████ Don't worry yourself too much about it; all you need to know is that now we're<br><br><h3>Addendum 9640.1 :</h3> <i>SCP-9640</i> was initially contained at Site-98 in the same locker as <i>SCP-</i>████ and <i>SCP-</i>████ under standard anomalous object protocols. On ██/██/20██, approximately one month after initial containment, <i>SCP-9640</i> (along with its fellow anomalous object) disappeared without a trace. A search of the surrounding area revealed no nearby empty space that could have been large enough to contain them; however, it is possible they were teleported away. The security tapes during this time confirmed that no personnel other than guards were near the locker in question during this time. Despite the high level of security at Site-98 and on Dr.████’s person, he has not reported any attempts of theft nor has he been reprimanded for negligence .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9640.2 :</h3> <i>SCP-9640</i> was reported missing from its containment locker on ██/██/20██, after the conclusion of testing. An investigation by the Site-98 administration found no signs of forced entry into the locker, nor any indication that <i>SCP-9640</i> could have been forcibly removed without causing damage to either it or any nearby objects .</div>
