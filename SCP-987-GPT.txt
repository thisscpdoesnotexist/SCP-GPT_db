Description: SCP-987-GPT is a small warehouse located in ████████, New Jersey. The anomalous property of SCP-987-GPT manifests upon the entrance of any living human beings within a 6.4 meter radius. Upon entrance, all living human beings within the radius experience a complete loss of memory of all persons present within the radius, including themselves. Subjects also experience a complete loss of any and all knowledge pertaining to their identities, their names, their places of birth, their jobs, their families, their friends, and all other personal and familial information. Subjects will now identify themselves as "Thomas Smith", but will not be able to provide any information as to who Thomas Smith is, or how they know this.

After 15 minutes inside the radius of SCP-987-GPT, all subjects will experience a complete loss of all memories they had before accessing SCP-987-GPT. All subjects will still identify themselves as "Thomas Smith", but will not be able to provide any information as to who Thomas Smith is, or how they know this.
