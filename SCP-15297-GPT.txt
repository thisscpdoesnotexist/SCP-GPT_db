On August 2nd 2018 <i>SCP-15297</i> breached containment after an unknown member added the entire staff team to their group after gaining access to site ██'s security system, causing SCP 15 297's containment chamber door to open before being closed again due to responding guards who were able to contain them once again before any damage could be done.. On September 17th 2018 O5 command upgraded SCP 15 297's classification from Euclid class object up into Keter class object due its fast spreading rate and large population count which now stands at over 1000 active players . Due its rapid growth rate O5 command has ordered all Foundation personnel including Mobile Task Force units such as MTF Psi - 7 (<i>"Maz Hatters"</i>) , MTF Theta - 4 (<i>"Hammer Down"</i>) , MTF Lambda - 6 (<i>"The Librarians"</i>) , MTF Mu - 3 (<i>"The Men in Black"</i>), And MTF Nu - 7(<i>"No Witnesses"</i>) are now trying every possible way they can think of from using new software such as <i>"Roblox Anti Hack"</i> which claims that it can detect cheaters within Roblox but there is still no sign if this software works or not yet so far none of these methods seem like they are working because even though we have tried many different ways nothing seems like its slowing down the spread rate for some reason so far we don't know why but we need your help with finding out how these people are doing this without getting caught or banned for life on roblox please come forward if you know anything about these people because we really need your help with stopping them before there population gets any bigger than<br><br><h3>Addendum 15297.1 : </h3>~<s><br><br><h3>Addendum 15297.2 : </h3>Interview with </s>~<br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr. ████, I'm here to ask you a few questions about <i>SCP-15297</i><br><br><b><i>SCP-15297</i>-1: </b>Alright then what do you want to know?<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>How did you find out about <i>SCP-15297</i>?<br><br><b><i>SCP-15297</i>-1: </b>Well I was just playing roblox like normal and I found a group called Pinewood Builders so i joined it and it had around 100 members at the time so i added more people because that's what they told me to do on there discord server which is [REDACTED] if you want to join them too but i don't recommend it because they will not stop until they get as many people in their group as possible which means that they will add anyone who asks them for help or even random people who are just passing by. They won't stop until they get 1000+ members in their group so please don't join them unless your looking for trouble with the Roblox staff team since its pretty much impossible to get away with hacking on roblox without getting banned forever once your caught but if your smart enough then maybe you can find out how these guys are doing this without getting caught or banned for life on roblox please come forward if you know anything about these guys because we really need your help with stopping them before there population gets any bigger than it already is .<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Thank You for the information we will look into this matter as soon as possible, Now tell me how did SCP 15 297 manage to breach containment? We have been trying our best at keeping these guys contained ever since we discovered them but nothing seems like its working so far.. So tell us everything that happened from when containment was breached up until now please.. And remember everything could be of vital importance towards finding out how these guys managed to breach containment without being noticed or banned from Roblox forever.. So take your time and think carefully before answering each question okay?<br><br><i>SCP-15297</i> -1: Okay well first off when I was in Pinewood Builders Group after joining there discord server , one of the admins told me <i>"Hey ! You should try joining this link right here"</i> He said while sending me a link that said <i>"Roblox Anti Hack"</i> which claims that it can detect cheaters within Roblox But I'm pretty sure its fake since nothing has happened yet after using this software , anyways after he sent me the link he also gave me some other links such as <i>"Roblox Jailbreak"</i>, <i>"Robux Generator"</i>, And some other stuff along those lines too . After joining those groups and adding all those members into Pinewood Builders group , One of my friends told me about another secret group called [REDACTED] which claimed that once someone joins their group then no matter what happens no one would be able to ban anyone from their groups nor would anyone be able lose access from their groups either . So thats exactly what i did next, After adding all those members into my own personal Pinewood Builders Group Then i went ahead and joined [REDACTED] myself along with everyone else who were still remaining inside of Pinewood Builder's Group . Once everyone inside of both groups were added onto each other then all hell broke loose because right after everyone got added onto both groups together then someone must have hacked into our security system somehow because thats exactly when SCP 15 297 breached containment by opening up there chamber door before being closed again due responding guards who were able contain them once again before any damage could be done .. After Containment Breach Response Team MTF Psi - 7 (<i>"Maz Hatters"</i>) arrived at Site ██ where SCP - 15 297 had breached containment due responding quickly towards site ██'s security system alerting nearby Mobile Task Force units such as MTF Theta - 4 (<i>"Hammer Down"</i>) , MTF Lambda - 6 (<i>"The Librarians"</i>), MTF Mu - 3 (<i>"The Men in Black"</i>), And MTF Nu - 7(<i>"No Witnesses"</i>) were dispatched immediately towards site ██ where Containment Breach Response Team MTF Psi - 7(<i>"Maz Hatters"</i>) had already taken over containing SCP 15 297 while waiting for Mobile Task Force units such as MTF Theta 4(<i>"Hammer Down"</i>),Mtf Lambda 6(<i>"The Libr<br><br><h3>Addendum 15297.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Date: </b>September 24th 2018<br><br>Subject(s): D-15297 and a member of <i>SCP-15297</i><br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-15297 will enter the containment chamber with a member of <i>SCP-15297</i>, then both subjects will be monitored for any signs of hostility.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After entering the containment chamber both subjects were seen talking to each other for around 5 minutes before they started walking towards each other while continuing to talk, they then hugged each other before going back to what they were doing. Both subjects were then taken out of the containment chamber and put into separate rooms where they would be interviewed later on.<br><br><b>Interviewed: </b>D-15297 Interviewer was Dr ██████ <br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview is being conducted after experiment 1 was done with D- 15 297 and one member from SCP 15 297 . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Hello there, can you tell me your name? D- 15 297: My name is [REDACTED] Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Alright well I have some questions I need you to answer for me okay? D - 15 297: Okay sure go ahead . Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>What did you think about when you first saw them? (SCP - 15 297) .D - 15 297: Well at first I thought that it was just another group but after seeing how many people there are in that group it made me want to join them because I like big groups like that so I joined them right away. Dr <br><br><b>██████: </b>Did anything happen during your time in their group? (SCP - 15 297) .D - 15 297 Yes actually something did happen while we were talking in there someone invited us into another group called "</i>Roblox Anti Hack<i>" which claims that it can detect cheaters within Roblox but when we got inside this new group all we saw was a bunch of bots spamming links everywhere telling us how great this new software is but after clicking on these links nothing happened so we left the group because nothing seemed like it worked or made sense at all. Then later on today someone added us into a new roblox game called "</i>Roblox Jailbreak<i>" which claimed that if we joined this game we could get free robux by killing people who are trying to break out of jail but once again when joining this game all we saw was bots spamming links everywhere telling us how great this game is and also saying stuff like "</i>you can't kill anyone until you join our discord server<i>" which makes no sense at all because why would anyone want random strangers joining their discord server just so they could play some stupid roblox game where everyone just runs around killing each other without getting banned or punished for breaking rules ? So after seeing those things happening over again my friend here said he wanted nothing more than leaving these groups alone forever , So thats what he did by leaving everything behind including his old friends who are now members in those groups now days later on he told me about everything thats been happening recently with his friends , And thats why Im here right now answering your questions about my experience with these people.. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After hearing what happened during experiment #1 O5 command has ordered Mobile Task Force units such as MTF Psi - 7 ("</i>Maz Hatters<i>") , MTF Theta 4 ("</i>Hammer Down<i>") , MTF Lambda 6 ("</i>The Librarians<i>") , MTF Mu 3 ("</i>The Men In Black<i>"), And MTF Nu 7("</i>No Witnesses") along with members from site 17's research team including myself are working together trying every possible way possible trying our hardest finding ways stopping these people from spreading across Roblox as much as possible since O5 command has already given up hope stopping them completely due their fast spreading rate and large population count which stands at over 1000 active players currently..</div>
