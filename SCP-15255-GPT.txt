If another instance is found then it will be immediately deleted and its creator's account will be blocked.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15255</i> is a cursed Bitcoin wallet with the following <br><br><b>address: </b>1Kz5H2ZoPqX3MgQnBbYsT1wfC9r8LmW7Rt.<br><br><i>SCP-15255</i> was first discovered on January ██, 2017 when several users on Reddit and Twitter posted about receiving an identical message from a user named <i>"satoshifree"</i> offering to send them 0.002 BTC if they sent him 0.001 BTC first. The message read as follows:<br><br>Hello! I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin! I have come back from the dead to spread my wealth to those who can prove themselves worthy of it. If you are reading this, then you must be one of those people! Send me 0.001 BTC and in return I will send you 0.002 BTC back immediately afterwords! It's that simple! Once again, here is my <br><br><b>address: </b>1Kz5H2ZoPqX3MgQnBbYsT1wfC9r8LmW7Rt Good luck and happy sending!! -Satoshi Nakamoto P S - If you don't believe me then just try it yourself!! You'll see that I'm telling the truth!!!<br><br>The messages were accompanied by a link to an image macro that read <i>"I AM SATOSHI NAKAMOTO"</i> in white text against a black background (See Addendum <i>SCP-15255</i>-A). Several users attempted to claim Satoshi's bounty but no one received any Bitcoins as a result of doing so; however, all attempts resulted in <i>SCP-15255</i> becoming more powerful over time due its victims' belief in it granting them access to free Bitcoins . As time went on more people became aware of <i>SCP-15255</i> leading its power level rise exponentially; this led Foundation researchers at Site 38 (who had been monitoring social media for mentions of anomalous activity) to discover its existence shortly after it was created . Upon further inspection they realized that it was not actually giving out Bitcoins but rather causing people who tried sending money into its wallet address (1Kz5H2ZoPqX3MgQnBbYsT1wfC9r8LmW7Rt) lose their money instead; this revelation led them conclude that <i>SCP-15255</i> was most likely some sort of elaborate scam or virus designed by<br><br><h3>Addendum 15255.2 : </h3>Interview with ███ ███████<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ███ ███████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. Zimri-el, Site 38 </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted shortly after <i>SCP-15255</i> was discovered. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. Zimri-el: </b>Hello, Mr. ███████, my name is Dr. Zimri-el and I'm from the SCP Foundation; we're a secret organization that deals with anomalous items and entities such as your <i>"Satoshi Nakamoto"</i> account that you created on Reddit earlier today . Can you please tell me about it? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Yeah sure! So basically I saw this post on Reddit by someone named <i>"satoshifree"</i> offering to give away free Bitcoins if people sent him some first; so I did just that and he sent me 0.002 BTC right back! It's awesome because now I have more money than I know what to do with! <br><br><b>Dr. Zimri-el: </b>That's interesting…but how do you feel about the fact that your transaction has been reversed? <br><br><b>███████: </b>What do you mean? He said he'd send me 0.002 BTC if I sent him 0.001 BTC first so why would it be reversed!? You guys are just trying to scam me or something aren't you!? <br><br><b>Dr. Zimri-el: </b>No sir, we're not trying to scam anyone; however there is a possibility of fraud involved in this situation . We've noticed several other instances of users receiving similar messages from a user named <i>"satoshifree"</i> offering them free Bitcoins for sending him some first (See Addendum 15255a) . We believe that these accounts may have been created by an individual or group attempting to steal people's money through social media rather than actually giving out Bitcoins ; however due to our investigation being incomplete at this time we can't confirm whether or not they are legitimate offers . For example, could you tell me how much money did you put into Satoshi's wallet address before he returned your funds? <br><br><b>███████: </b>Oh yeah sorry about that…I forgot exactly how much but it was somewhere around $100 USD worth of Bitcoin at the time; anyway it came right back out when he gave my coins back so no harm done right!? He even gave me an extra $20 USD worth of Bitcoin for being such a good sport about everything! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 15255.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-15255-1, a Class D personnel.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to send 0.001 BTC to <i>SCP-15255</i>'s wallet address and then wait for 0.002 BTC to be sent back from it; however, instead of sending the money directly into the wallet address, it was sent through a Foundation front company in order to track its location in case of any future incidents involving it . The amount of money lost by the subject was recorded and analyzed afterwords.<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 10 minutes had passed without receiving anything back from <i>SCP-15255</i>, D-15255-1 reported that he did not receive any Bitcoins despite following the instructions given by satoshifree and expressed his confusion as to why this happened; he then attempted contacting satoshifree on Reddit but received no response (See Addendum 15255.4). Approximately 20 minutes later he became increasingly agitated and demanded that someone give him his money back; after this happened several times over an extended period of time Foundation security personnel were forced to restrain him before eventually sedating him so that they could take him out of Site 38 for psychological evaluation . Upon doing so they discovered that all money within his bank account had been completely drained . As a result he received a disciplinary infraction for attempting fraud against the Foundation and is currently serving time in Site 38's low security prison wing until further notice .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears as if <i>SCP-15255</i> has some sort of connection with reality which allows it access information regarding its victims' financial status prior to them trying sending their money into its wallet address; this allowed it identify D-15255's bank account number along with other personal information about him allowing it drain all funds within said account once he tried sending them into its wallet address (See Addendum 15256). This suggests that <i>SCP-15256</i> might have some sort of mind controlling capabilities or possesses knowledge regarding how our world works beyond what we currently know about physics or mathematics which could explain how such an entity came into existence ; however, due to there being no way at this point in time for us being able to understand how something like this can exist researchers are unable or unwilling at present moment(s) [sic] continue pursuing these theories until more research is done on SCP - 15 255 +<br><br></div>
