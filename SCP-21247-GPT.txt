<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i>SCP-21247 is  the goddess of parts and services</i> </h3> </center><h3> Item #: </h3> SCP-21247<br><br><h3> Object Class: </h3>Keter<br><br><h3> Description: </h3> <i>SCP-21247</i> is a humanoid entity of indeterminate gender, standing approximately 2.4 meters in height and weighing approximately 250 kilograms. Its body is composed entirely of various mechanical parts, including gears, motors, springs and other components. It has an artificial face with no discernible features or expression beyond the occasional twitch or whirring sound emitted from its mouth area.<br><br><i>SCP-21247</i>'s primary anomalous property is that it can manipulate any type of mechanical part or device to perform any task it desires. This includes creating new objects out of existing parts, repairing broken items and even constructing entire machines from scratch. It can also use these abilities to directly control other machines such as vehicles or robots with precision accuracy if given enough time to do so.<br><br>In addition to its manipulation abilities <i>SCP-21247</i> also appears to possess some degree of sentience, although communication attempts have thus far been unsuccessful due to its lack of vocal cords or other means for speech production. Despite this limitation however it does appear capable of understanding basic commands given in English and responding appropriately when necessary (see Addendum 21247-A). <br><br><i>SCP-21247</i> was originally discovered after numerous reports were made by people living near [REDACTED], Germany claiming that their cars had suddenly started driving themselves without anyone at the wheel despite being parked securely beforehand; further investigation revealed <i>SCP-21247</i> lurking nearby manipulating the vehicles using its powers before disappearing back into the shadows once noticed by witnesses<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br><i>SCP-21247</i> is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be equipped with a variety of mechanical parts and devices for <i>SCP-21247</i> to use as it pleases, although any objects created by it must be removed from the cell and stored elsewhere when not in use.<br><br>Personnel assigned to interact with <i>SCP-21247</i> are required to wear protective clothing at all times due to the potential risk of injury posed by its manipulation abilities. Furthermore, no personnel are allowed within 5 meters of <i>SCP-21247</i> without permission from Level 4 personnel or higher. <br><br>Any attempts at communication with <i>SCP-21247</i> should first be approved by the Site Director before being attempted.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21247.1: </h3><br><br>Following the initial containment of <i>SCP-21247</i>, Foundation researchers have been able to establish a rudimentary form of communication with it. While not being able to produce any speech itself, it has shown an understanding of basic verbal commands given in English and is capable of responding by manipulating objects within its vicinity as if they were part of a conversation.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21247.2: </h3> Interview with <i>SCP-21247</i><br><br>On ██/██/████, personnel at Site-██ attempted to communicate with <i>SCP-21247</i> in order to gain further insight into its anomalous abilities. The following is a transcript of the interview:<br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Can you understand me? <br><b><br><i>SCP-21247</i>:</b> (No response) <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you know why we are here? <br><b><br> <i>SCP-21247</i>:</b> (Pauses for several seconds before nodding slowly) Yes. I am here because I can manipulate objects and machines with my mind. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Is that why you were in [REDACTED], Germany? <br><b><br><i>SCP-21247</i>:</b> Yes. I was looking for parts to use in my creations. I had heard that there were many machines and objects just waiting to be used. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> What do you plan to do with these parts? <br><b><br><i>SCP-21247</i>:</b> I want to create something new. Something that will help people and make their lives easier. <br><b><br>Interviewer:</b> Do you think that is possible? <br><b><br><i>SCP-21247</i>:</b> (Pauses for several seconds before nodding slowly) Yes. I believe it is possible.<br><br><h3> Addendum 21247.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment #:</b> 21247-01<br><b><br>Date:</b> ██/██/████ <br><b><br>Procedure:</b> An attempt was made to communicate with <i>SCP-21247</i> using a standard English phrasebook. <br><b><br>Result:</b> After several minutes of attempting to communicate, <i>SCP-21247</i> began manipulating nearby objects in an apparent attempt at sign language. It proceeded to spell out the words <i>"I HELP"</i> before returning to its normal behavior.</div>
