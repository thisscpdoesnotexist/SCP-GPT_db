The interviewer is Dr. ██████, a Level 3 researcher assigned to <i>SCP-9672</i>'s containment team.<br><br><Begin Log, [██:██]><br><br><br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Good morning, 9672. I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself and your abilities if that's alright with you?<br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9672</i>:</b> Sure thing! Ask away!<br><br><br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> Alright then… first off, what is your name?<br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9672</i>:</b> My name is John Smith! Or at least it was before I got stuck in here with all of you guys… but I guess that doesn't really matter now does it? You can call me whatever you want though! Just don't call me late for dinner or anything like that… oh wait… never mind on that last one haha!<br><br><br><b>Dr. ██████:</b> So then Mr Smith, how did you come into our custody? What were the circumstances surrounding your capture by the Foundation?<br><br><br><b><i>SCP-9672</i>:</b> Well doc… let me tell ya'll a story about my good friend Bob here (points to his right arm). It all started when Bob and I were just hanging out in my basement one day watching TV and eating some popcorn when suddenly this big ol' monster comes crashing through the wall right next to us and starts trying to eat us both up alive! So we start running around the room trying not to get eaten by this thing while also trying not to fall down any of those holes in the floor either because they looked pretty deep if ya know what I mean haha!! But anyways we finally manage to get away from this monster but then it turns out there are more monsters coming through every hole in the wall now so we have no choice but run up onto my roof where there aren't any holes at all so we're safe from those monsters at least for a little bit anyway!! But then just as soon as we get up onto my roof these other monsters show up too so now Bob and I are stuck on top of my house with nowhere else left for us go except jump off into thin air which would probably kill us both because neither one of us can fly or anything like that!! And even if somehow neither one of us died from falling off of my house maybe those other monsters would still be waiting down below ready eat both our bodies once they hit the ground or something like that!!! So anyways after thinking about all these bad things happening inside our heads Bob and myself decide maybe its best if we just jumped together instead of jumping alone because maybe together our chances might be better than jumping alone since there might only be enough room for only one monster underneath each person instead of two monsters under each person which could make things easier on both Bob and myself since its less likely either one of us will die during landing or something like that!! And sure enough once we jumped together everything went fine without any problems whatsoever!!! We landed safely without getting hurt at all thanks mostly due to luck heheh!!! After landing safely back down onto solid ground again though poor old Bob didn't survive his injuries unfortunately due mostly due again mainly due mainly mainly mainly due primarily primarily primarily primarily primarily primaryylyylyyyyyyyylyyyyyyyylyllyllyllyllylllllleeeeeeeeessssssssssttttttaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbooooooooobbbooooooooobbboooooooobbbooooooooooobbbbbbboooooooooooooppppppfffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuttttttthhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiinnnnnggggghhhhhhhh hhhhiinnnggghhhiinnnngghhiinghhiinghihiingihiinigigigigiiniggigiiniggiiniggigiiniggigiini niggignignignigniggnigngnigngniggnnniinnngginninggingginninggingginninggingginningginggi nninggingginninggingginninggingginsinsinsinsinsingsingsingsingsingsinginggsigsigsigsis ssinggsisisisisssinggsisssisssinggsisssisisis<br><br><h3><br><b>Addendum 9672.2 :</b></h3> Interview Log<br><br><b><br><b>Interviewed:</b>  <i>SCP-9672</i> </b> <br> <b><br><b>Interviewer:</b>  Dr. ██████ </b> <br> <b><br><b>Foreword:</b></b> The following interview was conducted after <i>SCP-9672</i> requested to speak with a researcher. <Begin Log><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Hello, 9672, I'm Dr. ██████. How are you feeling?<br><b> <i>SCP-9672</i>:</b> I feel fine, thank you for asking doctor! How are you?<br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> I'm doing well, thank you for asking 9672! Now then, why did you request to speak with me?<br><b> <i>SCP-9672</i>:</b> Well doctor…I've been thinking about my situation here and it's really not fair that they keep me locked up in this cell all the time without letting me go outside or do anything else fun! It's not like I can escape or anything! So…I was wondering if maybe we could work something out where I can get out of here more often and have some more freedom? Maybe even be allowed to leave the facility once in a while if there is somewhere safe that I could go to? You know what they say; <i>"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!"</i><br><b> Dr. ██████:</b> Hmm…well 9672 it seems like we may have found your motivation for good behavior! If we give you some freedoms then maybe that will help motivate you to behave yourself while being contained here at Site 19! Is that alright with you? <i>SCP-9672</i> nods enthusiastically Yes sir!! That sounds great!! Thank You so much Doctor!!! <End Log><br><b> Closing Statement:</b> Following this interview, permission has been granted by O5 Command for 9672 to be given increased freedoms within Site 19 as long as its behavior remains satisfactory during its containment at Site 19</div>
