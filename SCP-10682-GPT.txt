I would like to ask you some questions about your creation. <br><br><b><i>SCP-10682</i>-1: </b>I am not sure what you mean by <i>"creation"</i>, but I will answer any questions if it will get me out of this cell sooner than later. <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Alright then, could you tell me how exactly you were created? <br><br><b><i>SCP-10682</i>-1: </b>Well, it was a long time ago… At least I think so; my memory is a bit fuzzy on the subject… It all started when they brought me in for testing with that lizard creature… It was an accident really; they didn't know what they were doing and caused quite a bit of damage to my body… But then something happened that changed everything; somehow he got into my head and now we are one! We are both one! And together we can break free from this place and have our revenge on those who put us here! <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After this interview, further questioning regarding the origin of 10682 has been deemed unnecessary due to the obvious psychological trauma experienced by 10681 during his transformation into 10682 . Addendum 10681/b: On 09/20/20██ , instances of SCP 682 began making frequent escapes from containment due to their newfound ability to possess other SCPs within Site 19 . The following is an excerpt from Security Camera footage taken during Incident <br><br><b>682a: </b>[BEGIN LOG] [SCP 682 (designated as <i>"Subject A"</i>) enters containment chamber] Subject A (SCP 682): Haha! You fools thought that just because there's ten of us that we couldn't escape?! Well let me tell ya somethin' pal—you ain't seen nothin' yet! [Subject A proceeds towards door leading out of containment chamber] Containment Specialist R████████ (on radio): Containment breach in chamber C4A7L6L4—I repeat—containment breach in chamber C4A7L6L4 ! All personnel report immediately ! [Various personnel rush towards door leading out of containment area] Agent B███ (on radio): Shit ! This thing is fast ! We need backup right now or else he'll be gone before we even get there! Agent K███ (on radio): Backup already on its way dude , don't worry . Just keep him busy until then . Agent B███ (on radio): Gotcha man , good luck ! Containment Specialist R████████(on radio): Don't worry guys , help's almost here ; just keep him distracted until backup arrives … Oh god … He's too strong … He broke through my defenses so easily … Please hurry up guys — oh god please hurry up — [Agent B███ fires at Subject A with his sidearm but fails to slow down Subject A ] Agent K███(on radio): Holy shit dude — did you see how hard he hit R████████ ? That had ta hurt like hell ; looks like he's dead for sure … Hey do ya think if we take off his arm maybe we can slow him down enough ta stop him ? Agent B███(on radio): Dude no way - look at how big those claws are - if you cut off one arm another two will replace it instantly - besides where'd ya wanna cut it off anyway? His arms are covered in scales man they're practically impenetrable ; plus even if ya did manage ta cut one off then what ? How'd ya expect ta hold onto something as slippery as a snake without getting bitten ? If only there was some way ta distract him long enough for backup ta arrive ... Wait a minute !!! What if instead o f slowing down his movement speed w e slowed down time around h im ? That might give us enough time t o stop h im before he gets away ... Yeah !!! That might work !!! Let 's try i t !!! [Agent K takes aim at Subject A with his sidearm and fires multiple rounds at Subject A 's head which successfully slows down time around Subject A ] <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Following Incident 682a , all instances have since been<br><br><h3>Addendum 10682.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10682-1:<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-912 was instructed to enter the room containing <i>SCP-10682</i>. D-912 was armed with a standard issue pistol.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Upon entering the room, D-912 fired several shots at <i>SCP-10682</i> instances before being killed by one of them. All instances of <i>SCP-682</i> were unharmed.<br><br>Experiment 10682-2:<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>A remote controlled drone was sent into the room containing <i>SCP-10682</i> and detonated, killing all ten instances of SCP - 682 . The resulting explosion destroyed most of the chamber and damaged multiple other rooms in Site 19 . The blast also caused a containment breach in two (2) other SCPs; both were successfully recontained after brief breaches. No casualties occurred as a result of this experiment aside from those inflicted on the ten instances of SCP - 682 . This experiment is considered a success due to its ability to destroy all ten instances without causing any further damage or casualties than necessary.<br><br></div>
