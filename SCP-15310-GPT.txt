When Dr.███████ and his team arrived at the house where <i>SCP-15310</i> had lived, they found him dead on his bed with a note next to him saying <i>"I'm sorry."</i> After finding this out, Dr.███████ and his team decided to go back home instead of killing themselves because they thought that it would be too much work for them if they did so but then again, nobody knows why he didn't do it anyway…<br><br><h3>Addendum 15310.1 : </h3>█████████, England<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-15310</i> was found in the middle of the town of ██████████, England. The people who were there when he was found were Dr.███████ and his team of researchers as well as a group of police officers who had been sent to kill <i>SCP-15310</i>. When Dr.███████ and his team arrived at the town where they had found <i>SCP-15310</i>, they noticed that there were many dead bodies lying around in the streets and on top of buildings while some people were still alive but not for long because they soon died too after seeing all those dead bodies lying around in their town. When Dr.███████ asked one of the police officers what happened here, he said <i>"One day we woke up to find out that all our friends and family members are dead… We don't know how this happened or even why it happened but we think that it might be a gay man who did this."</i> After hearing this from one of the police officers, Dr.███████ realized that he might have been wrong about thinking that it wasn't a gay man after all so then he decided to call for backup from other special containment units so that they could help him with capturing <i>SCP-15310</i> before more people got killed by him again…<br><br><h3>Addendum 15310.2 : </h3>Interview with ████████, England<br><br>The following is an interview with one of the survivors who lived through the attack on ██████████, England. The interview was conducted by Dr.███████ and his research team after they had captured <i>SCP-15310</i> and put him in a cell for further testing.<br><br><b>Dr.███████: </b>Hello, my name is Dr.███████ and I'm here to ask you some questions about what happened here in ██████████ on ██/██/████… Can you tell me what happened?<br><br><b>Survivor: </b>Well… It all started when we woke up one morning to find out that all our friends and family members are dead… We don't know how this happened or even why it happened but we think that it might be a gay man who did this to us…<br><br><b>Dr.███████: </b>A gay man? Why would you say that?<br><br><b>Survivor: </b>Because there were two men walking down the street holding hands when we saw them so then I decided to go talk to them but then suddenly they turned around in their bodies so that their back sides faced us while also turning into skeletons which scared us because we didn't know what was going on at first until one of our friends told us that those people are ghosts now so then he told us not to look at them anymore because if they see you looking at them, they'll kill you too just like they killed everyone else here in town! So then after hearing this from him, I ran away as fast as I could before those ghosts could catch me!<br><br><h3>Addendum 15310.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Note: </b>All of the experiments that are going to be listed below were performed by Dr.███████ and his team of researchers.<br><br>Experiment #1: On ██/██/████, Dr.███████ and his team decided to test <i>SCP-15310</i>'s ability to kill people who aren't LGBT so they set up a room with one guard inside it while the other guards were outside the room waiting for <i>SCP-15310</i> to appear so they could shoot him with their guns but then again, nobody knows why he didn't do it anyway… After setting up everything that they needed for this experiment, Dr.███████ went into the room where the guard was while he told everyone else outside of it not to go in there until he says so… After 5 minutes later when Dr.███████ came out from behind the door, he said <i>"<i>SCP-15310</i> has killed our guard."</i> When asked what happened inside there after saying that sentence, Dr.███████ responded by saying <i>"He just walked in here without even killing anyone and then I saw him kill our guard but I don't know how."</i> After hearing this from him, everyone else started wondering if maybe <i>SCP-15310</i> isn't really an unkillable person after all or if maybe we're all just wrong about thinking that way about him…<br><br>Experiment #2: On ██/██/████, a group of police officers decided to go into a room where <i>SCP-15310</i> was supposed to be at because they wanted see if he is really unkillable or not since none of them had seen him yet before today so when they entered into the room where he was supposed to be at first nothing happened but then suddenly one officer said <i>"I can see something!"</i> Everyone else turned around and looked at what she was looking at which turned out being <i>SCP-15310</i> standing right next her but then again nobody knows why she didn't do anything about it… Then another officer said <i>"It looks like a gay man!"</i> Then another officer said <i>"We should shoot him now!"</i> But before any police officers could even pull out their guns or even try shooting them towards <i>SCP-15310</i>'s head or body parts for some reason unknown by anyone else except for those police officers themselves who decided not too after realizing something important about themselves which is also known as [DATA EXPUNGED] which made them realize that killing someone like this is wrong no matter what kind of person you are because no matter what kind of person you are you will always have feelings too!</div>
