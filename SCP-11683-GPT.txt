<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-11683</i> is  an Ocarina of Time</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-11683</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-11683</i> is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. No personnel are to play <i>SCP-11683</i> without the approval of Dr. ██████ and all personnel who have played it are to be quarantined for observation until they can be cleared by medical staff .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-11683</i> is a replica of a standard Ocarina of Time. The item has the appearance of an ocarina made out of clay, with the exception that it is painted red, yellow and green. The item was found in ████████, Indonesia.<br><br><i>SCP-11683</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when it is played by a human being within visual range of <i>SCP-11683</i>. When this occurs, all humans within visual range will perceive <i>SCP-11683</i> as an Ocarina of Time (hereafter referred to as <i>SCP-11683</i>-1). All humans who perceive <i>SCP-11683</i> as an Ocarina will believe that they are playing it themselves and will be unable to see or hear any other humans playing the instrument. This effect extends to video recordings; when viewed by a human subject who perceives <i>SCP-11684</i> as an Ocarina, all video footage recorded from their perspective will show them holding and playing the object instead of any other person present in the recording . No other forms of recording have been affected by this anomaly . Subjects viewing recordings which feature them miming along with another person who has perceived SCP - 11 683 - 1 will report seeing themselves miming along with another person holding what they believe to be one instance each of both instances observed in said recording , despite only one instance being present on each occasion . Researchers have determined that individuals exposed to multiple instances simultaneously are able to discern between them without issue .<br><br>When played for approximately ten minutes , subjects report hearing <i>"a voice"</i> telling them how much time remains until [DATA EXPUNGED]. If left undisturbed for more than twenty minutes after hearing this message, subjects begin speaking entirely in reverse speech , often repeating phrases such as <i>"I am not myself"</i> or <i>"I am not you"</i>. After thirty minutes pass without interruption from outside sources (such as researchers), subjects begin experiencing severe physical trauma while continuing their speech patterns; these include but are not limited to: [DATA EXPUNGED] before expiring due to blood loss or organ failure . This process takes approximately three hours until completion unless interrupted before then; however if left uninterrupted for longer than five hours after exposure begins there is no known way currently available at Foundation facilities capable stopping it short except through termination via gunshot or blunt force trauma prior death occurs naturally due to blood loss or organ failure caused by internal bleeding ; however if terminated via gunshot wounds before death occurs naturally causes no further anomalous effects beyond<br><br><h3>Addendum 11683.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ ███████, who played <i>SCP-11683</i> and experienced the effects of its anomaly.<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> ████████ █████████, a researcher at Site-██ who was exposed to <i>SCP-11683</i>'s effects. </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ██████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following interview was conducted after it was discovered that Mr. █████████ had been affected by <i>SCP-11683</i>'s anomalous properties while conducting research on the item in question . <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Hello, Mr. █████████? How are you feeling? Mr. █████████ appears to be staring at an empty chair across from him; he does not respond to the doctor's question for several seconds before responding with what sounds like a voice coming from somewhere other than his mouth . <br><br><b>Voice: </b>I'm not myself… I'm not you… <br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Can you tell me what happened when this occurred? Mr.: [DATA EXPUNGED] …I don't feel so well… (Mr. [REDACTED] begins experiencing severe physical trauma.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After approximately five minutes of exposure to <i>SCP-11683</i>, Dr . [REDACTED] expired due to blood loss and organ failure caused by internal bleeding .<br><br><h3>Addendum 11683.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 11683-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-11683-1, a male caucasian of average build.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to play <i>SCP-11683</i> while researchers watched from behind a one way mirror. After playing the item for approximately ten minutes, subject reported hearing <i>"a voice"</i> telling him that he had ten minutes left until [DATA EXPUNGED]. After twenty minutes passed without incident, subject began speaking entirely in reverse speech and continued to do so for an additional thirty minutes before expiring due to blood loss or organ failure . Autopsy revealed no abnormalities in D-11683's body other than damage caused by the anomalous effects of SCP - 11 683 . The subject's corpse was incinerated following autopsy. No further testing is required at this time .<br><br>Experiment 11683 - 2:</div>
