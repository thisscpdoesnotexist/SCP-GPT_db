Like, at least seven feet tall, and her arms were as big as my legs! I swear to god she could have snapped me in half if she wanted to. She looked like a man too, but… different. Her voice was really deep and her face was all hairy, but… I don't know how to explain it. It wasn't like a man's beard or anything; it was just hair on her face like a girl's would be if she shaved it off. And there were these weird things on her chest too; they looked like boobs, but they were flat and hairy and had little nipples that stuck out from them. But the weirdest part of all is that when we saw each other for the first time… I think she recognized me! Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>Recognized you? How so? <br><br><b>██████████████: </b>It's hard to describe what happened exactly, but when we saw each other for the first time… something clicked inside of me. Like I knew who she was somehow even though we'd never met before in my life! And then after we fought for a while… well let's just say that I'm not really sure why we started fighting at all anymore after that point because by then it felt more like playing than fighting anyway! Agent <br><br><b>████: </b>So are you saying that this woman is someone you know personally? <br><br><b>██████████████: </b>No way man! We've never met before in our lives; trust me on this one. But whatever happened between us during our fight must have brought us closer together or something because afterwards when they took her away from me I felt really sad about it—like someone had ripped out my heart or something—and now every night since then when I go to bed all I can think about is getting back together with her again someday soon so that maybe next time things'll work out better between us than they did last time around . Agent ████ pauses briefly before continuing his line of questioning . Agent █¶7: How long do you think this <i>"next time"</i> will take? ████████████¶7: Oh hell no dude; don't even go there with your bullshit questions about my feelings towards girls . My girlfriend will be back here soon enough and then everything will be fine again once more . <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br><h3>Addendum 10373.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>+ Show Experiment Log - Hide Experiment Log Test 10373-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10373</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-10373</i> is to be interviewed by Dr. ██████.<br><br><b>Interviewer: </b>Dr. ██████<br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted shortly after the apprehension of <i>SCP-10373</i>, in an attempt to ascertain her origins and motives for attacking Mobile Task Force Phi-7 operatives. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ██████: </b>Good morning, 10373!
