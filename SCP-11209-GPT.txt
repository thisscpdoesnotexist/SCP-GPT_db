It is believed that this was an attempt by SCP - 11209 at escaping containment by disguising itself as a regular animal .<br><br><h3>Item #:</h3> SCP - 11210 <h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> Due t o it 's nature , no physical means can be used t o contain SCP - 1 21 0 . All information regarding its existence is t o be kept away from civilians under any circumstances . If any civilians come into contact wit h information regarding its existence , they must be detained and interrogated immediately . <h3>Description:</h3> SCP - 1 21 0 is an anomalous phenomenon that occurs in areas where there has been a recent death of an individual aged between 15 and 20 years old . All deaths caused directly or indirectly by another human being will trigger the manifestation of one instance of SCP - 1 21 0 within 7 days after the death of said individual if their name has been mentioned on television at least once during that time period ; if their name has not been mentioned on television during this time period , no instances will manifest regardless of other factors Note from Doctor Sato Hideki [SCP Foundation Researcher] As per our conversation earlier today, I have removed all references to names being mentioned on TV so as not to attract attention from anyone who might read this document without proper clearance; however, I would still like it noted in these documents that we cannot rule out any other factors which could cause manifestations besides names being mentioned on TV due to our lack of understanding about how this anomaly works exactly although we suspect it may have something related with human psychology after observing many test subjects who were exposed directly or indirectly through media reports about previous manifestations but did not experience any hallucinations themselves until they actually came into contact with affected areas despite having never seen them before which suggests some sort of telepathic connection between affected individuals themselves which may explain why only certain people seem affected by this anomaly while others do not even when they are exposed directly through media reports about previous manifestations despite having never seen them before possibly because those who did see them were already psychologically vulnerable due to their exposure through media reports about previous manifestations whereas those who did not see them were either less psychologically vulnerable than those who had seen them due t o their lack thereof or simply because they had no connection whatsoever with those individuals whose deaths triggered previous manifestations despite having never met them personally prior t o their deaths possibly because they simply didn't know anything about said individuals whose deaths triggered previous manifestations beforehand unlike those who saw images depicting what happened prior t o such events while others simply didn't care enough abou t such events happening elsewhere since there was nothing personal involved unlike those previously described above thus explaining why only certain people seem affected by this anomaly while others do n ot even when they are exposed directly through media reports abou t previous incidents albeit indirect ly Note fr om Doctor Sato Hideki [SCP Foundation Researcher] As per our conversation earlier today, I have removed all references indicating that only certain people seem affected by this anomaly while others do n ot even when they are exposed directl y through med ia report s abo ut previou s incidents althoug h indire<br><br><h3>Addendum 11209.3 : </h3>Experiment Log  Experiment Log 11209<br><br>Experiment #: 1<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-11209</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-11209</i> was placed in a room with one D-class personnel.
