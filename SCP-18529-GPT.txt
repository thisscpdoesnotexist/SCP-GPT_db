The program consists of a single man's face, with no other features or background visible.<br><br>When viewed by any human, <i>SCP-18529</i> will cause them to become entranced and unable to move until the broadcast ends. During this time, the man's face on <i>SCP-18529</i> will begin to emit a low humming noise which gradually increases in volume as it progresses. After approximately one hour into the broadcast, children and infants within a 5 km radius of where <i>SCP-18529</i> is being watched will begin to disappear without trace or warning. These individuals are believed to have been taken by an unknown entity under control of <i>SCP-18529</i>'s effects.<br><br>Attempts at blocking transmission of <i>SCP-18529</i> have proven ineffective; if blocked via traditional methods such as cable boxes or satellite dishes, then it will instead be received through radio waves transmitted directly into receivers regardless of distance from its source. As such, containment efforts must focus on preventing people from watching it while simultaneously researching ways to counter its effects and locate those taken by it.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3><br><br>• All broadcasts of <i>SCP-18529</i> are to be monitored by Foundation personnel and any attempts to view it must be immediately reported.<br><br>• Any individuals who have been affected by <i>SCP-18529</i>'s effects are to be taken into Foundation custody for further study.<br><br>• Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>) is to be dispatched in order to investigate the source of <i>SCP-18529</i> and locate those taken by it, as well as research ways to counter its effects.<br><br>• All major networks in the United States are required to broadcast a warning before airing <i>SCP-18529</i>, informing viewers not to watch it under any circumstances.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18529.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>) was dispatched to investigate the source of <i>SCP-18529</i>. After a three day search, they were able to locate a small cabin in rural [REDACTED] which appeared to be the broadcast's origin point. Upon entering the cabin, MTF Gamma-5 found that it had been abandoned for several years and contained no useful information or leads as to who may have been responsible for <i>SCP-18529</i>'s transmission.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18529.2: </h3> Interview with a Victim<br><br>On ██/██/20██, a Foundation agent posing as a social worker was able to interview one of the individuals taken by <i>SCP-18529</i>. The following is an excerpt from their conversation:<br><b><br>Agent:</b> Can you tell me what happened?<br><b><br>Victim:</b> I was just watching TV, like normal. Then this weird face came on and it started humming. I couldn't move, but then I felt something grab me and pull me away. When I woke up, I was here… wherever here is.<br><b><br>Agent:</b> Do you remember anything else?<br><b><br>Victim:</b> No… I just remember the face. It was like it was looking right at me, and then I felt like I couldn't move.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18529.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><b><br>Experiment 18529.1:</b><br><b><br>Subject:</b> D-2189, a 38 year old male with no prior history of mental illness.<br><b><br>Procedure:</b> Subject was instructed to watch <i>SCP-18529</i> for the duration of its broadcast. Monitoring equipment was set up in order to observe any changes in behavior or physical state.<br><b><br>Results:</b> After approximately one hour into the broadcast, subject began to exhibit signs of distress and panic, attempting to turn off their television but unable to do so due to <i>SCP-18529</i>'s effects. Subject then began screaming and thrashing about before falling unconscious after approximately ten minutes from the start of this phase. Upon awakening, subject reported that they had seen a figure behind them while watching <i>SCP-18529</i> which had taken them away from their home and placed them in an unknown location; however, no trace could be found upon investigation by Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (<i>"Red Herrings"</i>).</div>
