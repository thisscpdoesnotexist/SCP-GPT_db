Can you tell me what happened?<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Well, it was like any other day in [REDACTED], I was walking around and doing my job when I saw this pair of glasses on the floor. It wasn’t anything special so I picked it up and put it in my pocket for later use. Later that night when I got home, there were some reports of a robbery nearby so we had to go check it out but as soon as we got there all hell broke loose…<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>What do you mean by that?<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Well… We were just getting ready to head into the building when suddenly everyone started screaming and running away from something or someone but no one could see anything or anyone! Then after about 10 minutes or so everything went back to normal and we headed inside only to find nothing at all! We searched every inch of that place but there was nothing! That’s when I remembered what happened earlier with those glasses… So after a while we left only for me to realize they were still in my pocket… So after a while more of searching around town for clues on what happened earlier, then finally decided to try them on just out of curiosity… And that’s how everything began..<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Can you please elaborate? What did happen?<br><br>Agent <br><br><b>█████████: </b>Well…. The first thing that changed was my vision which turned into some sorta weird vision like if someone put all these different pictures together without actually taking them from any place at all then threw them onto a screen then showed them off one by one very quickly except each picture is taken from another picture with an even bigger screen behind it which shows off yet another set of pictures until infinity is reached….. Then once everything stopped moving around like crazy…. Everything looked normal again.. But not really.. It looked kinda fake if ya know what i mean.. Like everything had been drawn onto paper using crayons instead of being real... Then i heard these voices coming from nowhere saying stuff like ‘Hey look at me!' 'I'm over here!' 'Look over here!' 'I'm right next door' ‘I'm behind you!' ‘Behind your right shoulder' ‘Behind your left shoulder' etc etc..... After hearing enough voices talking about stuff i cant see nor hear except for their voices themselves i decided its time to take this stupid thing off before something bad happens.... But before i could take em off these two guys wearing white suits appeared outta nowhere saying they're gonna help me get rid of whatever's going on.... They told me they'll make things better than ever before... So i let em do whatever they wanted..... After a while things started turning back into normal again only this time its even worse than before.... Now its almost impossible trying seeing straight without seeing double images everywhere...... Its horrible..... Its unbearable........ Im sorry....... Im sorry........ Please forgive me.........<br><br><h3>Addendum 16902.3 : </h3>Experiment Log<br><br><b>Subject: </b>D-16902, male, 28.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>D-16902 is to wear <i>SCP-16902</i> for a period of 10 minutes.
