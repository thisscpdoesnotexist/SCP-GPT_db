The house is located at the intersection of ██████████ and ████████ streets in Minsk, Belarus.<br><br>The fire within <i>SCP-15644</i>'s walls does not spread to any other areas of the building, nor does it burn outside. Despite this, the inside of the building is always hot enough to cause third degree burns upon contact with skin for all non-Foundation personnel who enter. The temperature inside <i>SCP-15644</i> can be lowered by approximately 1 °C per minute through use of a cooling system developed by Foundation researchers; however, this process takes approximately 3 hours to complete and requires an amount of water equal to that which would be required for extinguishing an ordinary house fire.<br><br><i>SCP-15644</i> was discovered when Foundation agents embedded within Belarusian government agencies noticed reports from multiple sources (including local residents) about a <i>"house on fire"</i> in Minsk that had persisted for over 40 years without spreading or being extinguished despite no apparent source of fuel or ignition present nearby. Upon investigation, Agents discovered that <i>SCP-15644</i> was completely unoccupied despite being fully furnished and containing foodstuffs sufficient to sustain two adults indefinitely; testing revealed traces of human DNA present within these foodstuffs but no living humans were found anywhere near <i>SCP-15644</i> during initial investigation (later exploration revealed signs indicating that there had been several people living in <i>SCP-15644</i> at some point). It should be noted that due to [DATA EXPUNGED] , it's impossible for anyone currently alive today (including Foundation personnel) who have not read Document 15444/5549/Omega prior to its destruction by [DATA EXPUNGED] .

The interview was conducted in Russian; however, the transcript has been translated into English for clarity.<br><br><h3>Addendum 15644.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>The following is a log of experiments conducted on <i>SCP-15644</i>. All experiments were conducted by Dr. ██████ with the approval of Site Director ████.<br><br>Experiment #: 1 <br><br><b>Date: </b>11/12/2014 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>One (1) D-class personnel, D-5549 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-15644</i> and report what he saw inside. <br><br><b>Results: </b>[DATA EXPUNGED] <END LOG> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It is unknown how the fire started at this time; however, it is believed that it may have been started by <i>SCP-15644</i>'s occupant(s) as a result of their despair over [DATA EXPUNGED]. Experiment #2 <br><br><b>Date: </b>12/23/2014 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>One (1) D-class personnel, D-5549 <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Subject was instructed to enter <i>SCP-15644</i> and report what he saw inside. <br><br><b>Results: </b>[DATA EXPUNGED] <END LOG> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>The subject's body was found in the kitchen area of <i>SCP-15644</i> next to several pots containing foodstuffs; these foodstuffs contained traces of human DNA matching those present in samples taken from within SCP 1564 4 . Experiment #3 <br><br><b>Date: </b>1/20/2015 <br><br><b>Subject: </b>One (1) Junior Researcher assigned to Project Omicron - Omega Protocols , Junior Researcher ████ <br><br><b>Procedure: </b>Junior Researcher ████ entered SCP - 1564 4 and attempted to lower its temperature through use of an air conditioner installed within its walls . <br><br><b>Results: </b>After approximately 2 hours , the temperature within 15 6 44 dropped below 30 ° C ; however , after approximately 7 hours , it had risen back up above 30 ° C again . No other anomalous properties were observed during this experiment . Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>It appears that lowering the temperature within 15 6 44 takes significantly longer than raising it ; further research into this phenomenon is required before we can begin using this method for lowering its temperature on a regular basis .</div>
