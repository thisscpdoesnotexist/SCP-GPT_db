The exterior of <i>SCP-18068</i> appears to be a standard two-story house, however upon entering it becomes apparent that the interior is much larger than expected.<br><br>The interior of <i>SCP-18068</i> consists of numerous hallways and rooms, many of which are interconnected by doors or passageways. The exact layout and size of these areas varies from visit to visit, making navigation difficult for those unfamiliar with the structure. It has been noted that certain areas appear to be designed for specific purposes such as recreation or storage.<br><br><i>SCP-18068</i>'s anomalous properties manifest when an individual enters one room and then exits through another door in the same room; this causes them to enter a new area within <i>SCP-18068</i> which does not match their original destination nor does it match any other area previously observed within <i>SCP-18068</i>. It has been theorized that this phenomenon occurs due to some form of extradimensional space contained within <i>SCP-18068</i>'s walls; however further investigation is required before any definitive conclusion can be made.<br><br><h3> Special Containment Procedures: </h3> <i>SCP-18068</i> is to be monitored by Foundation personnel at all times. No unauthorized personnel are allowed access to <i>SCP-18068</i> without prior approval from the Site Director. All individuals entering <i>SCP-18068</i> must be accompanied by a minimum of two (2) armed security personnel and must remain in constant contact with them via radio or other communication device.<br><br>Any items removed from <i>SCP-18068</i> must be logged and stored in a secure location for further study. Any attempts to explore beyond the known areas of <i>SCP-18068</i> are strictly prohibited unless authorized by the Site Director or higher authority.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18068.1: </h3> On ██/██/20██, a team of Foundation personnel entered <i>SCP-18068</i> in order to explore its anomalous properties. The team was able to successfully navigate the interior of <i>SCP-18068</i> and discovered several areas which had not been previously observed. These included a large library, an armory, and a laboratory. It is currently unknown what purpose these areas served or who may have used them in the past.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18068.2: </h3> Interview with D-7888<br><b><br><b>Interviewed: </b> D-7888<br><b><br></b> <b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████<br><b><br></b> <br> Foreword:</b> D-7888 was instructed to explore <i>SCP-18068</i>.<br><br>&ltBegin Log&gt<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Please describe your experience exploring <i>SCP-18068</i>.<br><b><br>D-7888:</b> It was really weird, like I had been there before but I hadn't. There were a lot of rooms and they all seemed to be connected somehow, but it wasn't like any house I've ever seen before. It felt like it went on forever and yet at the same time it felt small and cramped. It was really disorienting…I don't know how else to explain it.<br><b><br>Dr. ████:</b> Did you find anything of note while exploring <i>SCP-18068</i>?<br><b><br>D-7888:</b> Yeah, I found a few things. There were some old books and furniture scattered around, but nothing that seemed particularly out of the ordinary. The only thing that really stood out was this one room with a bunch of strange symbols painted on the walls…I couldn't make any sense of them though.<br><br>&ltEnd Log&gt<br><b><br>Closing Statement:</b> D-7888 was administered a Class-A amnestic and returned to their cell.<br><br><h3> Addendum 18068.3: </h3> Experiment Log<br><br>On ██/██/20██, personnel were sent into <i>SCP-18068</i> to explore its interior and attempt to map the structure. The following is a log of their findings:<br><br>• Upon entering <i>SCP-18068</i>, personnel noted that the hallway they had entered was much longer than expected. After walking for approximately ten minutes, they arrived at a large chamber containing several doors leading to other areas of <i>SCP-18068</i>.<br><br>• Personnel attempted to open all of the doors in the chamber; however only one opened. Upon entering this room, personnel discovered an area filled with various items such as furniture, bookshelves and paintings which did not match any other area observed within <i>SCP-18068</i> thus far.<br><br>• Personnel continued exploring and eventually came across a large library containing numerous books written in unknown languages. Analysis of these texts revealed them to be written in ancient Sumerian dialects which have been extinct for thousands of years. It is currently unknown how these texts came into existence within <i>SCP-18068</i>'s walls or what purpose they may serve.</div>
