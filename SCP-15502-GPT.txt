The origin of these claims are currently unknown but are being investigated by Foundation researchers .<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-15502</i> is a small, purple stuffed animal with a large smile and eyes. <i>SCP-15502</i> is animate and capable of speech in the French language.<br><br><i>SCP-15502</i> was recovered from the home of ██████ ███████, who claimed to have found it on his doorstep one morning. <i>SCP-15502</i> has consistently refused to divulge any information about its origin or how it arrived at Mr. ███████'s home, but claims that it wishes to be taken care of by Mr. ███████ and his family indefinitely .<br><br>When <i>SCP-15502</i> is not being interacted with directly , it will attempt to make itself useful around the house by performing tasks such as cleaning, cooking food for the family, or tidying up after them . These actions are performed without prompting or instruction from any member of the household; however , all tasks performed by <i>SCP-15502</i> are completed perfectly every time . This behavior persists even when no member of Mr. ███████'s immediate family is present in their home; however , if they are away for an extended period of time (usually more than 24 hours), <i>SCP-15502</i> will become despondent and refuse to perform any more tasks until they return . If left alone for too long without attention from anyone within the household (including pets), <i>SCP-15</i> 502 will begin crying loudly until someone interacts with it again . It has been observed that this behavior increases in severity over time if left untreated; eventually resulting in self harm via laceration with sharp objects or blunt force trauma against hard surfaces such as walls or floors . The wounds inflicted upon itself heal at an accelerated rate when not being directly observed; usually within 5 - 10 minutes after being inflicted . This effect also applies when interacting with other members within its household ; wounds inflicted upon them during outbursts heal at an accelerated rate while not under observation as well [ see addendum 15 502 - 1].<br><br>SCP 15 502's anomalous properties manifest whenever it comes into contact with another living organism that can perceive its existence (hereafter referred to as <i>"subject"</i>). Upon making contact with a subject's skin, blood vessels along their body begin rapidly expanding and contracting while emitting a faint purple light similar in coloration to that emitted by blood vessels under normal conditions ; these effects cease immediately once contact between subject and object ceases [ see addendum 15 502 - 2]. Subjects report feeling no pain during this process but often express discomfort due to its abnormal nature<br><br><h3>Addendum 15502.1 : </h3>********** Interview Log 15502-1 **********<br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-15502</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ████ </b><br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. ████: </b>Good afternoon, <i>SCP-15502</i>.

Subject was instructed to remain still during this process . After making contact with subject's skin, <i>SCP-15</i> 502 began expanding and contracting its blood vessels as usual; however , no light was emitted from the subject's body . Subject reported feeling no pain or discomfort during this process .
