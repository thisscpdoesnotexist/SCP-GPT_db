Foundation personnel are to be informed of the existence of <i>SCP-9104</i>, and told that it is an anomalous object within Site-64, but not informed about its effects. Under no circumstances must any subject leave the confines of an instance of <i>SCP-9104</i> without express prior permission from at least one (1) Level 4 or higher researcher.<br><br><h3><br>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-9104</i> is a never-ending set of rooms linked by corridors. There are an infinite amount of rooms, but they have been catalogued as <i>SCP-9104</i>-1 through -███. Each instance is identical to the others, with the exception of minor variations in floor plan and furnishings. In addition, each room can be accessed from any other room within <i>SCP-9104</i> through the use of doorways placed at random locations along the walls. The entrances will be disguised as ordinary doorways whenever possible, often changing between instances to better fit with any given theme (a library might have bookshelves replacing doors; a hospital might have an open doorway leading into an operating room).<br><br>When one enters an instance of <i>SCP-9104</i> (hereafter referred to as <i>"rooms"</i>), they will find that it appears identical to its surroundings outside. Even if one enters using another entrance than that which was used upon exiting, the inside will appear identical; however it does not always lead directly back outside or into another instance. If one attempts to leave through any means other than exiting by way of another entrance they will find themselves in a hallway connecting two instances exactly like those found within Site-64. This hallway has no apparent end or beginning and is unconnected with reality beyond its borders; no anomalies are able to enter this corridor even if their effects would allow them access (however objects can pass freely through). If one exits via another entrance placed along this corridor they will reappear in the original instance they entered from unless that room has since been destroyed or otherwise altered beyond recognition due to anomalous events occurring within it; in such cases subjects may reappear anywhere else within Site 64 where more instances exist without further complications.. No physical matter can pass between these hallways and reality besides air particles present around people's bodies unless something passes out first .<br><br>Subjects who travel long distances throughout these halls may notice changes happening around them even though there are no visible signs of what caused them . For example , all furniture inside rooms may suddenly disappear for periods up until three days , then return exactly how it was before disappearing for seemingly no reason . Furniture may also spontaneously move around during this time , including individuals who do not move out on their own ; however once everything returns back into place everything returned back exactly how it was before movement occurred without anyone being aware anything had happened . These phenomena occur even when subjects are completely isolated from external stimuli so long as there exists at least one<br><br><h3><br>Recovery:</h3> <i>SCP-9104</i> was first discovered after an incident involving <i>SCP-</i>████ and the deaths of ██ subjects during a containment breach . Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 (aka <i>"Flying High"</i>) were dispatched to investigate an anomalous object that had appeared within Site 64 that was believed to be the cause of the incident. The object turned out to be an instance of <i>SCP-9104</i>, and as such MTF Gamma-6 was assigned as permanent security detail for further instances that may appear. During this time they catalogued all known instances .<br><br><h3>Addendum 9104.1 :</h3> Interview with Dr. ████ ██████<br><br><br>Interviewed: Dr. ████ ██████, Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 Commander and chief researcher into <i>SCP-9104</i>.<br><br><br>Interviewer: Researcher Dr.<br> Merriweather Foreword: This interview was conducted to gain a greater understanding of <i>SCP-9104</i>'s origin and properties . <Begin Log><br> Merriweather: Thank you for agreeing to this interview, doctor; we appreciate your time. We would like to know about the discovery of <i>SCP-9104</i> and how you came to develop containment procedures for it.<br><br>Dr.<br>██████: Gladly, doctor! As I'm sure you're aware from our previous interviews the first instances of 9104 appeared during a containment breach that involved that thing with the tentacles…<br> Merriweather: Yes , let's start from there . How did it happen ? What happened exactly ? Dr .<br>██████ : The whole thing started when one of those bitchy religious lunatics decided to throw herself onto our precious little tentacle monster because she thought it was going to hell or something ; so naturally we had no choice but to shoot her in self defense . After she died a bunch more nut jobs showed up and started throwing themselves at us too which led us into shooting them as well as breaking out tear gas after they refused any form of negotiation or compromise , then finally those idiots from upstairs sent in some drones armed with flamethrowers which barely even dented their numbers… After several hours we were finally able to get things under control by using explosive collars on ourselves while wearing bulletproof armor along with sending in robots loaded down with EMP grenades but by then half my men were dead or wounded , including two who got hit by bullets ricocheting off the walls due their armor being damaged by another explosion at point blank range . All told I lost eight men before getting everything under control … But what really pissed me off afterwards was finding out afterwards that none of this shit would have ever happened if they hadn't sent drones inside instead of sending in proper military units like I requested ; so needless to say morale is pretty low right now - oh sorry I mean high! Hahaha!<br> Merriweather : That's quite alright , please continue … D r .<br>████████ : Okay well after all my men were accounted for they assigned me head researcher on 9104 since not only am I considered one of Site 64s best researchers but also since they needed someone else who could watch over these things just in case another incident occurred; So now here we are now fifteen months later still trying figure out what makes this anomaly tick along with keeping an eye open for any more unexpected incidents like last time… Oh sorry sorry sorry ! You didn't want details about how screwed up things got over there during initial recovery did ya? If ya don't mind me asking why exactly do ya need them? (Dr.████████ looks visibly nervous) Sorry again ! Forgot myself again … er<br><br><h3>Addendum 9104.2 :</h3> Dr.██████'s Interview With Researcher Dr. ██████</div>
