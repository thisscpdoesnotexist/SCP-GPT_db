How are you today? : Fine, thank you for asking. I'm here to answer your questions about <i>SCP-10081</i>, is that correct? Dr.: Yes, but before we begin could you please tell me how long have you known about it? : Well… I don't know exactly when it started but the first time I heard of it was when my mother told me that she knew a secret and didn't want anyone else to know about it so she asked me not to tell anyone what she said next and then she told me that cats all over the world were hiding a dark secret from humans and if they ever found out what this secret was they would be very angry with us and kill us all so we had better never tell them what this secret is or else they will find out! And then… well… I don't really remember much after that because at that point my mom started crying really hard and hugged me very tightly while saying <i>"I'm sorry"</i> over and over again until someone took her away from our house for her own safety… It's been almost four years since then but every time I think about what happened back then my heart starts beating faster than usual which makes me feel like something bad is going to happen soon so I try not to think about it too much because thinking about bad things can make them come true sometimes! (At this point Mr.) began sobbing uncontrollably for several minutes before regaining control of himself once more. Dr.: Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr.. You may go now if you wish. <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>After conducting several interviews with cats who claimed not having heard of <i>SCP-10081</i> prior to its discovery by Foundation personnel as well as those who did claim such knowledge the results were inconclusive with regards whether or not cats actually possess knowledge regarding <i>SCP-10081</i> or are simply aware through other means (such as osmosis) of its existence without knowing exactly what it is in detail due their lack of understanding human language as well as their inability (or unwillingness) in comprehending complex concepts such as [DATA EXPUNGED] which would explain why some subjects expressed confusion upon being asked directly whether or not they knew anything regarding <i>SCP-10081</i> despite having previously claimed doing so during previous interviews conducted by other researchers assigned to Project [REDACTED].<br><br><h3>Addendum 10081.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment 10081-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-10081</i>.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The subject is to be presented with a bowl of milk. Milk is to be poured into the bowl until the subject consumes it all. The subject is then to be given another bowl of milk, and so on until the subject refuses or becomes unable to consume any more milk due to fullness or lactose intolerance. This experiment was conducted on ██/██/████ at ████ University in ███████, Ohio by Dr. ██████ and was observed by Agent █████████ and Agent [REDACTED].<br><br></div>
