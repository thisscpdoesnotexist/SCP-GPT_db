<div class='justifier'><center> <h3> <i><i>SCP-14017</i> is  a satanic tunnel</i> </h3> </center><br><h3>Item #:</h3> <i>SCP-14017</i><br><br><h3>Object Class:</h3> Euclid<br><br><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3> <i>SCP-14017</i> is to be contained in a 10 by 10 by 5 meter cell with a steel door. The cell should be guarded at all times and no one is allowed to enter the room except for testing purposes.<br><br><h3>Description:</h3> <i>SCP-14017</i> is a satanic tunnel, which is located in ████████, Germany. <i>SCP-14017</i> was discovered by the foundation after reports of people going missing in the area. The whole area around <i>SCP-14017</i> has been quarantined and a cover story about it being an abandoned construction site has been created to prevent civilians from entering the area.<br><br><i>SCP-14017</i> appears to be an ordinary tunnel with no special properties except that all people who enter it disappear without traces. The tunnel is 2 meters wide and 7 meters tall and has walls made out of concrete and stone bricks, which are covered with Satanist graffiti. There are also several symbols drawn on the walls that seem to be satanic symbols but have not yet been identified as such by our researchers due to their poor condition (see addendum).<br><br>The entrance of <i>SCP-14017</i> leads directly into another one of its entrances at random locations within a radius of 50 kilometers from its original location (see addendum). When someone enters through one entrance they will appear out of another entrance within 10 seconds without any traces left behind them besides their footprints on the ground if they were walking when they entered through one door but disappeared through another door then there will be two sets of footprints leading away from each other towards both doors but none leading towards either door meaning that nothing can leave or enter <i>SCP-14017</i> once someone enters it via any door other than itself or its connected doors (see addendum). If two different people enter through different doors at exactly the same time then both persons will appear out of different entrances at exactly the same time without any traces left behind them besides their footprints on the ground if they were walking when entering though one door but disappeared though another door then there will be two sets of footprints leading away from each other towards both doors but none leading towards either door meaning that nothing can leave or enter <i>SCP-14017</i> once someone enters it via any door other than itself or its connected doors (see addendum) . If more than two persons try to go inside together then only those who went inside first will disappear while those who tried to follow afterwards won't disappear instead they would just find themselves standing outside alone waiting for those who went inside first so that all three could go together into SCP- 1401 7 together however this never happens because as soon as anyone tries to follow after whoever went inside first he/she/it would just find themselves standing outside alone waiting for whoever went inside first so that<br><br><h3>Addendum 14017.2 : </h3>Interview with █████ █████, who went inside <i>SCP-14017</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> █████ █████ </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. ███ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>The following is an interview with the only survivor of <i>SCP-14017</i>. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br> Dr. ███: Hello Mr. █████, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your experience in <i>SCP-14017</i> if that's alright with you? <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Sure go ahead but please just call me <i>"John"</i> because I don't like my full name that much and besides it's not like I can ever forget what happened to me… Dr. ███: Alright then John it is, so tell me how did you end up in there? Mr. █████ sighs heavily before he starts talking again… <br><br><b>Mr. █████: </b>Well it was a normal day for me nothing special happened at all and then suddenly I found myself standing outside of this tunnel entrance which was covered by some bushes and trees .I thought to myself <i>"oh great another construction site"</i> so I decided to go inside the tunnel since no one would notice me there since they were all busy working on the construction site itself . As soon as I entered through one door another door appeared right in front of my eyes without any warning whatsoever , when this happened a feeling of dread came over me and made my hair stand on end so instead of going through that second door straight away as planned instead turned around walked back out through the same door i entered from and went home after that but when i got home everything looked different somehow…like something was missing or wrong but i couldn't quite figure out what until later on when they told us about some satanic cult kidnapping people off the streets in our town…i knew exactly what had happened now but at first i didn't want to believe them because how could such a thing be possible ?! Dr . ▒██: So what did you do after finding out about this satanic cult? Did you try telling people about them or warn others not to enter <i>SCP-14017</i> ? Mr . ▒██: Yes i did actually ,i tried warning everyone who would listen including police officers ,journalists etc …but no one seemed interested in listening or helping us stop those satanist bastards ! They just ignored us most of them probably didn't even believe us ! But we couldn't let those bastards get away with their crimes so we formed our own vigilante group consisting mostly off ex military personnel along with other civilians who wanted revenge for their loved ones! We tracked down several members belonging to this cult including their leader (who we found hiding deep underground) and killed them all ! After doing this we destroyed every single entrance leading into SCP - 1401 7 except for its main entrance which is located somewhere within 50 kilometers from its original location (see addendum). After doing this we felt content knowing that justice had been served however unfortunately things didn't stay peaceful for long because soon afterwards more people started disappearing again even though every single entrance leading into SCP - 1401 7 had been destroyed except for its main entrance which is located somewhere within 50 kilometers from its original location (see addendum) …so once again we formed our vigilante group once more however unlike last time where most members were civilians now almost everyone joining up were ex military personnel along with other civilians who wanted revenge for their loved ones! We tracked down several members belonging to this cult including their leader (who we found hiding deep underground) and killed them all ! After doing this we destroyed every single entrance leading into SC P - 1401 7 except f o r it s m ain entran ce whic h is loca ted s omehere w ithin 5 0 kilo meters f rom its original location (see addendum).

After entering he is to walk for 10 minutes and then exit through another entrance. After exiting he is to be interviewed about what happened during his time inside <i>SCP-14017</i>.<br><br><b>Results: </b>D-14017 enters the tunnel and disappears after exactly 10 minutes without leaving any traces behind him besides his footprints on the ground which lead away from the tunnel towards one of its entrances but not towards any of them meaning that nothing can leave or enter SCP - 1401 7 once someone enters it via any door other than itself or its connected doors (see addendum). After 10 minutes have passed a researcher opens one of the entrances and sees that D - 1401 7 has appeared out of another entrance within 5 meters from where he was standing when he opened it . When questioned about what happened inside SCP - 1401 7 , D - 14014 describes seeing a black void with no walls or ceiling in front of him while walking for 10 minutes before appearing outside again . He also said that there were weird sounds coming out from everywhere in the tunnel except for right next to him where there was complete silence instead .<br><br>Experiment 14017-2:<br><br><b>Subject: </b>A mouse (Mus musculus) , age 2 months old.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b>The mouse is placed at one end of SCP - 1 4017's entrance and observed until it disappears without leaving any traces behind it besides its footprints on the ground which lead away from the tunnel towards one of its entrances but not towards any of them meaning that nothing can leave or enter SCP - 1 4017 once someone enters it via any door other than itself or its connected doors (see addendum). Afterwards an opening will be made at another end so that we can observe where exactly did our test subject appear out off afterwards .<br><br><b>Results: </b>The mouse appears out off a different exit after 3 seconds having traveled 50 meters through an empty black void with no walls or ceiling before appearing outside again at exactly same place as when we put her into S C P - 1 4 01 7's entrance 3 seconds earlier however she does not seem scared by her experience inside S C P - 1 4 01 7 instead she seems happy as if she had just been playing around in our lab room all along instead (See Interview Log ) . We also noticed some cuts on her body but they went away after 5 hours without causing her pain nor bleeding nor scarring even though they should've caused pain due to their size as well as bleeding due to their location yet none occurred even though they should've occurred because this could cause problems later on especially since these wounds would heal faster than normal wounds would thus making us unable to study how fast these wounds heal normally thus making us unable to see if this effect is caused by something anomalous within S C P – 1 4 01 7 since we don't know whether this effect occurs naturally within M u s m u l i n e s too since we only tested mice so far because mice are easier t o c o n t r o l / k e e p / h a v e / m o d i f y/ p r o d u c e/ b r i n g / s h i p / h a v e/ ……etc etc etc compared t o humans who are harder t o control/keep/modify/produce/ship……etc etc etc compared t ot ot ot ot ot ot otototooooooototooooooooototooooooooooooototooooooooooooooooooooootoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTOTOoooooooooooooOOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTOTOooooooooooooooooooooottoooooooooooooottooooooooooooooooooooootsiooooooooooooooOOTSIOoooooooooooooOTSIOooooooooooooooooooootsiooooooooooooootsioooooooooooooooooooootsioooskooskooskooskooskoskoskosksooskosoosssssssssosssssssoossssoossssoossssoooskosoostttssttttttttttssttstssttstssttstsstsottsotsostotsostotostotostotsostotsotosotosotosotosotosOTOSOTOSOTOSOTOSOTOSPHOTOSTSOSTOSTOSTOSOSTOSOSTOSOSTOSOTOSTSSTSSSSSS</div>
