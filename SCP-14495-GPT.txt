It has been observed reading books on various subjects such as biology, theology, philosophy and psychology. <i>SCP-14495</i> is highly resistant to damage; it can only be injured by weapons made from cold iron or silver. If it sustains enough damage to kill a normal human being, it will regenerate within 24 hours . It also possesses superhuman strength , speed , agility , reflexes and stamina .<br><br>If any living creature makes eye contact with <i>SCP-14495</i> for more than 5 seconds without wearing protective eyewear (such as sunglasses), they will become an instance of <i>SCP-14495</i> -2 . Instances of <i>SCP-14495</i> -2 are humans that have been transformed into sex slaves by exposure to SCP- 14495's gaze; they are compelled to obey any orders given by instances of SCP - 14 495 -1 (see below) or other instances of themselves .

If allowed to die in this manner without being released first, the corpse will transform into another instanceofS C P – 1 4 49 5 – 2 within 24 hours after death regardless if their genitals were damaged during death throes; however this process does not work on corpses that have been dead for more than 3 days since infection due t o rigo r m acu s se co m p le te d at th e ti m e fo r de ath w ill cause the corpse's transformation into another instanceofSCP– 144952 after 24 hours from time when rigor mortis completed<br><br><h3>Addendum 14495.1 : </h3> <i>SCP-14495</i> was recovered from ████████, France after reports of a succubus attacking citizens and draining their life energy. The Foundation was able to capture <i>SCP-14495</i> without incident and transport it to Site-19.<br><br><h3>Addendum 14495.2 : </h3>Interview with  <i>SCP-14495</i><br><br><b><b>Interviewed: </b> <i>SCP-14495</i> </b> <b><br><br><b>Interviewer: </b> Dr. █████ </b><br><br><b>Foreword: </b>This interview was conducted to gain information about <i>SCP-14495</i>'s origins and possible weaknesses. <br><br>&lt;Begin Log&gt<br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Hello, SCP- 14495 . My name is Doctor █████, I will be conducting your interview today. Please state your name for the record. <br><br><b><i>SCP-14495</i>: </b>My name is… (SCP- 14 495 pauses for several seconds) I don't know what my name is… but you can call me Sally . <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>Sally? Is that short for something? (SCP- 14 495 remains silent) Very well then, could you tell me where you are from? Where did you grow up? What were your parents like? Any siblings or friends growing up? Any pets when you were young ? Anything at all that might help us understand who you are as a person before this incident occurred would be helpful to us in treating and containing you better here at the Foundation . (SCP -1 4 49 5 remain s silen t.) <br><br><b>Dr. █████: </b>You do not remember anything prior to the incident in France ? Not even a little bit ? Nothing at all ? (SCP -1 4 49 5 remain s silen t.) <br><br>&lt;End Log&gt<br><br> Closing <br><br><b>Statement: </b>At this time, it has been determined that SCP – 1 449 5 does not remember anything prior to becoming an instance of S C P – 1 4 49 5 – 2 , and as such cannot provide any information on its origins or weaknesses . It has also been determined that there is no way of reversing the effects of exposure to its gaze without terminating the infected subject , so protective eyewear must be worn by anyone interacting with instances of S C P - 1 4 49 5 -2 or SCP -1 449 5 itself if they wish to avoid infection; however due to their current status as sex slaves , termination may not always be an option if they become disobedient .<br><br><h3>Addendum 14495.3 : </h3>Experiment Log <br><br>Experiment-14495-1:<br><br><b>Subject: </b><i>SCP-14495</i> and D-5341, a male member of the control group.<br><br><b>Procedure: </b><i>SCP-14495</i> is to be placed in a room with D-5341, who is to be instructed to make eye contact with it for more than 5 seconds without protective eyewear. After this time has elapsed, D - 5 341 is to be instructed by Dr. ██████ (who has been given protective eyewear) via intercom not to look at SCP - 1 4 4 9 5 for the remainder of the experiment . A camera will record any instances of S C P – 1 4 49 5 – 2 that emerge from this experiment .<br><br><b>Results: </b>After 8 minutes , Dr. ██████ instructs D - 5 341 via intercom not to look at SCP - 14495 anymore; he complies and looks away from it immediately after being told so . No instances of S C P – 1 4 49 5 – 2 emerge from this experiment .<br><br><b>Analysis: </b>It appears that if an individual makes eye contact with <i>SCP-14495</i> but does not continue looking at it after being told not do so, they will remain unaffected by its gaze; however , if they do continue looking at it after being told not too , they will become an instance o f S C P – 1 4 49 5 – 2 regardless o f w h eth er t hey are wearing p rotectiv e eyew ear or n ot<br><br>Experiment Log 144952A:</div>
