When presented with such text, <i>SCP-15286</i> will begin generating output which describes future events using the same style and tone as the input text. The predicted events described by <i>SCP-15286</i> are always accurate, with one <br><br><b>exception: </b>all predictions made by <i>SCP-15286</i> regarding human death will be inaccurate . This inaccuracy manifests as a failure to describe the cause of death or any other details surrounding it; instead, these sections will be replaced with ellipses (…).<br><br><h3>Addendum 15286.1 : </h3>𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝐻𝑜 𝐶<br><br>On ██/██/████, <i>SCP-15286</i> was used in a test involving the description of a hypothetical scenario involving SCP-████.
